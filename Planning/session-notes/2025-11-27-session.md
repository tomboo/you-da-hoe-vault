# Session 2025-11-27

## Summary
Configured Obsidian plugins for the vault and discussed approach to frontmatter schema design. Decided to move the frontmatter work to firebase-depot project.

## Work Completed

### Vault Setup
- Configured Obsidian community plugins
- Installed: Longform, Novel Word Count, Templater, Typewriter Mode

### Planning/Architecture
- Discussed frontmatter properties and prepopulate values
- Explored metadata structure in Library scenes
- Decided to work on frontmatter schema in firebase-depot project instead

## Statistics
- Session duration: ~30 minutes
- Words added: 0 (setup work only)
- Files modified: 1 (.obsidian/community-plugins.json)
- Files created: 15 (plugin files)

## Next Session Goals
- [ ] Switch to firebase-depot project
- [ ] Export all you-da-hoe metadata to CSV for analysis
- [ ] Design improved frontmatter properties schema
- [ ] Modify convert & enhance process to generate new frontmatter
- [ ] Test and iterate on schema design

## Notes
- No creative writing work this session
- Focus was on tooling and workflow optimization
- Better to design frontmatter schema where the data lives (firebase-depot)
- Can re-export Library scenes with improved frontmatter once schema is finalized

## Architecture Decision
Moving frontmatter schema work to firebase-depot because:
1. Access to full metadata from Firebase records
2. Can test with actual convert & enhance pipeline
3. Proper integration point for auto-generation
4. Easier to iterate with all data visible

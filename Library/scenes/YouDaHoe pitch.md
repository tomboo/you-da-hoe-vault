You-Da-Hoe Novel Pitch

**You-Da-Hoe by Cynthia Hartwig**

1\)

A group of teenagers on the cusp of adulthood are locked up together in a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho that's supposed to transform them from crazy to sane but nobody seems to realize that the doctor who runs things is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there while a real psychopath stalks the treatment center in a garbage truck.

Told in alternating voices in a braided narrative, You-Da-Hoe asks the reader to decide what and who is really crazy when life is filled with unavoidable tragedy and loss. At the emotional center of the story is a parentless 17-year-old who calls herself Old Girl who has to choose between killing herself and living to tell the tale of how she survives ia nut house without losing her mind.

2\) Short

An exploration of the fragility of sanity in the face of tragedy and loss, You-Da-Hoe tells a tragi-comic story of adolescent craziness when you're trying to grow up and define a self. A loner who just wants to kill herself; a stoner who can't face the fact that he ran over his best friend; a bulimic shoplifter who mistakes indiscriminate sex for connection; a star student who loses her baby and can't find herself. Everybody at Inner Journeys is struggling to survive at a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho where the head doctor is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there and a real psychopath circles the facility in a garbage truck.

3)Second person version

When you were in your teens, did you ever do anything stupid or crazy? Can you imagine getting drunk or stoned on 'luud's and then accidentally driving over your best friend? What if your mom and dad and baby brother got taken out by a half-blind senior citizen who couldn't tell the difference between the gas pedal and the brake -- would you want to climb the highest tree and just let go? If you had a baby and it was snatched away at the hospital, would you do something even crazier than the crazy thing that got you locked up in a psychiatric treatment program for troubled teens in backwoods Idaho called Inner Journeys without a shred of irony?

You-Da-Hoe tells the story of a group of troubled adolescents on a continuum between garden-variety crazy and mentally instable who are locked up at Inner Journeys, a psychiatric treatment program outside Couer D'Alene, Idaho, in the middle of winter where even the weather is against them. The novel is told in a braided narrative that shifts between the troubled teens who might be crazy, Dr. Hazey, the head doctor, who is definitely crazy, and a violent psychopath who stalks the residents in a garbage truck.

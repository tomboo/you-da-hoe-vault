Novel Review by Waverly

Margaret could see raccoons in the garbage at Hazey\'s -- scattering food. Or maybe the raccoons are at Healing House and there\'s a war declared on them by Hazey and a paintball gun is locked in a closet. They could be out the night of the fire when the fire truck comes and a firefighter lights them up in the trees like masked faces in the middle of neon fire bursts.

Naturally the kids are forbidden to shoot the gun until maybe Reza or Esty show off a talent far being a crack shot.

121318 Margaret looks for the Aurora Borealis

Margaret loved Idaho. It was her home.

She stepped out on the screened in porch where they kept wood stacked for the wood stove. It was bitterly cold in just her stocking feet, but she was on the lookout for the Aurora Borealis, so it was worth it.

She looked at the clear sky. High, bright stars. No Northern Lights, though it was the weather for it. High clouds meant it would continue cold. No snow for a few days. She'd take cold over snow any day now that she had figured out how to get Dr. Hazey to pay for many new cords of wood.

It was so beautiful in Idaho.

The stars were sharp and crystal clear against absolute blackness in one of the few places on Earth that wasn't yet a victim of light pollution. The moon looked like a crescent of cheese, which made Margaret about-face and bolt back into the kitchen to save the milk for the cocoa from boiling over.

My beautiful Idaho, she thought, drinking hot chocolate to make her sleepy and watching the golden moon sliding across the sky on its way to slip under the \_\_\_\_\_\_ Mountains. She reviewed her children---first, the biological ones, then the ones at the Program who should be asleep in their beds. Lydia was still missing. No one had called her to say she was OK. Probably with that loose screw, Jed -- damn, Ned\-- Simplot. Now Lydia had her mixing his name up too. He was one of the lesser Simplots, born far from the tap root of the potato fortune, where the bloodline ran out, she supposed.

She sent up a little prayer for the continued safety of her families, the biological one and the adopted one. She excepted Crazy Hazey from her prayer. She had big plans for the good doctor at nine AM.

120818 Queef word play and 2018 opening

James and Reza conversation or Rachel and OG?

"You know what queef is?"

"Something you shoot up or ingest?"

"It means "expulsion of air through the vagina."

"A vagina fart? Gag me!"

"I don't think they smell."

"Really?"\
"They just squeak."

"You know there's an English meal called bubble and squeak," said James, trying to change the subject

But does it come from the vagina, Reza wanted to know.

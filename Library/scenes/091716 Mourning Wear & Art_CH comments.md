I am SO excited to be here with all of you and with my extremely dear friend Anastacia Tolbert. I'm her opening act tonight.

I wrote a shitty first draft of this essay when I was here at Mineral School three months ago. Then I put it away and did not look at it again until this morning. I spent the afternoon sitting on the porch, revising it, and now I'm sharing it with all of you. A rash and brazen act.

This essay is harder to hear than it is to read on the page, because it's a braided essay. There are four sections to the essay, each bookended by a short description of one item in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Those five items are all examples of mourning art---framed pictures and jewelry that people once made to honor to dead. The titles of those sections of the essay are the actual titles given to the items by the art museum.

Trigger warning, with apologies: this essay is about death. But that seems to be the subject of the day, so this is in honor of Jim Hale and Star Roberts' sister and mother.

**Eliza Hall's Embroidered Mourning Picture,** **1823\**
Eliza Hall's sadness shudders in artless lines of silk and ink. Bushes rise dark and impenetrable behind her sloped shoulders. Willow branches rain down gloom. Before her feet, crooked gravestones rise like fungus from muck. Black. Burnt. One stone reads, in an unsure hand, "Oh grave, where is thy Eden?"

**What to** **Wear**

The night before my mother's memorial service, my sister-in-law and I realized that we had nothing to wear. Three weeks earlier we had spent one long day sorting through my mother's enormous, walk-in, bedroom closet, throwing out clothes. We filled 22 large garbage bags with clothes for Goodwill, even after pulling out every item we thought we might want to keep. All that excess, and still we needed to go to the mall and buy clothes.

We agreed that we should dress only partly in black. Never having attended a "celebration of life" before, I wasn't sure how the dress code differed from funeral wear, but all black seemed wrong.

Mom and I had never been clothes-shoppers. She had sewn most of her own clothes for half a century, ever since she'd learned how to sew when she was in the fifth grade. Mom made most of my clothes, too, until I finished high school and she announced it was about time I learned how to sew for myself. I had no interest in such womanly tasks---I didn't learn how to sew and I didn't learn how to clothes-shop, either.

I had no idea how to go about the task that faced me on the night before my mother's "celebration of life"---enter a large, anonymous mall and find, within an hour or so, an appropriate, well-fitting outfit for an unhappy event.

My sister-in-law Kate told me that my best chances of finding clothes that would fit were J. Jill and Talbot Petites. Her confidence amazed me. It's one thing to know which brands cut their clothes to your particular body shape---though I can't do that, either---but how does one know which are right for other people's bodies? It was the sort of expertise that I didn't even know existed until I needed it.

Kate was right, of course. I found a complete outfit within thirty minutes: a long-sleeved, cream top in a crinkled, textured fabric that wouldn't show sweat, wrinkles, tears, or food; a long black skirt sufficiently serious, but with a nice swing and elegant shape; and a deep red cardigan to guard against the shivers I was sure to feel. I even found an incongruously elegant, rhinestone-studded hair clip; I could tame my hair if it refused to obey.

**"Suite of Jewelry, Mary Todd Lincoln, about 1860"**

Mary Todd Lincoln's brooch and earrings boast fifty-eight black-gilded diamonds. After the president's death, she auctioned them to pay her debts---a "low...sordid...disgraceful" act, as one newspaper of the time put it. To own fifty-eight diamonds was no disgrace, to be forced to sell them, was. We once bought diamonds to honor the dead, now we pressurize the dead's cremated remains into new diamonds. The art museum's jewelry curator shugs and says, "It's all carbon."

**What to** **Do** **about** **Dad?**

Three days after Mom's death, I had left my parents' house in North Carolina to return home. I left bright bouquets of unwanted flowers crowding every table, other people's Pyrex platters filling the refrigerator, and my father in his easy chair, staring blankly out the window. When I returned five weeks later for Mom's "celebration of life," scheduled on what would have been sixty-fourth birthday, the bouquets still covered the tables, desiccated and crumbling. The casseroles and covered dishes were in the same arrangement on the refrigerator shelves, as if Dad had not opened the fridge door in five weeks.

Kate and I wondered aloud about Dad's dating prospects, which seemed to be strong. My brother recoiled: How could we think that Dad would remarry?

I dismissed Alan's question: How could we think he would *not* remarry?

Dad clearly needed someone to take care of him and I didn't want to be that person.

Alan shrugged. "If Kate were to die, I would be able to cook for myself."

I couldn't follow Alan's logic. He had *always* done most of the cooking in their household. I could count on one hand the dinners that Dad had cooked during our entire childhood.

As Kate and I wandered the shopping mall, looking for appropriately somber-but-not-depressing outfits, we talked about Alan's surprise at the idea that Dad would remarry. How naïve. How sweet. Kate's own father had died when she was twelve; her mother had never remarried. "She always wanted to remarry, but she never had the opportunity," Kate said. Sadness ballooned in my chest. Our aspirations are sometimes so simple, yet so unattainable. And so misunderstood. The day of Alan and Kate's wedding, Mom had whispered to me about Kate's mother: "She mourned her dead husband forever."

As Kate and I walked into J. Jill, its white façade blazing like a furious sun, my sister-in-law turned to me. "A friend told me recently, 'Kate, women mourn and men replace.'" I started to laugh. That plain-faced statement explained the order of things in the world I'd been thrust into---a world of one dead parent, a houseful of dead flower arrangements, and twenty-two garbage bags of unwanted clothes. The oversimplification struck my mourning heart as so real that I couldn't stop laughing, stumbling into the over-bright store, into another foreign world I was managing, *somehow*, to navigate.

**"Mourning pendant brooch by Rowland Parry, 1792"**

![](./media/image2.tiff){width="5.513888888888889in" height="6.138888888888889in"}

A world encased in one glass oval made from human hair and elephant tusk. Art rendered from what living bodies expel. Burnished gold frames lives lost. A black-clad woman points heavenward, toward the image of two angels in a boat. A weeping willow, made of the tiny angels' hair, hangs down in braids from the heavens. Two children float down the River Jordan in a tiny boat. The hem of their mother's mourning dress crumples on pale grass. Shadows lie down before her. "Not lost, but gone *before*," the funeary pedestal reads. The mother can only look skyward and wait; the River Jordan refuses to carry her home.

**What to Eat**

The day after my mother's memorial service, Alan, Kate, and Dad went back to work. I was the only one left to receive a final gift to my mother: a Chinese banquet. The best man at my parents' wedding forty-two years earlier, Houchi Dung, had flown from Taiwan to be present at her memorial service and honor her memory.

Mom's extended family had already returned home, so the guests honoring my mother's memory at Spring Garden Chinese Restaurant were my dad's sister and brother and four of his nieces and nephews. Dad's small-town Michigan family hated nothing so much as unfamiliar food, a category that included American Chinese restaurant cuisine.

Five years earlier, I had eaten at a steakhouse with my cousins---the last time I'd seen them. The waiter had set down a massive plate of beef and baked potato, with five perfectly steamed spears of asparagus. My cousin grimaced at his plate, leaned over to me, and stage-whispered, "I just *hate* it when you order meat and potatoes and they ruin it by putting a bunch of vegetables on top."

Houchi, in a perfectly pressed pin-striped suit, regarded Spring Garden's enormous menu carefully. He rejected all the pre-set "group meal" options and placed an elaborate order in Cantonese. Five minutes later he changed he order. Then changed it again. The waitress, flustered and harried, brought out dish after dish, filling the large lazy-susan in the middle of the table, then placing dishes between our elbows. A huge flower of oily, colorful platters bloomed before us.

Aunt Donna, always the most adventuresome of Dad's ten brothers and sisters, praised the food and kept up the conversation. My uncle and four cousins eyed the platters warily, looking for pieces of meat that seemed safe to add to the scoops of sticky rice on their lunch plates. Aunt Donna pushed the lazy susan around and around, as I made sure to spoon something from every platter on to my already heaping plate. Alternate waves of gratitude and embarrassment and nausea rose within me.

**"Mourning bracelet, about 1848, human hair braided, glass and gold metal engraved"**

In this tiny golden rectangle lies a heart knotted with pain. The threads of shared life in memory's quipu. This golden space barely contains the grief, braided and twisted upon itself. A wrist's hairshirt bristles with unforgiven actions, needlepricks of regret. Within each turn of a hairstrand, each twist of braid, gleams unforgotten time. Still, this bracelet represents hope: may emptiness eventually replace regret.

**What to Say**

Four months before the Spring Garden Chinese Restaurant banquet, Houchi had arrived midday at my parents' front door. My mother was home alone and mortified by his unexpected visit from the other side of the world. She invited him into the small, rarely used living room and offered him tea. They chatted politely, about moments of their lives in the forty-three years since Houchi and Dad had been grad-school roommates, when Mom was still the fiancée and Houchi had gone by "Howard." After precisely one hour, Houchi stood, bowed to Mom and said, "You have had a good life." Then he left.

Mom was irritated. Why had he shown up unannounced? Why had he thought it his business to pronounce her life "good"?

When I consider all our friends' and family members' and neighbors' reactions to Mom's illness and death, Houchi's strikes me as the most deeply thoughtful and respectful. He did not want to cause any bother and he knew Mom would have spent hours cleaning and cooking if she'd known he was coming. He understood the importance of visiting in person to talk with his old friend, not about her illness or about possible miracle cures, but about her life as she had chosen to live it. He was, in the truest sense of the term, paying his respects.

Now that Mom was gone and we sat around the Spring Garden Chinese Restaurant table, Houchi was paying his respects once again. I was not so generous. I silently cursed my family for leaving me to host our picky-eater relatives---most of whom I'd seen twice in twenty years---and to receive the gift of the banquet.

I am sure that I handled Houchi's gift all wrong; I was probably supposed to make a speech about my mother and their 43-year friendship, or say something in particular about each of the Cantonese dishes, or about each of the guests, but the ritual was entirely unknown to me. And so I ate far more fried pork and sweet peppers than I cared to, laughed at Aunt Donna's jokes, and smiled and nodded.

When it was time for my aunt, uncle, and cousins to fly back to Michigan, and for Houchi to fly back to Taipei, I gave them each a tight hug and thanked them for making the long trip to celebrate my mother's life and mark her death. The huge flower of food still filled the table, a mostly uneaten offering to the dead.

Houchi stood, bowed deeply to each of us, and said, "This was *not* a good Chinese banquet."

**Eliza Hall's Embroidered Mourning Picture,** **1823\**
Eliza embroidered a self-portrait of grief: her left hand covers her face with a limp kerchief and her black-edged dress hangs down like a church bell. She leans on a funerary pedestal with a slack arm. A shaky script on the pedestal reads:

In the cold mansions of the silent tomb

How still the solitude

How deep the gloom

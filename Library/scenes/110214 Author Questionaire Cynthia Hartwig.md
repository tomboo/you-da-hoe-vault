110214 Author Questionaire Cynthia Hartwig

**Is this a mainstream book? Art house? Who could you see publishing it?**

I think the market will decide if my novel called You-Da-Hoe is a mainstream book. I have written a great story, a character driven page-turner with a lot of careful attention to language and a world view that like life, includes plenty of tragedy to laugh at while we endure.

I can see two paths for publishing.

1)  Assuming it's as good as I think it is, I could sell You-Da-Hoe to FSG or Houghton Mifflin or a regional literary press like Graywolf or Algonquin Press.

2)  Assuming it's not as literary as I think it is, but still a good story, I can see self-publishing it on Amazon and building an audience for it the old fashioned way, one book at a time.

I grew up in advertising and marketing so I feel comfortable with all the tasks of self-publishing including marketing, cover design, working with a freelance editor and copy-editor, proofreading, hiring a publicity firm in Portland that I admire, etc. I understand book distribution from years on the Copper Canyon Press board and know how to do SEO and keyword essentials that will make my book appear in search. I write regularly for Amazon/audible and understand many of the drivers for the on-line market place.

I'm not at all confident that any publishing department at a traditional publisher will do a better job than I will, so part of me wonders if I should skip traditional publishing's rat race which is in disarray and aim to become the next Deb Reed or Tyler Dilts, who both sell literary stories very well on Amazon.

It would help to win Amazon's Break Through novel contest and that's why I am driving for completing a tightly edited draft by Feb. 1.

**List a few comps (authors and books) with a similar audience that have sold well in the past twenty years.**

Vernon God Little by DBC Pierre

When Will There Be Good News and Left Early, Took My Dog by Kate Atkinson

Sometimes the Wolfe by Urban Waite

Things We Set on Fire by Deb Reed

My audience are female readers who like a good story with careful attention to language. My readers like fiction and creative nonfiction with a tragic edge and wicked humor.

My antecedent in the way, way back is Dicken's dark story of Pip and Magwitch. You-Da-Hoe harkens back to Great Expectations updated to 2014 morals and ambiguity.

**What is the emotional tone of the book?**

The emotional tone of my book is tragi-comedy. It deals with crazy adolescents who do crazy things that in some lights look insane and in other lights, sad. My story is an emotional roller-coaster with the highs and lows of that period we all go through when we make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Hormones and lack of perspective and a loopy innocence combined with a need for autonomy drive a lot of insane decisions throughout the book.

**If you had to sum up the book in a short paragraph, what would you write?**

When you were in your teens did you ever do anything stupid or crazy? Can you imagine getting drunk or stoned on 'luud's and poppers and then accidentally driving over your best friend? Or what if your mom and dad and baby brother got taken out by a half-blind senior citizen who couldn't tell the difference between the gas pedal and the brake -- would you want to climb the highest tree and let go? Or maybe if you had sex and got pregnant and the baby you thought you were going to cuddle with was snatched away at the hospital, would you do something even crazier than the crazy thing you did that got you locked up in a psychiatric treatment program for troubled teens in rural Idaho? Would you be able to go from crazy to sane shut off from everyone and everything you know at a place they call Inner Journeys without a shred of irony?

Six adolescents at the cusp of adulthood are thrown together in a treatment program where crazy behavior is the norm

Six teenagers at the cusp of adulthood are locked up together in a treatment program that's supposed to transform them from crazy to sane but nobody seems to realize that the doctor who runs things is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there while a real psychopath circles the treatment center picking up garbage.

You-Da-Hoe is a story about half a dozen troubled adolescents on a continuum between garden-variety crazy and totally insane, none of whom know where they fit in or why they do what they do. They're all locked up at Inner Journeys, a psychiatric treatment program outside Couer D'Alene, Idaho, in the middle of winter where even the weather is against them. The novel is told in a braided narrative that shifts point-of-view between four troublerd teens who might be crazy, Dr. Hazey, the head doctor, who is definitely crazy, and a violent psychopath who stalks the residents in a garbage truck. At the emotional center of the story is a 17-year-old who calls herself Old Girl because she has to choose between killing herself and living to tell the tale of how she manages to survive her year in a nut house.

Who is the core audience for the book? Age, gender, education politics? Who will the marketing department at your publisher target?

The core audience for You-Da-Hoe are females between 18-55 with troubled adolescents or a history of trouble during their own adolescence. These are core readers, the kind of women who download or buy 8-10 novels or creative nonfiction books a year. College or post-docs, working parents who have two incomes and not enough time to spend with their kids but worry about whether they're parenting correctly and read books about what to do when everything goes to shit.

A sub-audience for You-Da-Hoe are 14-22-year-old young adults who are trying to survive coming of age without coming to disaster. This audience dovetails with the Vernon God Little audience that Little Brown targeted.

My novel skates between a YA audience and an adult audience with its darkness and misbehavior that involves sex, cocaine, bulimia, cutting, and blow jobs in exchange for cigarettes.

**What is the central theme of your novel? What's the book "about" on an idea level?**

The central question in You-Da-Hoe is who and what is crazy? Each of six main characters lies in a different position on the wheel of wackiness that circles from garden variety teen age hormones and limit testing to real depression and anxiety and psychoses that require treatment to sociopathy and psychopathy that leads to killing and murder.

**What is the climax?**

The climax of You-Da-Hoe is at after midnight one cold night in early February when Old Girl, a 17-year-old girl with a suicide fixation, runs away from Inner Journeys and lies down in the middle of a snowy road expecting to be run over by an oncoming car. Old Girl witnesses the crash of Rusty the garbageman's truck into a Ponderosa tree when he's impaled by the steering wheel. She climbs into the cab and holds his hand while he's dying. In the process of accompanying a strange man up to the lip of death, she peers over into the abyss but doesn't follow him over because she wants to live.

**What are the main character's internal goals? What do they want deep down/**

Old Girl wants to kill herself because she wants the pain to stop. Living without her mother and father and baby brother is just too painful to endure. What she wants deep down is to put an end to the suffering and what she has to learn is that pain is part of existence.

James wants to bury the fact that he's a fuck-up responsible for the death of a friend he gave a ride to after a party in Topanga Canyon. He can't see that in order to grow beyond his grub stage, James has to expose the maggot inside him to the open air. He escapes with drugs and weed and booze and downers and poppers but every time he sobers up, he just wants to go back into the haze so he doesn't have to look at his wormy, maggot-ridden soul. James is afraid he's a fuck-up and he's so busy hiding his fucked-upness, he fucks up everything he touches until he stops fucking up by admitting it.

Rachel wants to be whole again. She felt round and full and somehow complete when she was pregnant and then the baby was snatched away from her by her parents who said she wasn't ready to take care of herself let alone a child, so she feels like less than nothing. She is guilt-ridden for losing an essential part of herself and she has to come to terms with losing her childhood and her motherhood with the loss of the baby. "Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater" strikes her as terrible advice; that's what should have happened with Rachel instead of pretending the baby never happened. She has to learn to be OK with being dirty. When she bathes in a tub, she has to accept that she will leave a little grime of guilt andsorrow behind as she learns to live with herself for something she couldn't help.

Leia wants someone to love her no matter how hard she tries to prove herself unlovable with shop-lifting and pathological lying and indiscriminate sex and a desire to throw up everything she consumes in order to show herself how vile she is. All attention, even negative attention is good attention as long as Leia is not ignored. Deep down, Leia wants rules, structure and limits. She has everything she could want except a mother's and a father's attention. If she has to misbehave to get their full attention, the price of empty sex and too many donuts and all the stuff she's stolen that crams her closets is worth it.

**Margaret O'Leary, the Day Supervisor,** is a stew of wants. Deep down, she wants the kids in the treatment program to be OK and fed right and to grow up out of their crazy behavior even though she knows realistically that some of them are more troubled than a pat on the back and a piece of pie will cure. She's not convinced Dr. Hazey's brand of psychobabble and therapy are going to cure them but maybe three squares a day and time away from their crazy self-involved parents with people treat them fairly and try to help will provide enough of a buffer to send them out in the world better than they were when they came to Inner Journeys. She wants to do a good job and she wants to get paid a living wage with benefits for her efforts. She doesn't want Dr. Hazey to take the kids money without helping them; she doesn't want Gretchen to feed them shit or cardboard, no matter how nutritious it is; mostly, she doesn't want to make minimum wage when she could be doing Gretchen's job as a registered dietitian while feeding the kids food they'd actually eat while getting paid enough to feed her family.

**Dr. Hazey, Founder of Inner Journeys,** wants somebody to take care of him. He got into psychotherapy in order to help people initially and then he saw how hard it was to really help people; often they just got sicker or better despite his b est efforts and he really didn't get any care or feeding himself per se, and then the money sidetracked him. There was such an oversupply of sick kids and parents desperate to help them and the fees they paid were seemingly inexhaustible. It didn't matter how much he charged: actually, the more he charged, the more they clambered at the door as if parents could spend their kids out of depression or mental illness or anxiety disorders. He loved the Mercedes and the big McMansion on Wolf Kill Road and the entire closet of Italian shoes that comforted him more than a fully stocked pantry.

He liked having stuff; he just didn't feel like tending it. Why was it so damned hard to find someone to run the program without having to pay them an arm and a leg. He wanted help and he didn't want to pay too much for it so he let things slide and put off decisions until they were past due. He also didn't like to be bothered with managerial decisions. People shouldn't have to be managed, he thought. They should manage themselves---something he wasn't good at, he would admit when things got fucked up. You were damned if you did an damned if you didn't, so it was really just easier to let things lump along until the wheels fell off the track. Laissez faire management was his motto. Heavy on the less and not that fair. Just a little short on the managing.

Told in an alternating braided narrative, You-Da-Hoe asks the reader to decide what and who is really crazy when life is filled with unavoidable tragedy and loss. A parentless girl who just wants to kill herself, a bulimic shoplifter who uses sex for connection, a young mother whose baby is snatched away from her at the hospital, a boy who can't face the fact that he ran over his best friend, all have to learn the difference between garden variety adolescent craziness and true mental illness..

You-Da-Hoe tells the story of five teenagers on the cusp of adulthood who have to learn to grow up in the crazy environment of a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho that's run by a head doctor who's writing prescriptions for people who aren't there and stalked by a psychopath who picks up the garbage and gets an unhealthy fixation on one of the inmates.

Do you know the difference between the garden variety craziness of adolescence and true craziness of mental illness? You'll be forced to find out if you get locked up in a psychiatric treatment program on the edge of the wilderness of Idaho.

**Why do you love this material?**

I feel like my exploration of my relationship with my first boyfriend and my abortion was one of those moments where life could have forked onto a very different path.

Melville's early days in his twenties at sea were the impetus for Moby Dick. That early 20-something time period when one moves from youth to adulthood is a critical part of development and a critical to self-identity.

At the novel's heart is the question, how do we live in the limited time that we have?

A moment of decision in life that goes unrecognized at the moment; only later does the meaning of one's choice become apparent.

In my life, I didn't realize how far I altered my path by running away from Bob and a life in a narrow, squeezed space in order to make my own choices.

Coming of age stories share the experience of moving from innocence to experience, from lost and directionless to moving forward onto some path.

I'm fascinated with the decisions we make as young adults that have a lifelong effect.

All the kids at the treatment program face life choices that will have long term ramifications through out their lives.

I'm fascinated by that time in late youth when we make choices that kick us into adulthood and a fixed identity.

Melville chose to write his life's work about his experiences in his early twenties on a whaling ship; it was the time in his life that he went back to and brought alive so that he could relive the experience of being set on a path in life.

In my early life, I rejected a life of being taken care of though I was very drawn to the money and comfort of Bob's family. Instead, I made my own way. I chose advertising, a kind of parody of a true creative life because it promised both money and power. I could have chosen to be taken care of but I felt instinctively I would be trapped or suffocated under Bob's thumb. Instead, I chose to forge my own way and make my own decisions.

The story of each character in You-Da-Hoe puts them at the decision point when they are choosing how they want to live. Old Girl turns away from the frozen oblivion of suicide and chooses life with all the pain and searing heat that comes with the return of blood flow. Rachel chooses to forgive herself for losing her baby because she was too young and resourceless to take care of another human being. James recognizes his faulty, grub-like self and accepts his failings in order to grow up to be a whole man. Leia decides to act with her money instead of always being acted upon for any scrap of attention.

What I love about this material is its serious questioning of why we are here and how we should live. I go back to those points in my life where I have groped for meaning and made choices not knowing where they will lead.

I'm fascinated with that period of groping and blindness during late adolescence that all of us have gone through. I believe there's a universal choosing of some path in life during that time between late adolescence and early adulthood that's not obvious when it occurs but never-the-less, sets one on the path to one kind of life instead of another.

I love exploring that time in late adolescence when hormones are more powerful than breathing, when all life's choices seem open to us, and yet, when you look back, you see that a fork in the road presented itself.

I'm interested in that time of life when hormones run wild and we're breaking away from authority and trying out drugs and booze and sex as logical life choices along with the normal career choices and where to go to school and who and when to marry. How do we move from coming of age to being of age and getting on a path to aging that we don't regret?

I'm also interested in that fine line between crazy adolescent experimentation and true mental instability or illness. All the characters in You-Da-Hoe share the experience of being out-of-control and fucked-up as young people. They're all at the point in life when they have to engage the clutch and get into first gear which leads to second and third gear and so on till the brake pads wear out and the chassis falls off. A new car can just as easily fly and crash and burn or it can choose the straight road that takes it to old age and the wrecking yard. Who gets on the long road and who takes the short cut to disaster is where my characters find themselves when they get locked up at Inner Journeys.

I've always wondered why I took my particular road and not the others that presented themselves. I'm fascinated by the choices we make in early adulthood that we don't even know are choices till we look back from a far distance. My characters are all in that early life bump Melville was in when he wrote about his experiences on the open seas as a 19- or 20-year-old sailor. There's a reason Melville didn't write about his life in his forties as a tax inspector or warehouse inspector. He revisited his moment of freedom when all possibilities seemed open to him on the open seas and the doomed story of the White Whale called to him. He lived to tell the tale during the days when he was a mortgage holder and a husband with wife and kids who depended on him and what he relived were the days when hormones ruled in his blood and he was at the strongest and fittest he would ever be.

It's a universal urge to figure out "how did I end up here" when "there" or "there" or "there" could have been one's destination. All my characters are here at the point in life when there is being chosen.

Who is standing in the way of your character achieving what she wants?

Before Old Girl came to the Inner Journeys in Idaho, her own ineptitude and inexperience get in the way of killing herself. She keeps trying and failing a multitude of times until she gets the weird conception that she'll always be trying to kill herself and never achieving it. It's like being in Purgatory when you just suffer and try and suffer and try without result.

At the treatment program, Dr. Hazey, her therapist, is one blockage. He's a smart enough therapist that he's able to ask questions of Old Girl that make her question herself. Margaret, who cares for her like she cares for all the hurt and damaged kids in treatment, also blocks her. Old Girl doesn't want to off herself, for example, when Margaret is on duty; she doesn't want Margaret to be the one to clean up the mess. Rachel tries to tether Old Girl to her by reaching out with friendship and Old Girl wants someone to be close to but she resists giving in because she knows friendship is a trap.

Leia's plan is to misbehave enough to get kicked out of treatment. Margaret is one to her and she's the one who argues to keep her even when Leia steals stuff and has sex with another therapist and is constantly causing upheaval among the staff. James won't be her fuck-buddy in the program, once he's wise to her, and then Lorenzo won't sleep with her outside the program because he's saving himself for his Mormon wife.

You-Da-Hoe tells the story of four troubled teens who get locked up in a psychiatric treatment facility in rural Idaho for doing something crazy. Old Girl keeps failing to kill herself; James, drunk and stoned on 'luuds and poppers, has run over his best friend; Leia uses sex and pathological shopping to connect; and Rachel loses a baby and can't find any part of herself.

What is the difference between garden-variety adolescent craziness and true mental breakdown? You-Da-Hoe tells the story of four troubled teens locked up at Inner Journeys, a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho where the head doctor is just as crazy as the people under lock and key and a real psychopath is loose in a garbage truck.

An exploration of the difficulties of growing up in the face of tragedy and loss,

An exploration of the fragility of sanity in the face of tragedy and loss, You-Da-Hoe tells a tragi-comic story of adolescent craziness that only make sense when you're trying to grow up and develop your own sense of self. A loner who just wants to kill herself; a stoner who can't face the fact that he ran over his best friend; a bulimic shoplifter who mistakes indiscriminate sex for connection; a star student who loses her baby and can't find herself. Everybody at Inner Journeys is struggling to survive at a treatment program where the head doctor is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there and a real psychopath circles the facility in a garbage truck.

In a braided narrative of alternating voices, four troubled teens Dr. Hazey, the drug-addicted founder of the program, and Margaret O'Leary, the voice of common sense, band together against a psychopathic garbageman named Rusty Nails, who wants to kidnap one of the girls.

071715 OG after fire with horned owl

Old Girl watched the three of them cocooned in their three way. She shivered, though she'd managed to grab a sweater and her puffy down coat over her flannel nightgown. She wondered what it would be like to be welcomed into warm arms. The scratchy closeness of Pendleton wool.

She wasn't surprised to be excluded. She'd worked hard to project the spines of a hedgehog to everybody who tried to get close. What did she care about being welcomed into stupid warm? It turned out the answer was more than she wanted to admit.

Thank God her black Snoopy hat with the long beagle ears and a pompon for a nose was stuffed in the jacket pocket. She pulled it out and inspected Snoopuy's white and black goggle eyes on either side of the pompom. What she needed to do was pull off the rolling eyeball buttons that moved when she moved and replace them with black crosses. Change the stupid dog from life and movement to road kill. Irritated, she hammed the hat on her head and moved away from the Indian blanket sandwich to stand alone.

She felt rather than heard a whoosh of powerful wings. The hat she'd just pulled down over her ears was ripped off her head. "Wha\-\--?"

A big owl materialized as a giant silhouette flying up into the top of the trees. The pink lining of Snoopy's ears flapped behind it like streamers.

She looked around, astounded. Nobody had witnessed the owl snatching her hat and her first instinct was go interrupt the blanket party. Rachel, of all people, would understand her loss But James started up in the trees and he was shouting. "Raccoon! Look! In the trees!"

No, Old Girl wanted to say. It's a great horned owl.

But by then, people from Healing House and firefighters alike were taking up the call.

"Raccoons!"

"Look at the crazy coons!"

"Neon fucking raccoons!"

The owl circled on a single silent wingbeat, Snoopy sailing behind it with its ears back and its goggle eyes spinning.

WTF.

It was all Old Girl could think to say.

But by that time everybody was looking up. More and more voices joined James in a chorus.

"A pink coon!"

"Jesus, there's a green one!"

"What in God's green earth?"

"Who turned the raccoons into Christmas lights?" That was Big Paul, stunned out of his silence into a voice of wonder.

071915 Great Horned Owl at fire

With all the lights in the yard, it was easy to see the giant owl's silhouette high atop one of the Ponderosas. The hat danged by one Snoopy ear from its talons. Yellow eyes swiveled from side to side, taking in the activity.

She touched her hand to her bare head, barely able to countenance the loss. It was Gabe's baby hat. Somebody had given it to him for a birthday present shortly because the car crash and she'd appropriated it for herself.

She felt cold with its loss. A light wind threw up snow crystals from the drifted snow in little puffs and her ears were already tingling from the cold. But it was inside where she felt almost iced over by loss. It was Gabe's hat. It was all she had.

WTF. It was the only thing Old Girl could think of to say as the big black wings sailed over the tops of the trees.

A giant pair of wings, completely silent except for a brief whoosh of wind, beat their way above the tree tops in the darkness. She thought, though she wasn't sure, that she caught one last look at the whites of Snoopy's rolling eyes before it disappeared into the night sky.

WTF. It was all Old Girl could think to say. It was completely useless against the loss.

She had an uncharacteristic impulse to wedge herself into the center of the blanket sandwich and wail at the top of her lungs. A damned owl stole my hat. It was all she had of Gabe's and yes, she knew it made her look like a dork but she couldn't live without it. Of all the losses she'd endured over the past three years, why did the loss of the stupid Snoopy hat cause her to come unraveled like the pompom on his nose that had lost so much yarn, she could barely remember when it waswhole.

Was this what life was destined to be? A series of losses followed by even more loss until she herself was naked as the day she came into this world.

Fucking owl.

Yellow eyes peered down at her unblinking. Its head swiveled from side to side as if it could see in every direction.

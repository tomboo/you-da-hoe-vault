121218 Because sex segments usage for Lydia

Like Joyce, I could throw in "because" lines in later sections of the novel. When she's walking out from Signal Point, she could think of Josh's words, "Be careful" with rueful regret. "Too late. Because everything is mixed up inside and I never learned to help myself and now I've run out of time to think about it."

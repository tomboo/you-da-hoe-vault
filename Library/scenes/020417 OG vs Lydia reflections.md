020417 OG vs Lydia

Lydia disliked Old Girl and Old Girl felt the same. If they bumped together, they sprang away from each other like magnets of opposite polarity. Old Girl thought Lydia was a selfish bitch and Lydia appeared to think the Old Girl was too good for the people around her, mistaking her feeling of being an outsider for being stuck-up.

Old Girl knew enough about herself to know that she wasn\'t stuck-up or egotistical. She definitely wasn\'t too good for other people and their sticky, tar-baby-ish connections. She had learned to be fearful and wary of getting too close like a feral cat who craves warmth and food and petting but is afraid of getting eaten if she gets too close. Lydia was the kind that pretended to be friendly but inside she had a diamond ice-crystal core than no one could touch. Fuck her all you wanted but don\'t ever try to connect with anything but what was at the surface because the deeper you went the more dangerous she was.

Old Girl had no need to pretend to be nice. She got more juice from radiating prickles like a hedgehog that was successful at protecting a soft mushy belly.

Lydia pretended all the time. She used people, got close to them in order to take from them was Old Girl\'s assessment.

Dr. Hazey asked her if it could be that they were two sides of the same coin and Old Girl wanted to hit him. Old Girl didn\'t want anybody to touch her and Lydia only wanted to be touched and fondled and she wasn\'t ready to see that both of them were using different strategies to attain the same result: distance that they both controlled obsessively.

Old Girl and Lydia rubbed each other the wrong way like two dogs fighting over the same territory.

Old

Old Girl felt herself looking at the events of Process Group like she was already gone.

She was thankful she\'d heard the last of the fucked complaining and blaming and bullshit. It was like disgesting herked up food then shitting it out with not enough nutrients for even a dog to eat.

Every time there was a newbie, it was a time of rearrangement and acting out and establishing a new pecking order. At Healing House you had to fight and claw and kick and scream to stay even or you would sink from the \"don\'t fuck with me\" group to the \"fucked.\"

MARGARET gives coffee to Rachel

The girl was practically having the DTs from caffeine withdrawal and Margaret took pity on her and gave her the latte she\'d brought in to work with her from Couer d\'Alene\'s brand-new Starbucks. Gretchen went ballistic when she saw it. Jesus, it was a cup of coffee, \"Margaret told her. \"It's not heroin.\"

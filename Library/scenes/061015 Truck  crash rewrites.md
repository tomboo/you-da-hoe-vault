061015 Truck crash rewrites

A horrific bang followed by a moment of silence. Then a whumpf and a secondary explosion of snow and ice and branches and needles that reached as far as the dip in the road where she lay.

A horrific bang. Then a slow, creak-cracking whumph that splintered snow and ice shards and needles and branches as far as the dip in the street where she lay.

She scrambled up on her feet and watched what seemed to be a tree falling in slow motion over a truck that was standing up vertically on its end, as if it were trying to drive up the trunk to the sky. For one impossible moment, the chassis balanced, then creaked and fell around a slender cracked pine to its side.

When it flew off the curve before the dip, by some miracle, the truck had missed a massive line of Ponderosa pines. Its front end clipped a skinny lodge pole sapling on the edge of the grove. This was what gave Old Girl hope---she was already gathering speed in a wild climb up and over the snow berm to get to the passenger side of the truck\--it was such a skinny tree. Not even half the diameter of a telephone pole. Its trunk had cracked at the point of impact. That was why it was leaning like it was drunk over the truck now on its side, its top branches folded almost to the roadway. Surely anyone in the truck could have survived the crash into such an underfed, sickly tree.

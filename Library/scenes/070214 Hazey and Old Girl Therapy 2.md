070214 Hazey and Old Girl Therapy 2

A thought about Hazey flitted through Old Girl's mind as she marched up the trail. Something he'd said in one of their silent sessions when she was disinclined to talk. He'd let her lie on his couch and map the veins behind her eyelids. It beat listening to more stupid psychobabble that ran over and around her all day like a river of shit.

Hazey rarely tried to fill the silence between them, which she appreciated more than he probably knew.

He'd commented, apropos of nothing, "It's been said that a death wish might be generated before a child has the language to deal with parental anxiety."

He didn't explain. He just let the thought hang there in the silent, dust-moted air of his wood paneled office. It floated above his neat and paperless desk above a leather cup full of very sharp pencils. She'd never seen him write with the pencils. Only a fountain pen, when he'd take an occasional note from a phone call, but he never wrote when they were in session.

"Parental anxiety? You mean... like what\...? Stress?"

"Could be. Or illness? Perhaps someone in the immediate family was dying. Or financial difficulties. Everyone has those." Hazey paused, opening the tent of his hands and then shooing them inwards, as if encouraging his thoughts to form words. "Perhaps there was difficulty between the couple. Or just difficulty in general, for example, when the parents are too young for parenthood."

It was true that Old Girl's mom and dad were not much older than she was now when they get married. But she had no recollection of "difficulties." Sure, money was tight. Her dad worked a lot and travelled for a field sales job with Detroit Diesel. Mom ran the little ship with Old Girl, and later Gabe, in the back and Mom at the helm till Dad came home and then it wasn't a rowboat any more, just a house boat floating on a current of calm.

"Making any friends now that you've graduated to Young Adults?" Hazey asked her some time later.

Old Girl had moved from Adolescents (ages 13- to 16-years-old) on her birthday without a backwards glance. The feral group of 17- to 19-year-olds she was a part of now had the title of Young Adults without the sense.

"Not if I can help it," she said. The grandfather clock ticked one infinitesimal tock forward and she had the horrible thought that she'd be stuck on this couch her entire life if she didn't find a way to escape.

"Maybe we should stop an wait for the others." Rachel's voice broke her concentration. She stood a few feet up the trail speaking to James.

Old Girl blinked. She'd been on the couch with Dr. Hazey behind her and then she rejoined her body on a trail that was shadowed by immense Ponderosa pines with elegant long needles sagging with snow.

She shook off thoughts about the never-ending therapy that always seemed to go in a circle. Death wish. Was that what she had?

She skirted around James and Rachel and picked up the pace, though the trail climbed sharply into uneven cloud cover. Even before Mom and Dad and Gabe got smeared by the senior citizen who was almost legally blind, she'd wanted to end herself.

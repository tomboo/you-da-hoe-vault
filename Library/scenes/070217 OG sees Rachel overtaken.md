070217 OG sees Rachel\'s body overtaken

The girl\'s body seemed to be of her and against her at the same time.

Old Girl had never seen someone taken over by her own body and abused by it. In an odd flash of memory, she heard her mother, pregnant with Gabe, say, \"This kid will be the death of me.\" What had Gabe been doing? Kicking her, maybe? She remembered the strange alien feel of her mother\'s tight-as-a-drum belly. There was a weird alien inside Mom, knocking as if to be let out. Whoever the alien was in Rachel jerked at her arms and clacked her teeth together and beat her heels against the floor while James held onto her shins with white-knuckled hands.

By the time they got everybody loaded in the van, it was past noon. People were already whining about lunch, so Josh broke out the PB&J and juice boxes Gretchen had packed in a cooler and they complained about how bad the food was until it was all gone. When they got to the turn-off to Highway 95 Bruce and Darlene passed them on their way back from taking Rachel to the Emergency Room, so Josh stopped and after some back-and-forth, Darlene decided Rachel was well enough to hike with the group as long as Josh made sure she \"didn\'t get over excited.\"

Really, this was a function of Darlene not wanting to get stuck babysitting Rachel who wasn\'t on her case load. That negotiation took another ten minutes so it was past one by the time they were on their way to Two Mouth Lake.

Rachel got assigned to the front seat, riding shot gun with James, while Lydia got demoted back to Barf Land with Old Girl.

\"Sure you\'re OK to hike? \" James asked Rachel.

\"Sure.\" Rachel ducked her head in embarrassment. \"The doc asked me if I was on DepaKote. I said yeah. He said, \"Good to go.\"

\"That\'s Idaho for you,\" James said.

\"What do you mean?\'

\"Nobody has health insurance here so the hospital just want to get rid of people as fast as they can.\"

\"The doc was Indian. India Indian. He was wearing a turban.\"

\"A Sikh, probably,\" James said. \"Nobody else will be here voluntarily.\"

\"Like you?\" Rachel asked.

\"Like us,\" James said.

Lydia bared her perfect orthodontic teeth at this exchange now that she was sentenced to Barf Land.

The week before, Old Girl got stuck sitting next to Lydia who talked nonstop about all the hooking she was doing. \"You don\'t need cash around here as long as you have these.\" She pointed to her chiseled lips, glossed with a wet sheen. \"Blow jobs are the same as cash in Youdaho.\"

Old Girl asked her if she wasn\'t afraid she\'d get some disease. Lydia rolled her eyes. \"I make them use condoms.\"

\"In your mouth? How does that work?\"\
Lydia turned her back on her and sniffed.

Good, Old Girl thought, score one for the horse I rode in on. Which reminded her, why didn\'t she see anybody riding horses in Youdaho? It was a mystery. She saw stables and a few corrals, a field or two with herd of mares or once, a stallion out grazing. Another time when Margaret was driving into town, she had pointed out a hinny and explained how it was different from a mule, saying \"Same idea, different cross.\" But really horses and people on saddles who rode them were in short supply in a place where you\'d expect been herds and herds of them.

Margaret had to explain this too. \"Insurance is high. One of you chuckle-heads might fall on your head and Dr. Hazey doesn\'t want to pay the premiums.

Another examples of the Catch 22 of Youdaho. The place where horses were promised in the brochure and you were never going to get near one.

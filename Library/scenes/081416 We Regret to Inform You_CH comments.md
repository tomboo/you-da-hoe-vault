**We Regret to Inform You**

Wendy Call \~ <wlc@wendycall.com> \~ 206.354.1102

I had always imagined that truly bad medical news was delivered in paneled offices, the physician sitting at a wide polished desk, gazing sympathetically across piles of manila folders at the unfortunate recipients of the nightmare. I had imagined the patient's family might be offered cups of tea or glasses of water; there would be some element of formality, some acknowledgment of the moment's import. The few times I had heard friends recount such moments, I remembered the setting as "in the doctor's office." Or perhaps I simply inserted that detail into a faulty mental recording of their heartbreaking stories.

My mother, father, and I arrived at the hospital early for the 10:00 am appointment, but weren't ushered into the examination room until an hour after our appointment time. My parents took the two chairs by the short countertop and I squatted on the doctor's stool, idly spinning myself back and forth. I assumed we were simply waiting for our allotted minutes in Dr. Cleary's office and the intake nurse had decided to give us a private place to wait.

None of us had met Dr. Cleary; we knew only that he was the surgeon who could do something about my mother's advanced cancer---discovered just a week earlier---if it was that something could be done.

Settled in our seats, the three of us looked at the only other piece of furniture in the small room: the examination table. It was heavy, burnished oak, nicked and scratched from many decades of nurses snipping pap smear samples and running swabs over strep-coated throats. It seemed transported from another time, an anomaly in the spotless, nouveau-featureless space. "I've not seen an examination table like that since, well, since I was in medical school," my father said. Dad had attended two years of medical school on the way to a doctorate in anatomy. As a result, he had an excellent understanding of medical conditions and a weaker understanding of medical practices.

We fell silent. The anxiety and boredom of our wait expanded and filled the white-walled box, spilling over the *People* magazine about Christopher Reeves' wife "succumbing to breast cancer" (*What will happen to their thirteen-year-old son?*) and the green flyer asking, "Do you have kidney disease?" (*Speak with your doctor!*) At 11:40 a.m., there was a short rap at the door and a woman entered our box. Dr. Melissa Poh was far younger than I was, violating my illogical criterion for whether a doctor could be trusted. I stood to shake her hand. "I'm Wendy Call, Marilyn's daughter." She nodded and sat on the stool I had just vacated.

Dr. Poh introduced herself to my parents, emphasizing the word *doctor*. My mother smiled broadly and my father nodded, his upper lip quivering. She swiveled her stool back to the counter, turning her back to me, and began to draw a picture on a blank sheet of paper. I hopped onto the high examination bench. There was no other place for me to sit.

My parents and I glanced back and forth from one another to Dr. Poh's pen, wondering at her silence. Her drawing took shape; it was far better than the other two drawings that had been done for my mother during twenty days of doctor's appointments, hospital stays, MRIs and endoscopies. A round-cornered, isosceles triangle: liver. A curling snake: stomach, duodenum, small bowel. A leaf nestled between the upper and lower curls of the snake: pancreas. A tiny bag between pancreas and liver: gall bladder. Tree branches inside the triangle: liver ducts.

She swiveled toward my parents and began to speak. I moved back and forth between the examination bench and the floor, so that I could see her drawing as she narrated it. I knew I was making the awkward situation worse by bouncing between the floor and the high bench, but I couldn't figure out what else to do.

I focused on Dr. Poh's cartoon. Two circles on the liver: metastatic pancreatic cancer. She covered the circles on her cartoon liver with one hand. "If these weren't there, you would be in a different category." With that sleight of hand, she wiped away my mother's future. For a second, the entire room bleached colorless.

A dainty three-ring binder lay open on my mother's knees. *Because cancer has spread to liver -- [no surgery]{.underline} can help the cancer*, Mom wrote in her artist's script*.* My father's breathing became a rasp. Dr. Poh finished her explanation, stood, and said she was going to confer with Dr. Cleary.

"OK," my mother said.

My father sighed loudly.

Dr. Poh stole a quick glance at me and walked out the door, leaving my mother's medical file and the drawing on the counter.

My father's knees began bobbing; his whole body trembled. My mother pulled the last Kim-wipe out of a slim box. She shook the tiny square of tissue and took another Kim-wipe box from a tall stack on the counter. My father clawed at the handkerchief in his back pocket. I stood next to him, rubbing his back, steadying him in the chair. He leaned into my chest and shuddered, moaning loudly. The room was too small for my father's expanding agony.

"Why does this have to happen to *us*?" my father said. "There are so many ... people in the world."

His voice cracked and I missed the word before "people." Other? Bad? Evil?

"Now, we don't get to choose." My mother's voice held a note of reproach. Canny and practical to her German-Lutheran Midwestern core, Mom had never suffered the delusion that bad things only happened to other people.

Half an hour plodded by, punctuated by my father's shuddering sighs and moans. I wondered what Dr. Poh might be conferring about, with my mother's entire record still sitting on the counter before us. Should I go look for Dr. Cleary? Should I request a tranquilizer for my father?

Nearly two-and-a-half hours after our appointment time, Dr. Cleary stepped into the room, Dr. Poh trailing him. He took the empty stool and she leaned against the sink. I finally understood: we were simply a practice run for a newly minted doctor learning how to tell people they would soon die. I stared at Dr. Poh; she avoided my white-hot gaze.

Dr. Clearly introduced himself and asked my mother, "So, are you retired?" I tried to imagine how that might be relevant.

Mom told him she used to be a schoolteacher.

"Around here?"

"All over. Doug was in the military." She didn't name the places she had worked as a teacher: Indiana, Kentucky, California, Maryland.

"Were you ever stationed around southern California?" He picked the location out of the ether.

"Yes, Miramar," my mother replied. We talked about the beach and the swimming and then my mother mentioned she had also worked inland, in El Centro. Dr. Cleary found this now-pointless detail incredible: *he* had grown up on a ranch near El Centro. His aunt had been a teacher in Holtville. "Perhaps you knew her?"

I squirmed on the examination bench, the white paper under me crinkling loudly.

Dr. Cleary stopped talking about his childhood. "I need a few minutes to review your chart."

The five of us fell silent as he flipped through the many pages, pausing at some, glancing quickly through others. The bald spot on his head reddened. My mother smiled at me and patted my father's trembling knee. Dr. Poh leaned harder against the sink. I considered asking her to find me a chair. Dr. Cleary closed the thick file and asked my mother the same medical-history questions she had been asked many times in the previous twenty days, the answers long since recorded in the file he had just studied.

He pulled out a blank piece of paper.

I handed him Dr. Poh's cartoon. "We already have three drawings. You can use the last one, if you like." He accepted the sheet of paper, startled, then glanced at Dr. Poh. "This is a *very* good drawing."

Dr. Cleary asked my mother about cancer in her family. "None," she said, with a shrug. "In my family we do heart attacks and strokes, not cancer." Her tone was friendly. My anger began to compete with my father's agony for airspace in the small room.

Dr. Cleary wrote a list of "if-thens" under Dr. Poh's isosceles liver. "Thens" included curative surgery, chemotherapy, curative radiation, and palliative radiation. When he arrived at my mother's particular "if"---metastatic pancreatic cancer with duodenal intrusion---there was no "then."

He paused. "I'm sure you have been Googling and reading."

My mother shook her head, no longer smiling. "My husband works in the medical field so we have books." Later, she would tell me that the book she had consulted contained only a few vague paragraphs on pancreatic cancer.

Dr. Cleary described my mother's hopeless situation as if he were telling us something we already knew. I suppose, in broad terms, we did. Yet we didn't. Through twenty days of piecemeal bad news, we had repeated to ourselves: *surely, there must be something.*

There was not. My mother wrote down in her three-ring binder, her hand steady: "Prognosis -- no cure -- no remission -- 4-6 months to a few years."

"You don't look like you are going anywhere anytime soon," Dr. Cleary said, trying for a hearty tone. "You look robust." My mother copied down his words, ROBUST all in capital letters.

His explanation came around to its inevitable conclusion: there was nothing he could do for my mother. He apologized, said goodbye, and left the room. Dr. Poh followed him, nodding to each of us.

There was so little ceremony to their departure, I assumed our appointment was not yet over. Perhaps a social worker or therapist would come to see us. Or a nurse would tap on the door to ask whether we needed anything. My father began to cry; his sobs growing louder and louder. Worried that he needed a sedative, I stepped out into the hallway to seek help. The nurse who had shown us to the room more than an hour earlier was standing near our doorway staring at a computer screen. "Is someone else coming to see us?" I asked her, my father's wails rising behind me.

"Oh, no," she waved her hand casually. "Just leave your appointment sheet at the front desk. You're all done."

Not knowing what else to do, we followed her directions. My father and I waited in the hallway while Mom went to the bathroom. A sob shuddered in Dad's chest. He turned to me and asked, "What are we going to do?" His voice was a squeak.

"Whatever Mom wants," I answered, my voice flat.

∞ ∞ ∞ ∞

I was three thousand miles away from my home in Seattle, and eight hundred miles from my parents' home in North Carolina, at my graduate school program in Vermont, the day that Mom had first heard back about the test results: the summer solstice. I don't remember whether I cried after she told me that the doctors' worst fears had been confirmed. Shortly after the phone call, I had an appointment with my thesis advisor.

I sat across the table from him, filled lunch trays between us. It was a perfect southern Vermont summer day, but inside my head it was pouring black sleet. I wasn't living in my body at that moment. My mother's body had betrayed us; how could I trust my own?

I needed to explain myself to this man who cared nothing for me, but with whom I had to work very closely for the next six months. "My life is about to get very complicated. My mother has just been diagnosed with cancer."

He blew cigarette smoke into the summer air. I smelled nothing. "What kind?" He stared past me, over my head at the line of tables behind me. Chair legs scraped the deck's wooden slats. Laughter clanked around us and people lived their oblivious lives.

"Pancreatic."

In the years since this conversation, whenever I think of it, my mind comes to rest on this particular moment. Even as it was happening---in this pause between my single word and my advisor's response, I could sense that the moment was filled with something deeply important. For a long time I could not identify it. Now I can: it was the privilege of optimism. The final moment of it.

He exhaled deeply, still looking over the top of my head. "That's bad." He paused. "You know that's bad, right?" My ignorance caught in his dropped gaze, as he saw the question in my eyes.

Did I eat? I can't imagine that I did. I can't remember anything else about the meal. My notebook tells me that I continued dutifully on with the activities of the day: a lecture by author Barry Hannah, titled "Military History as Regards Fiction: The Unquenchable Thirst for World War II." Mr. Hannah seemed arrogant, brimming with braggadocio. Military history in general and World War II in particular have never been of much interest to me. My notes have little to do with the subject of the lecture; containing disconnected lines: "I read only poetry and history when I'm writing." "Having cancer in America is a good career move." I remember the moment after I scribbled that last line: I snapped my notebook shut, stumbled up the stairs of the dark auditorium, and burst out into the cruel sunshine, on the longest day of the year.

The next two lines in my notebook:

*4% five-year survival rate*

*median life span from diagnosis is six months*

Before I wrote those two statistics, I stared my computer screen, then folded over my bed. No. No no no no. No's echoed in my head as I wrote those phrases in my journal and called Aram. As I washed my face and went back to class. As I went out to dinner with my advisor and three other graduate students and halfway through his third martini he pointed at me and said, "The green light for shit just went on for you." (I only nodded. By then, I knew.) As I boarded a plane to Raleigh, North Carolina. As I waited out a vicious thunderstorm in an airport hotel, my connecting flight cancelled. My mind careened away, over and over again, from the subject---both close at hand and out of reach---and back, relentlessly. Thoughts that passed through my mind:

About my family: *Don't cry. At least not in front of Mom.*

About people in my graduate school seminar, about people in line at Dulles airport, about nearly everyone around me: *"Stop fucking whining!"*

Myself: *Now I'm really going to get gray hair.*

My job: *How am I going to explain this to my boss?*

My friends: *I guess I have to pretend to care about my best friend's new baby.*

My future: *What am I going to do with all of Mom's crap?*

My selfishness: *Why does it have to be my mother, who helps us, rather than Aram's mother, who only makes demands?*

Most of all, I wondered how I would face all that had to be faced.

Sitting in the Dulles airport, thirty hours into a thirty-six hour trip, I picked up a discarded *USA Today* and read this poll question:

Minorities that you would *least* want your children to marry:

1\. Atheist

2\. Muslim

About that, I thought: *My mother got both and welcomed Aram.*

After our appointment with Dr. Poh, Dr. Cleary, and Dr. Poh's death-drawing, my mother insisted that we go out to lunch. My father insisted on driving, though his hands shook terribly and his chest still shuddered with waning sobs. At the Café Pahlaveh, I carefully thought through Mom's new dietary restrictions. What isn't heavy meat? (She couldn't digest it.) What isn't spicy? (Her stomach had become delicate, but that was OK, because all of Persian cuisine includes only one spicy dish.) What isn't too acid? (This was harder; Persians love their lemons and tomatoes.) It was a game to occupy my mind, and it worked. I ordered bademjun for myself---red meat in a piquant, lemon-tomato sauce, everything my mother couldn't eat---and the waitress asked if I was Iranian. We laughed out loud.

How is it possible that we laughed? Later my father would refer to this day as the "the worst day of our lives so far."

When my father went to the bathroom, Mom leaned forward to tell me that she just wanted him to see that he had life beyond *her* life. "He probably has a lot of good years left," she said.

My father had two older brothers who lived into their eighties. "Like Uncle Jerry," I said, referring to one of them, whose wife had died a decade earlier of cancer. Mom recoiled. "*He* had a girlfriend *two months later*! Doug better not do that." She settled back into her chair. "Well, of course, it's OK, but wait more than two months." She thought for a moment. "I think four months would be good."

The calendar hung in the air between us. "I just don't know what I'm supposed to be doing," she said.

About what? I thought. Dad? Your will? I didn't know what to tell her. "Whatever you want," I thought, but did not say. It seemed to me the obvious answer, but also somehow callous, or flip.

Mom went on. "Should I be organizing my fabric and my sewing room?"

In the following months, my mother would do a lot. Teach my sister-in-law to make her special pralines and peach jam. Visit Seattle and see the Pacific Ocean one more time. Ask friends to come visit---some of them would. Give away her favorite necklaces, dulcimer, and quilting chest. Finish piecing several quilts, including a thousand-piece charm quilt for me.

On the way home in the car, Mom mentioned her living will. Should she review it? Update it? Revise it? Afraid to look at my father, I kept my eyes on the window. "You and Dad have led pretty organized lives," I said, because I couldn't think of anything else to say. I was trying to be reassuring, but sounded only dismissive.

I thought back to a discussion I'd had with my brother in late 2001. I'd been living outside the country at that time and he'd come to visit---the only time I'd see him in two years. One night, he told me over carnitas and nopal tacos, that whenever the time came and Mom and Dad needed help, he couldn't do it on his own. Earlier that year, Mom had undergone major surgery; I was so far away I had known of the event only through emails. I nodded and sat up straighter as he spoke; I knew it was important. I wouldn't have imagined that "when the time came" would be in less than five years.

The morning after we received Dr. Poh's death-drawing, I flew home to Seattle to quit my job, pack my bags, and return to North Carolina, indefinitely. Saying goodbye at my parents' front door, my father enclosed me in a long hug. When I tried to step away, he clung to me. I paused a few moments, then pulled away. My brother stood by the door, holding my suitcase. Dad's raised hands curled into half-fists, bending at the wrists. He leaned his head back and howled. I had never before seen such piercing emotional pain at such close range. Mom steadied Dad, patting his shoulders. She nodded toward my brother and me, her voice reassuring. "You go on. He'll be OK."

Life goes on. Except when it doesn't.

I gathered data on metastatic pancreatic cancer: suggested diet, typical results of various treatment regimens, and symptoms of disease progression. My mother told me she didn't want "any bad news that wasn't essential." I was impressed by Mom's self-control; she had never been plagued by the uncontrollable curiosity that had always been my nature. I was happy to serve has her filter, but it was an exhausting role.

When I look back at the letters that I wrote to friends, letting them know about my mother's terminal cancer, I'm horrified by their bluntness. The day of my mother's phone call to Vermont, I wrote to one of my dearest friends, with no preamble: "My mom has pancreatic cancer. That's all I learned from talking on the phone with my mom, but based on what I read online last night, for most people, this is a death sentence." This, to a friend who had known my mother for fifteen years and spent several Christmases with my family in North Carolina.

Dr. Poe and Dr. Cleary did help us recalibrate our measures for "bad news" and "good news." In mid-August, radiology scans indicated that the tumor had grown to block Mom's small intestine. The cancer was growing rapidly, but there was a short-term---as in, perhaps three months---solution to the intestinal blockage. Three months had become as far into the future as I could bear to look. When I wrote to Aram with the news, my tone was upbeat enough that he had to clarify, "This could be pretty bad news, right?"

∞ ∞ ∞ ∞

I came to despise meetings with my mother's oncologist, Dr. Johanna Bendell. After Mom declined chemotherapy, Dr. Bendell often stood, arms crossed in front of her, during our appointments. Mom and I had to crane our necks up to meet her eyes---she was a tall woman who wore very high heels---though she was often looking past us. Mom and I decided that she would take notes and I would talk during these appointments, as Dr. Bendell moved so quickly it was hard to keep up.

Once surgery was eliminated as an option, she enrolled my mother in "palliative chemotherapy," a term that struck me, cancer newbie that I was, as an oxymoron. This was the equation:

Four to six months life expectancy,

plus gemcitabine-tarceva chemo drip (which added four days each week of fatigue and vomiting)

equaled six to eight months life expectancy

Dr. Bendell seemed to consider that a sound equation. I decided that she must have been one of those college students who had mastered biology without ever mastering mathematics. As an undergraduate biology major, I had been one, too. My mother had been a middle-school math teacher. She knew better.

In late August, we had an appointment with Dr. Bendell that began differently: she asked us to sit down, looked my mother straight in the eye, smiled, and let us finish our sentences. She answered questions---some of which we'd posed several times on previous visits, with no response---and offered a few useful statistics. Ten to twenty percent of her patients elected, like my mother, not to do treatment, she explained, adding quickly, "That includes those who are too sick to do it." Meaning, not only that---like my mother---they would surely die anyway, but because their bodies were simply too cancer-ravaged to survive chemotherapy's side effects. The subject of the oncology unit's Cancer Support Group, which Mom and I had attended weekly since learning of it by chance, came up. "The group is for people who are pursuing treatment vigorously," Dr. Bendell said, emphasizing the last word. In other words, the group wasn't intended for quitters like my mother. For a panicked moment, I worried that she was telling us we couldn't attend the group, which had become my favorite hour of the week. It was our only support. I had tried visiting Cornucopia, a local nonprofit that supported cancer patients and their families. The volunteer's friendliness had turned to ice when she learned my mother was not in treatment. "You can't just give up!" she had told me. I had left Cornucopia's office quietly and apologetically, wishing I had the nerve to scream at her the question that raged in my head: *Half a million people will die of cancer in this country this year! Are they all just giving up?*

But no, Dr. Bendell wasn't uninviting us to the support group. She simply wanted our permission to release Mom to hospice care. When I realized the reason for her patience and consistent eye contact, I almost laughed. We had asked Dr. Bendell about hospice care at previous meetings, but she had never replied. She had ignored our questions so successfully she'd forgotten them. Or perhaps she had never even heard us.

On my mother's bedroom shelves, she kept her most cherished things. At least one object from these shelves now sits in each room of my house. A blue glass owl paperweight on my kitchen shelves. A small brass bell in the dining room. A Depression-glass bowl in the living room. An old medicine bottle in the bathroom. And on my desk, a toy Chinese lantern. That last object is not at all beautiful---not even my mother would have argued that it was---made of black plastic and once-red fabric dulled to salmon, the images of a long-ago, imagined life in China so faded they are barely discernable. It stands lopsided because of one broken leg. It was the only broken thing I ever saw in my mother's house. She and Dad were extremely careful; anything broken by someone else (most often, me) was quietly discarded.

The toy lantern had come from a 1970s trip to San Francisco's Chinatown, when my family had met my mother's pen pal, Cheryl Oda. My mother and Cheryl had begun writing to one another when they were both in the fourth grade, ten years old, and continued for more than half a century. The correspondence stopped only when my mother became ill. Cheryl was from Hawaii; she and Mom met in person while she was living in the Bay Area.

After the longest correspondence of her life, one of the only letters my mother failed to write about her illness was to Cheryl Oda. Mom had been planning the trip to Hawaii, to visit Cheryl, at the time of her diagnosis. In the months that followed, our family went back and forth about whether the trip would happen. My mother kept putting if off and I kept nudging. Gently at first, then not so gently. Her doctors said she was strong enough to make the trip and I wanted her to have that last vacation. My father nudged her, too. Finally, my mother decided. No. She did not feel well enough to make the long trip to Hawaii. Mom had always been a careful correspondent, but she kept putting off an explanatory letter to her pen pal of 53 years. I don't know how, or even whether, Cheryl Oda finally learned of my mother's death. That unwritten letter still haunts me. The cruelest way to inform someone is to fail to do so.

How do we write goodbye letters? And what should others write in reply? The only options we're given are "get well soon" or "in sympathy."

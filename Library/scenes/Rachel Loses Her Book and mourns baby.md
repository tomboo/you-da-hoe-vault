IF RACHEL HURRIED, SHE COULD meet with Dr. Lengel and pick up another copy of *Huck Finn* at the bookstore before she had to meet the pick-up van. Some ass hole had stolen her*s*.

A steady slippage of deodorants, shampoo, hair bands, barrettes, lip stick and even underwear had been going MIA with the regularity of a metronome at Healing House.

Rachel had wanted to wear her cashmere sweater that morning, a birthday present from Gran. It was one of the few times the old crotchety woman had given her a present that she could actually use. Gran, a seventy-year-old with the energy of a coiled spring, haunted garage sales (her idea of entertainment) and was always giving Rachel an endless series of antique teacups. All with a story of their maker and age and how valuable they were. Gran knew because "she looked it up in the book," an ancient dog-eared Bible of antique china that she always carried with her in an enormous alligator purse, another garage sale find.

*Miss Lucy had a baby. His name was Tiny Tim.*

*She put him in the bathtub. To see if he could swim.*

*He drank up all the water. He ate up all the soap.*

*He tried to eat the bathtub, But it wouldn\'t go down his throat.*

*Miss Lucy called the doctor. Miss Lucy called the nurse.*

*Miss Lucy called the lady With the alligator purse.*

Gran's old tote was big enough to stick Tiny Tim and the bathtub in it. That's what had happened after Rachel gave birth. A nurse had laid the tiny red wrinkly boy on her chest after 28 hours of hard labor and she dozed off feeling his scrawny bird weight and when she opened her eyes, he had flown.

Could you *lose* a baby? Apparently. Technically, Gran and Mom spirited him away from Rachel "for her own good" because she was only 16 and "couldn't take care of him." She always thought of the tiny boy as lost, as in "I've misplaced him" which gave her the feeling that if ever a miracle happened, he could be found again.

Originally they had agreed to let her keep him. That's what Rachel and Randy, her boyfriend, wanted. But Dad and Gran and Mom all ganged up on her in her last month of pregnancy.

"You're too young."

> "Randy's not committed."
>
> "Neither of you are ready for the responsibility."
>
> "It'll ruin your life before it's even started."

They were right about that part. St. Edwards High tossed her out because the Catholics didn't want a bad apple becoming a watermelon in their midst. Randy got cold feet brought on by a baseball scholarship to the University of Texas.

Then they made her switch schools and all her friends disappeared. At the alternative school they made her attend, she walked around alone morphing into a heftier and heavier ghost.

Everybody---her brother, all her aunts and uncles, the extended family of cousins stopped talking to her as if pregnancy was some kind of plague. Then, as if all that was only a preamble to hell, Gran and Mom sat her down in the last month of her pregnancy to tell her they wouldn't lift a finger to help her if she kept him. Out on the street at sixteen with no job skills, no degree, and no money to buy diapers or baby food. You'll both starve, they said.

There were worse things than starving, Rachel found out. After having the baby, she went down a rabbit hole but unlike Alice, she never came out of it. All she did was tumble farther, faster, deeper into darkness. The only thing that brought her toward the light where she could feel something \--and that was merely temporary -- was cutting.

*\"Mumps, said the doctor. Measles, said the nurse.*

*Razor, said the lady With the alligator purse.*

For months, she brought back the birth pangs by slicing her armpits and the bottoms of

her feet and the insides of her thighs with a salted razor. Until one day, a month ago, she couldn't stop and she opened the arteries of both wrists down to bone.

Welcome to Healing House.

*Out went the doctor. Out went the nurse.*

*Out went the lady With the alligator purse.*

SEVEN

OLD GIRL WAS PISSED that they'd moved Rachel's stuff into her room.

They brought the girl back from her trip to the Emergency Room right before Med Check. Old Girl made a point of looking absorbed in reading *Stranger in a Strange Land* in case the new girl wanted to get chatty. Rachel unpacked two huge suitcases while Old Girl wondered if she'd think it was weird that her side of the room looked like no one lived there. The shared closet was almost bare with the exception of one jacket and some tee shirts she didn't want.

Rachel laid out a quilt and two matching pillows along with sheets that she'd brought from home. It was a crazy quilt of velvet and polka dots and purple and orange spangled fabric that somehow all worked together though none of it matched. A photo of herself with a girl who looked like a sister and two adults on a beach in Mexico, all wearing stupid sombreros, went on the bed side table. Next came a photo of the same adults in a Range Rover parked near a herd of zebras.

By the time she finished unpacking, she was out of hangers. Then the bell for 8:00 Med Check rang.

Old Girl showed her where the Drug Room was off the kitchen. The beefy nurse, Gloria, was counting out pills into multiple rows of plastic cups. Gretchen, the dietician, was counting out pills and checking the contents of the little cups against a clipboard.

"Did the Emergency Room check you out?" Gloria asked Rachel. Rachel rolled her eyes and said that the podunk Emergency Room of the podunk Kootenai Hospital gave her the standard podunk medical response: "Epilepsy? You're on Depakote?" A Sikh doctor in turban and clogs peered under her eyelids and told her she was good to go.

Old Girl had gotten good at reading upside down in the early stages of her psychiatric education. Gretchen prepped a pill cup for Rachel that held almost as many pills as Old Girl's what with her epilepsy drugs plus anti-anxiety this, anti-depressant-that. Our cups overfloweth, she thought, reading the long list of meds on Rachel Cathcart's chart.

"Who's Angela Livengood?" Rachel turned to Old Girl with a perplexed look. "I haven't met her yet."

Old Girl arched an eyebrow. "You don't want to. She's a bitch."

Rachel said Inner Horizons seemed to have a lot of bitches. One had already rifled her suitcase and stolen her new, never-worn Lulu Lemon pants before she even had a chance to unpack. "What's so bad about Angela?"

Old Girl held a gingery dread lock in front of her eyes, making her look both demented and purposeful. "For one thing, she'll rip your ears off if you call her Angela."

"Why?"

"It pisses her off. It's a stupid name."

"It's not. It's just old fashioned," said Rachel, scrutinizing all the Healing Housers who were forming up in a straggling line for their daily cocktail of drugs. "What does she look like?"

"Like me."

Old Girl tightened the scrunchy that collected her dreads in a spray of ginger-brown stalks. She was trying for a fountain of cattails on the top of her head.

"I haven't seen anybody else with dreads here. Who's she rooming with?"

Old Girl yawned. "You."

"You're up, Oldster," Gretchen called out and 0ld Girl obediently took the little glass of water held out to her. She threw back a dozen or so pills in a practiced swallow. Then Old Girl opened up her mouth and let Gretchen swab around her mouth, under her tongue, between her cheek and her gums. She leaned backwards to let Gretchen peer, like a spelunker, into the cave of her mouth.

"How's it going with Abilify?" Gretchen asked. "It's the end of week three."

Old Girl raised one shoulder to her ear, like the hunchback of Notre Dame, and she dragged one leg in a halting step toward the door. "I'm cured! Am I good to go?"

Rachel waggled her fingers good-bye to Old Girl, Tweety-Bird style. She called after her. "That Angela bitch could be wrong. I'm taking Ability and it got better for me."

"As long as you don't call her Angela," Old Girl said, "That's all the better it's going to get."

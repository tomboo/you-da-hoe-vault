020719 Big Paul Intrudes on Apology Between Reza and James

It was like watching a marigold bloom. Reza's saffron-brown skin glowed. His dark brown eyes had the intense light of concentration. All his usually nervous movements were silenced in his concentration on the task of juggling. Reza, for once, didn't seem annoying. He seemed interested and interesting. Hard working. Invested in learning and acquiring a skill.

James cheered him on, saying, "You're getting it."

When Reza was able to keep two potatoes aloft for a long minute, even James applauded. Caught up by Reza's joy in his own accomplishment.

Lorenza, so big and stolid of body, was a good teacher. Clear. Patient. He could see when Reza had a good toss. He broke down the steps of juggling---the toss, the loft and the release---with precision. James could see the younger boy leaning into the older boy's solidity and skill and reassurance. When Lorenzo praised Reza, he flushed with shy pride. James had a momentary flash of his father walking along next to him on his first bike ride, steadying him with his big hand, then steadying him with his big voice as he pedaled away on his own. "You're getting it, you're getting it," he heard Dad says and was surprised to hear the same words coming out of his mouth.

James already knew how to juggle. He wasn't great, but he could keep three balls in the air if he worked on it. He thought he might be able to master four with practice.

"I didn't know you could juggle," Reza said in the van.

"It didn't come up."

"I've been trying to learn that trick for months. So how come it came up with Lorenzo and we don't even know that guy?"\
James was hard pressed for an answer. He hadn't thought about Reza's juggling. It hadn't occurred to him to pass along his knowledge. It wasn't a priority. And yet.

Reza had been so thrilled. Flushed and blooming like a marigold in the sun of Lorenzo's regard. He felt a little crappy. Why hadn't he taught Reza the rudiments of juggling when he saw him struggling. Reza had dropped spuds all over week after week.

Selfish. The word flitted into his consciousness and shocked him with its truth. Jesus, James, how about thinking about somebody besides yourself?

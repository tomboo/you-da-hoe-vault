5/31/14 Kitchen setting

Stop and start. [Stutter]{.underline} flight like a bird shocked out of a bush by a noise. It wings away in flight with tight claps of its feathers to its body in a syncopated stroke-stroke-stroke and-glide.

[Setting:]{.underline}

The kitchen always had an astringent smell like raw vinegar splashed over a salad to blast your taste buds.

The Healing House kitchen looked like a normal family kitchen--oak cabinets, a teddy bear canister on the counter that promised cookies but never delivered. It smelled astringent like the salad dressings Gretchen favored that had too much vinegar and not enough oil.

The living area looked like someone had a couch fetish. The program was big on group \"processing\" (a euphemism for \"cluster fuck\") and everybody had to sit in a healing circle and everybody hated the straight backed dining chairs so fights had been so fierce, they solved the issue with multiple couches that they shoved into lopsided hexagrams for healing.

Healing House looked like a ranch house if you put a ranch house on steroids. It was all one story--OG assumed it was to prevent people from jumping--and it had two long wings which angled away from the common living area. Each wing held six double bedrooms and the girls were forbidden to enter the boy\'s wing and vice versa. They ate together, processed together, recreated together, and slept by themselves. God forbid you actually got close to someone.

Healing House looked like a ranch house on steroids or [prednisone;]{.underline} it was all one story (to foil jumpers, OG guessed) but its proportions were bloated and extra-long. Two wings angled away from the main living area. These were called the Girl\'s Wing and the Boy\'s Wing, glorified dormitories that housed 16 girls and 16 boys, two to a room. Everything was decorated faux-house style, so on first glance it came across as a normal family home. The more you looked at it or god forbid, lived in it the less normal and more institutional it looked. Matching decorator rugs chosen to go with the color scheme art that was so bland as to seem like art without being an individual expression, all the cherry curtains and chintz, flavored fabric chosen to wear like iron and not show dirt or blood or the signs of multiple pukings. It was homey in the worst non-homelike way. It made you remember what was actually home without coming within a thousand miles of it.

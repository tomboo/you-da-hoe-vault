032109 OG Theme

What is this story truly about.

The question of life and how to live it is what the kids are struggling with. James wishes there was a course called Intro to Life. OG keeps getting pulled toward the dark side. She feels hopeless, like what's the use when life is so painful.

**OG state of Mind**

OG has also gotten inured to the sense of suicides' permanence; she had tried to kill herself or hurt herself so often, she suspected she was doomed to always come back for more suffering. She didn't know crap about Buddhism, but if she did, she would think this life was a shell, a carapace, and she was in the dung beetle phase of life - she was Kafka's Dung Beetle Girl- and the terrible thing was being doomed to always wake up. Ground Hog Day, a movie she saw when she lay on the couch napping and waking with the flu (she was 9 or 10) is the way she thinks of life and death. You kill yourself in ever inventive ways and always wakeup to make another attempt. If at first you don't succeed. Try, try again.

She wondered if all the suicide tries had aged her. She wasn't called Old Girl only because she was the longest tenured resident of Inner Horizons. Old Girl was how she felt: ancient and achy in her bones and tired of existence, like somebody who lived on and on into the hundreds and waited for death as the best option available.

Failure to thrive. In Intro to Psych, she had been reading about various afflictions in babies and toddlers. The one that spoke to her -- actually gave her goose bumps -- was failure to thrive syndrome. A baby fed and diapered and clothed but with no interaction, no closeness to other human beings, basically shriveled in its crib. Was she becoming a bag of bones? You end up as a bag of bones and you start out as a bag of bones. OG was waiting for the plump, roly-poly happy stage of her childhood to come back but it never did.

*On the way to the hike*

Weltschmerz. She ran into the word in her textbook and it even looked painful. World of hurt was the literal translation she put together when she paged back in the German-English dictionary. Had she always felt this way? Her memories of her childhood were so colored and faded with sunlight, all she could remember were ghosts. Happy ghosts, but still ghosts. It was the ever-present grayness of life that tired her out. Gray was the color of cement, like the January sky, that pressed on her shoulders like a burden. Yellow, sun-dappled ghost land was light as air. Who wouldn't rather be drawn up toward the light than pressed down to earth?

Why now?

New Girl's entrance into the landscape changes the landscape. James starts to unthaw, to imagine a life where he isn't a loser. OG gets a new roommate but she doesn't want to connect because she's already made up her mind to run. Rachel's fit gives her a window on another form of suffering. It makes her appalled @ the cruelty of life. She doesn't know the New Girl but she feels a kinship, a shared understanding of life as a thing to be endured. The addition of New Girl interferes with Leia's relationship with James. Rachel is also taking Abilify -- old Girl saw the nurse take the pills out of the same bottle. "Do you think this is working?" she asked Rachel, nodding to their identical blue pills in their identical plastic cups.

Each character interaction provides an opportunity to present the theme of how to live a different way. Rachel cuts herself to avoid or supercede the pain of loss and the pain and shame of being an epileptic.

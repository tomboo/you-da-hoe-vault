051309 Rachel and Nut Bird

When she wasn't in therapy four times a week, Rachel was in process group, or Art and Mindfulness class, or Nutrition and the Body Group, or Cognitive Behavior therapy, or filling out Dialectical Behavior worksheets, or writing papers and studying for her classes at NIC. *An idle mind is the devil's workshop.* The program\'s unspoken motto. They packed their schedules with activities so that nobody had time to get in trouble. That was the theory. In practice, though, everything except the community college classes led you into inner territory---the real devil's workshop\-- which anyone with any sense tried to avoid.

Rachel was supposed to be filling out a worksheet for therapy. She'd gotten through the first part of the assignment OK: answer how you think other people would describe you. People always treated her like a giant sequoia. She was five feet ten, but somehow people acted like she was Jack and the Beanstalk. Good at basketball they assumed, when really she sucked at anything athletic except running. She'd always been skinny, and once she started running she got more angular and tight. Looks good in spandex, she wrote. Then hastily erased it in case it made her look vain.

The second part of the assignment had her stumped.

*Describe how you see yourself.* How could she describe herself when she didn't have the foggiest idea who she was? If she showed her real self, she\'d have to show the stretch marks on her hips and the red striations around her navel from the baby kicking and shoving past her teen-tight, resistant muscles. She didn\'t even look pregnant till almost the sixth month. Between denying she could *be* pregnant and winning every cross country race her coach put her in, she had refused to admit anything was different about herself until one day, her internal muscles gave out and a round little melon belly popped free. *Hey presto*. One minute you're a contender for the state championships, and the next, you're trying to hide a watermelon in the girl's locker room. When the baby began throwing his elbows and kicking his heels like a street fighter, she wondered if she'd swallowed the Alien. The backseat groping with Kevin Cowen, her lab partner, never crossed her mind. *Hey, I'm in here!* She could ignored the baby calling. *"Can't you hear me?"* If she couldn't hear him, a part of her own body, the most important part of her body she'd ever felt, how could she hear herself now? She was hollowed out, an empty gourd, without even a dried pip inside to rattle around and remind her when she and the baby were one. Not a mother. Not yourself. Somewhere fatally in between.

It didn't help her concentration when a crazy robin kept throwing itself against her bedroom window.

She had been hearing an odd plink! plink! sound while she wrote. The garbage man heaved bins around in the parking strip, loading a seat-uppity. But the plink-plinks went on after he moved to the other end of the building.

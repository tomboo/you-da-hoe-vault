012919 James and Reza start crow scene

Ever since the Monkey Boy comment and James's abortive apology, Reza had kept his distance. He was mulish somehow, his small body planklike and stiff. It wasn't that he wasn't talking -- that was never going to happen -- but he seemed to be talking to himself. Before their blow-up, Reza seemed to want James' attention; now he didn't give a shit if he was listening.

He walked through the door, the slopped on shoes affixed to his skinny bow legs.

The story starts with a family therapy call that ends in a fight. James is glossing over his behavior in an impact letter. He talks about stealing or crashing his car, not about emptying an account for the mother-of-all parties, then crashes into a girl's car and leaves her bleeding & concussed by the side of the road, too drunk to remember what happened. So this story wouldn't be about the therapist /perfection theme. That would be d different story.

My story starts when James admits in an impact letter read to his parents the behaviors that got him sent to Wilderness camp and Inner Horizons **and then** his dad pokes under the glossed over story of the car crash and James goes ballistic with shame and anger and the call has to be terminated **and then** James runs into Rachel exiting the girl's bathroom after an encounter with Leia that Rachel has overheard on the NIC campus and Rachel asks him why he puts up with Leia's abuse **and then** Leia gets called out in Process for having sex with one of the gay girls which amazes James and then, before he

032109 James's story

"Why do you let her abuse you that way?"

"Abuse me? It's about sex," James said.

"It's about pulling your chain," Rachel replied. "Leia doesn't give a shit about you. Aren't you worth more than a blow job? "

I'm worth less than a blow job, James thought. He'd had the bad luck to run into Rachel in the girl's bathroom at Northern Idaho Community College. He was coming out of the disabled person's stall after waiting a minute or two for the coast to clear. Leia had already strolled out -- after reapplying her lipstick (blow jobs are rough on lipstick; James had pink stains on his underwear to prove it) -- while James took his time doing some back stretches. Standing sex was beginning to put a strain on his back. It wasn't that Leia was heavy, the opposite, in fact. Leia was more like an oversexed doll than a normal-sized 18- year-old like Rachel, who was leaning against the sink with an expression of concern in her eyes.

All three of them \-- James, Rachel, and Leia\-- plus 22 other "troubled young adults" were in the same residential treatment program in Couer D'Alene, Idaho. They were away from what was typically a 16-hour lockdown at Intensive, the Def-CON level of treatment for would be suicides, substance abusers alcoholics (James was one of them), self injurers, obsessive-compulsives, borderline personality disorders, anger management failures and a lot of plain old refusers-to-grow-up. Any screw up, if you were 18 to 24, got you a place at Inner Horizons, as long as the screw-up didn't involve being born poor.

"Do you mind?" Rachel waved at the stalls." Most people come in here to relieve themselves. "

So cut me some slack, James wanted to say. But the door swung open and shit-on-a-stick, James's Intro to Humanities teacher, Mrs. Lengel, walked in.

Lengel looked enquiringly at him (she wasn't a psychopath like Jewison, his Sociology professor) so James flashed her his trademark crumpled smile, like maybe she'd think he got mixed up between the Men and the Women and beat it out of there.

He didn't think Rachel would rat him out, but you never knew. Sometimes people made up stories about each other in Process Group to relieve the boredom. Rachel wasn't like that. She was a cutter and seemed a lot more interested in hurting herself than someone as lame as James.

James was heading to the library. He needed to rewrite his Impact Letter (for the fourth or fifth time); Josh, his therapist kept telling him he was being too general. *Make it real* he was always saying, which James interpreted as *make it bleed*. Frankly, James had bled plenty over his god-damned Impact Letter. What the hell did the name "Impact Letter" even mean. Impact on who? Not James, for sure; he'd already done all the shit and was past it, he told himself. He hoped the girl he ran into and left by the side of the road had miraculously gotten up from ns impact and walked off into a nappy life.

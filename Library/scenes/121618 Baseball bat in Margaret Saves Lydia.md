121618 Baseball bat in Margaret Saves Lydia

Margaret heaved herself out of the front seat with a might grunt. Almost before James had time to register what she was doing, she reached in the seat well and hoisted her purse out and strode away with it.

Fucking Lydia was about right. Two spaces away, James watched Margaret haul Lydia out of the passenger seat, blouse unbuttoned, pants unzipped. She was holding the wriggling girl and shouting at the man in the driver's seat. "Ned Simplot! Get your hands off my girl!"

She slammed the truck door shut. Shook Lydia like a bad, bad dog.\
"What's wrong with you, you ninnyhammer? He's old enough to be your dad!" Margaret's attention was fully on Lydia. James could see that she was completely unaware of the cowboy now coming around the bed of the pick-up with a baseball bat.

Then it was James turn to haul ass like an avenging angel.

James ran up behind the cowboy with a vague plan to wrestle the bat away and fling it over the truck bed to get rid of it.

"Hey, where's my Louisville Slugger?" the cowboy demanded.

As if. That piece of metal shit was a Cabela's special. Cheap ass ring-a-ding-ding metal without the satisfying crack of wood against hard leather.

James had no idea where the bat went after he picked it up and threw it. Neither did Margaret. They both shrugged. Not my problem.

Then it was James's turn to haul ass like an avenging angel. He ran behind the pick-up with the idea of jumping onto the cowboy's back and wrestling the bat away. Margaret beat him to the punch.

She let go of Lydia. She wound up like a discus thrower and clocked the cowboy on the side of his head. A satisfying meaty-sounded thump. He went to his knees like a sack of fertilizer. Margaret kept on whacking him with the purse in his ribs, on his shoulders, on the back of the neck. Thump. Thump. Thump.

The cowboy scuttled on all fours away from her, hollering, "Quit! You crazy cunt!"

Margaret turned. Hustled Lydia back to the van with one hand under her arm at the elbow as if Lydia was a very small child being removed from the scene of trouble by its mother.

"You!" she was saying to Lydia. "He's old enough to be your dad. Plus he's an idiot. And a John Bircher!"

James had no idea what a James Bircher was. Nor, based on the expression on her face, did Lydia. They were both so amazed by the mighty purse, they gave it a wide berth when they got back in the van. Lydia climbed all the way to the back. James got in front where his books were. *Lord of the Flies* right on top.

Margaret hollered at the cowboy who had managed to get up and was swaying on his feet. "Touch her again and I'll call the police."

She wheeled out of the parking space smartly. A metallic clang. Then a bump through the wheel well. Margaret didn't bother to ask what they'd hit.

James watched the cowboy in the side view mirror. He was leaning down to pick up a flattened bat. They were too far away to see if the man had murder in his eyes, but something in the way he held the now flattened bat reminded James of a crowbar.

Something about the way he raised the now flattened bat reminded James of a thug wielding a crowbar. "Stay away from him," Margaret was lecturing Lydia. "He's trouble." James agreed.

Lydia scene of changing the faucet gasket

> "How'd you meet him anyway," Margaret asked.

"The usual way. Around," Lydia said unforthcomingly. James knew what 'around meant': around the cowboy's dick, though he wasn't about to rat her out. He hadn't inhaled and he was still holding his breath waiting for Margaret to get around to his part of the trouble making.

"Well his mother, Nora Simplot, is very nice. Horse-mad, but nice. Ned was about ten when a horse stepped on him and he hasn't been the same since. You know he's almost forty, don't you?"

Lydia had no idea. Didn't care much either. As long as his wallet was big enough, age was irrelevant. Well, not totally. If she'd know he was forty, she would have said, no, thank you, and walked past him when he said hi to her at Dunkin' Donuts. But she'd needed the five bucks she cadged out of him to pay for her baker's dozen.

"You owe me," he had said. Story of her life.

Instead, she rubbed at her lower back. Sighed. Said, "I'm getting too old for this shit. And I'm out of shape."

"What the heck is in that thing," James asked, remembering how the cowboy crumpled to his knees.

"A pipe wrench." She reached into the bag and held up an industrial strength pipe wrench the size of a violin. "There's a leaky faucet in the girl's bathroom."

OG gets to know Rachel scene

OG noticed that in every picture of Rachel, her eyes were closed. "What's that about," she said, pointing.

"What?"

"You always have your eyes shut. How come?"

Rachel had no idea she did that. Trying to shut the world out? Or like a very young child, thinking if I can't see you, you can't see me? She barely registered the fact that she was so often hiding in plain sight. A failure of nerve, she decided. Life is cruel and mean. If you don't look at it, maybe it won't hurt you. Not an adult perspective for sure.

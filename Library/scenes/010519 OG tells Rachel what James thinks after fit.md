010519 OG tells Rachel what James thinks after fit

James thought you were dying, OG said, apropos of nothing.

"When?"

"Today. When you had your gaping fish moment."

"That's what you call my epileptic fit? A gasping fish moment."

"Gaping, gasping. What does it matter?" OG turned a page of Lord of the Flies. "You looked like a trout. The way you were opening and closing your jaws."

"Oh my God. I didn't."

"James didn't notice. He was too busy keeping your legs from tapdancing."

"Jesus H. Christ. Kill me now."

OG looked up from her page where the boys were stoning Piggy. "He wanted to hold your head but Darlene told him you might bite him."

Deep, profound silence. The expression on Rachel's face was appalled, slightly nauseated.

"It could have been worse." OG tried to help her out a little. "At least you didn't pee in your pants."

"I did."

Hmm. "Well if somebody noticed, you'd already know about it."

That's a mercy."

Hard to imagine how, but hey, can you throw a black girl a white lie?

Rachel's voice came to OG muffled because it had to make its way through the \\ blankets she'd thrown over her head. "I really do want to kill myself."

"You and half the people here. Tell me something new."

The bone OG threw, even though she was afraid it was dangerously friendly, was a gesture of solidarity. Rachel finally looked at her and she raised both hands towards her, wrists up.

In the rumpled bed across the room, both of Rachel's hands emerged out of the covers. They had matching vertical scars: The suicide fuck-up's salute.

"You're a nut," Rachel blew her nose, got up, extracted a big clump of used Kleenex from her sheets, and dumped the wad in the trash.

"Takes one to know one," OG said, deciding to stop reading about Piggy. "At least you're in pleasant company."

010318 First sighting of Lydia thru OG

Lydia wore an Yves Saint Laurent scarf. The one with the glacier lilies---or were they avalanche lilies? -- whatever, they were white and yellow blooms on creamy silk.

OG was wearing her customary black. It matched her daily mood and pragmatically speaking, it didn't show the dirt. Lydia by contrast looked chick and put-together in jeans and the Italian leather boots she loved so much. Around her neck was a scarf of white and yellow blooms that reminded OG of glacier lilies -- or were they avalanche lilies?---the ones that poked their heads up through the snow in the Idaho spring. Dani had asked to borrow the scarf and Lydia, in a snooty nasal approximation of French, said, "Yves St. Laurent is too expensive for you," which is why the scarf was now shorter than it had been originally, through its slashed end was artfully hidden under a twist. Nobody fessed up to taking the scissors to it but Lydia and Dani were now ex-BFF's so it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess. OG was waiting for Dani to get hers in the never-ending cycle of internecine warfare that roiled like a river of bile beneath the surface of enforced good behavior.

The Program kept its residents in line with a score sheet from the Four Quadrants of Daily Living. Therapists and staff awarded fours for making beds (three if you were sloppy); getting up on time; taking a daily showers; speaking up in Process group, passing the salt. James had gotten a one for lobbing the shaker at his roommate Reza last week. Ones meant lost treadmill time, no bowling, no allowance of your measly five bucks a week, being kept indoors instead of being allowed outside for Outdoor Recreation day. If you were awarded enough ones in the holy quadrants of I, you, we, and they, you regressed from whatever stage you'd managed to get to in Inner Horizon's arcane system of "staged" recovery. The brochures said clients were supposed to get out of Intensive after three; OG had just made it out after 14 months. Rachel, was starting out as a noob so she was in Intensive which in reality meant lock down with no recreation, no college classes, no community service, no stupid little nothing job, and nada besides staring at your peers within four walls inside Healing House while being bombarded by incessant therapy.

Nobody wanted a one today. After Process Group, they'd be promises a snowshoe hike. It was their second outdoor activity in two days because they'd been trapped on top of each other inside during three weeks of snow storms. No wonder the place was so airless with despair and loathing, it was hard to breathe.

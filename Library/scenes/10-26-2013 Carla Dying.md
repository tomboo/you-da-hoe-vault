Carla Dying

A week ago Carla died and it\'s been weeks of distractions. I\'m amazed that the world is going on without her yet intensely aware of its life and beauty and energy. The fog was thick all week, creating moments of grace when the sun fought through and it seemed other-worldly in its beauty. The gold foil colors of the leaves, the muted reds, the yellow of turning maples that the streets of Seattle were all lit by the giant diffuser of sun through fog. Carla was missing it and I felt my own eye taking it in.

I found a tee-shirt in her close that said Be Present.

I didn\'t feel her presence in the empty condo yesterday. It just felt empty. A collection of things, not her. She\'d packed away all her size 4 underwear as if she expected to return to her former sexy young and slender self. Monica said, \"Wish I\'d known that last week at the hospital when I need a change of panties.\"

In the hospital, she said, \"This is a grave robber\'s den.\" I laughed, taking her joke to mean that we were keeping her in the room, alive. We had been talking about the fact that Monica was wearing one of her sweaters and I pulled a corner of her undies out from my pants to show her I raided her panty drawer, since neither Mom nor I had been home for days.

I loved the fact that language can go both ways. It\'s what makes communication difficult but it\'s also what makes it so rich.

Maybe Carla recognized her clothing on her sisters as she was dying; she must have felt a desire to keep alive in that room. A grave robber\'s den for as long as humanly possible.

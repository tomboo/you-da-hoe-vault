111615 Causality and Lydia

Ways to up Lydia's pathos? She's neglected & bulimic and a sex addict. The metaphor is empty and filled. That's why she has a bag fetish like Madeleine. She has nothing to put in them---no money, no keys, no credit card, only an NICC student ID which gets you into nowhere you want to go---and the gaping maw of the purses indexes to her inner being.

She's attached to her bags because they give her exterior value. Her thing---her room is almost a department store of things---are all she has to show her worth. She hoards the because without them she feels naked. When she gives her Judith Lieber bag to Lorenzo to raise money, she feels like she's parting with the best part of herself, the expensive, rare and beautiful part and she's afraid he'll see that all that is left of her is ugly and bare.

1.  What if Lydia is mean to the new girl and treats Rachel like her enemy because she's mad at losing James. James is another possession to Lydia, something she dangles on her arm and without him, she look and feels worse about herself. It's not about how she feels about James; it's about how James makes her look.

2.  What is Lydia joins in the Esty bullying. Then I could write a self-punishment scene where she scarifies herself under her arm or puts a pin in her underwear that pokes into her and gives her blood poisoning.

3.  What if the only thing of value in her purse is a pack of condoms that she ends up gifting to Lorenzo, who won't has no use for them because he's not going to have sex outside of marriage. The emptiness she feels after she gives her bag to Lorenzo causes her to run to Dunkin' Donuts and eat until she sticks a finger down her throat and throws up till there's nothing inside her except bile.

4.  What if she goes to her room after the bullying episode where she's disgusted and horrified at herself for tormenting Esty. She closes the heat vent and lays down on the narrow strip of hardwood between the rug and the wall and she sleeps without blankets until Margaret comes in for an early shift and finds her curled up and shivering like a naked grub.

5.  What if Lydia has her own kind of moral accounting? She keeps a rigid balance sheet in her head. When she hurts someone or lashes out in anger or projects her self-hatred onto the people around her, she has to atone in many creative ways. She has a sleep torture system when she's really, really bad, like the night she torments Esty until she puts a fork in the back of Reza's hand. She is horrified that she has aligned herself with psychopath Danny and sycophant Reza, both of whom nauseate the hit out of her, and so she figures out a way to punish herself in the worst way.

> \--if she's just middling bad, like when she laughs at someone's expense or pokes fun at someone trying to look good or says something mean just a little too loudly so they overhear---then she has to sleep without a pillow. Just a sheet. It's her behavior is worse, like she makes somebody cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose uses a favorite cashmere sweater to mop up grape juice (Danny), she makes herself strip the bed and sleep on the bare mattress. When she's horrible, like today when she torments Esty and gets her sent to Stabilization, she makes herself sleep on the barte floor in her underwear. Usually she positions herself in the narrow space between the single bed and the wall but before she lies down in the dust bunnies, she sees a wolf spider and its nest in the corner where she's used to

> putting her head. If she'd killed someone, say she's stabbed them in the heart or shoved them in front of an oncoming subway, she would have made herself lay her head right in the nest but her torment of Esty isn't quite that heinous, is it? So she negotiates with her inner judge to close the heat vent and lie naked in front of the window where there's a draft.

> After they dragged Esty off to Stabilization, Lydia had their room all to herself. That was good because when Esty was around, it was hard to keep to her self-punishment regime.
>
> She stripped down to a thin camisole and bikini underpants. No thermal nightgown or flannel P.J.s for her. Not after what she'd done earlier in the evening. When the cat plays with the mouse too long, it requires atonement.
>
> She did her usual skin care and make-up removal lathering \$150-an-ounce eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, then she exfoliated the dead cells from her face and splashed astringent from the Dead Sea all over to close her pores, and ended with a slap of toner from some Korean spa her mother loved all over. She tried not to look at the bare strip of oak flooring next to the window which was crystalized on the outside with ice diamonds. Her feet sensed the cold draft from the inch of open window she made herself leave and a prickle of skin on the back of her neck rose in anticipation of the real thing.
>
> You made your bed, no lie in it, she told herself. She knelt like a cloister penitent on bare knees, then settled herself on her side so that the draft from under the door from the poorly heated hallway met the cold snow flakes drifting in from the window.
>
> It was dim in the silent room. A silver glow from the warning moon reflected off the snow fields that led to the pulp mill and beyond to the train tracks. The house settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans. She kept her eyes open so she could watch the slow progress of the moon creeping down the far wall and crawling cold blue light towards her goose bumped skin. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.
>
> A whisper of cold air brought up goose bumps up on her legs and arms. Quiet, she ordered her trembling to stop. You did this. You're disgusting. You're nothing. Behave.

120918 introducing Margaret at opening

"Vaginas don't smell. That's a myth."

Reza looked slightly uneasy, as if was hiding something.

"What? You've never been with a girl?"

"They smell fishy." Reza looked puffed up, defiant, as if an acne-burdened underweight South East Indian homeboy in falling down pants could look like a turkey with ruffled feathers. "That's what I heard."

"Salty, more like." Like the sea, James had read in a poem. He was never thinking about the smell or even the texture or the feeling, just about performance mostly and whether the girl was as into it as he was.

Come to think of it, he had heard a queef but just hadn't known the word for it. James was reminded of Sam, their old gardener, who said, "If you live long enough, you'll get to see everything twice. Maybe even a miracle." At sixteen, the first time he'd heard a queef, it was a miracle to be naked with an 18-year-old girl.

Reza said, "You won't tell anybody, will you?"

"Tell anybody what?"\
"That I don't have a girlfriend."

James wanted to say that he doubted anybody believed that lie anyway but seeing the anxious expression on Reza's face, he refrained. "Who cares?" He slapped Reza on the back with more force than necessary. "Plenty of good looking girls in Idaho."

The garbageman banged the garbage barrels out back like he was beating on them. Idaho didn't have normal garbage cans. These were giant industrials cans for oil or PCBs or solvents. Idaho didn't have garbage service either. It had a simian looking, filthy guy in coveralls and snowy PACS the color of tea who came around once a week and hoisted the barrels on his shoulder and didn't seem to notice the goo that dripped from the can down his neck or back. Rusty, Margaret called him. He looked rusty today with coveralls the same color as the dirty red barrel on his back.

Margaret, the Day Supervisor, stood at the front door, letting a blast of frigid air in. A big middle-aged woman, her Sansabelt pants and shapeless sweatshirt with the University of Idaho's Joe Vandal mascot grinning his insane bearded grin didn't do her many favors, if she was trying to camouflage the size of her butt and thighs. She was reading the garbage man the riot act -- Rusty, you knothead, she had shouted to get his attention. He was bellowing that he didn't have room for all the trash because he was full up. "Full up, my ass," Margaret bellowed back. You missed pick-up last week. Where in hell were you?"

Drunk, was his reply. Not your usual comeback from the city-employed garbage workers in Naperville, Illinois, where OG lived with Aunt Peggy and Uncle David.

All this was going on while Reza continued to stammer and wheeze through his incomprehensible Impact Letter.

"Stop," Darlene finally ordered him. "Margaret, shut the door. You're interrupting Process."

Margaret, in the act of rolling her eyes and slamming the door shut, looked surprised to see the whole of Healing House gathered in the living room, though it was a twice weekly ritual, rain, shine, snow or earthquake. "Sorry," she mouthed with no sound and she made a big show of tiptoeing her bulk back to the kitchen.

Good old Margaret. She was the only normal one among the staff which was why she was the worst paid, according to Margaret.

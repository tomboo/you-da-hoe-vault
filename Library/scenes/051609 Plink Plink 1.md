051609 Plink Plink

The plink! plink! interrupted her thoughts. Every time she fastened upon an idea of herself -- kindly, someone who treated people how she would want to be treated herself, a lover of cats and dogs (dogs more than cats, but any beating heart with warm fur would do) -- another plink would dink against the glass. It sounded like someone was tossing tissue- wrapped stones at her window. She got up and threw the sash open and stuck her head out. A garbage man heaved bins into a beat-up pick-up in the parking lot. In Indiana, giant trash-mashing garbage factories with automated hoists and hydraulics arrived like clock work to deal with the refuse. In unincorporated, rural Idaho, some Cro Magnon man in filthy coveralls came by every once in a while for the trash. There didn't seem to be any set schedule. Sometimes, garbage collected for days and the bins exploded, attracting ravens and raccoons and once, an ancient turkey vulture who set up camp next to Rachel's room and woke her at dawn with its rusty squawks.

Vultures, coyotes, now a nutcase robin, Rachel thought. Your own Private Idaho.

How did people see her? She spent so much time trying to be invisible, she felt like an shell in public, with an exterior like an outline that only looked like a tall, pony-tailed girl. She knew men looked at her -- when she ran, catcalls followed her past construction sites, guys tried to sit next to her in class to blab but when she didn't respond, they lost interest and moved on to girls who actually responded. The only time she opened her mouth in was Lengel's American Lit class --and that was only because her grade depended on class participation. Lengel randomly called her out and she was forced to say what she thought, even if it was something lame like Huck treated Jim like his personal slave on the raft, which Lengel argued vehemently against saying that Huck only treated Jim the way he'd seen the rest of the world treat a black man ("like a slave! That's my point," Rachel had said, surprising herself with how loud her voice reverberated in the quiet classroom.)

So, *quiet.* She wrote on her worksheet in careful printed letters that leaned backward, as if even the slant of her letters would avoid revealing her outer self.

The worst part of being pregnant, once the size of her belly made it impossible to deny the baby, even to herself, was that she became an object of intense and unrelenting interest. You couldn't get a sandwich in the lunch line without the lunch ladies asking her how she felt. She could feel the other girls staring at her as she parted the hallways like a ship. In high school where everybody wanted boobs and hips, sprouting a fat belly was worse than having a giant zit the size of her head. Even the stoners and Goth kids in trench coats and black lipstick treated the girl in maternity smocks like she had the plague.

The maternity smocks were mom's idea. She came home one day with a big bag from Target with middle aged plaids and yellow and black bumblebee stripes you could see from a mile away. When Rachel told her she'd rather wear Dad's extra-large shirts, Mom said, "Beggars can't be choosers." Mom also said, "You made your bed, now you'll have to lie in it" when Rachel told her she was pregnant. Mom never heard a cliché she didn't want to best a dead horse with.

Plink.

Rachel threw off the sweat shirt she was using to warm her legs and went outside to investigate. It was early, still an hour until breakfast. Rachel woke up at 4 or 5 every morning and used the sleepless time to do her homework or to write drivel in her journal. She didn't see the garbage man, but she could hear him thrashing cans around the corner.

At robin chittered and cheeped in a shrub close to her window.

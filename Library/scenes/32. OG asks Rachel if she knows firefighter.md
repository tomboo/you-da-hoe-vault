32\.

\"DID YOU KNOW THAT FIREFIGHTER?" Old Girl asked Rachel when Charlene finally gave them the go-ahead to go back into Healing House. Once the fire was out, the firefighters closed the fire doors and blocked off the girl\'s wing. The plan was to set up a makeshift slumber party for the girls in the living room and let the boys go back to bed.

Rachel asked \"What firefighter?\"

\"He was standing next to you." Old Girl looked around and the man in the bright new jacket was gone. \"When... you know, when James gave you the blanket."

Rachel looked blank.

\"He seemed to know you,\" she said.

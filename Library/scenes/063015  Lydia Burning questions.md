063015 Burning questions

Lydia

It was perfectly clear to Lydia why she wanted to have sex with James and the guy at the Student Union cafeteria and Mr. Timms, the World History teacher with the pony keg of a paunch, and whoever else she might run into that day. Sex felt great during. It was just the after that didn't feel so great.

She'd have wet stuff running down the inside of her leg and there was always that awkward moment between pull out and getting her jeans re-zipped when two people who had just been intimate usually avoided eye contact. The guy might tell her it was mind blowing or or rocked his world or something equally lame while she could feel him wanting to be somewhere else. and he'd run off with his shirt hanging out of his pants (james) or the buttons off kilter on his shirt (Mr. Timms) or his shoe laces untied (the guy at the gas station who gave her a Coke and said, "Bottoms up.") She didn't like to think about the after. Much more fun to think of the before when James or Mr. Timms or Randy---it took a minute to raise the name of the sideburns guy though they fucked weekly in the pig truck\--whoever it was would be burning with anticipation, body on fire, sperm cells marshaling to explode in a big hot whoosh, a light sheen of sweat salting their neck.

She used to orgasm all the time. Lately, though, the Big O was the least of it. What she really, really liked was that feeling of being able to tie someone in knots. Being able to turn her partner upside down and hold him in her hand and ask him to bark like a dog, if she wanted.

It was that moment of power she craved. Control over someone's sweat glands and their panting, when they were at their weakest, at their most abject and out of control. That was the mind-blowing part. They'd be jerking and she'd be above them or below them, avidly watching them give up all their volition to her and she'd want to pound on her chest and give out a great big gorilla scream. I made you do that! Let me make you do it again!

She had no trouble getting people to have sex with her. She was petite and pretty with a great ass and nice, if somewhat small, firm boobs. The thing she couldn't understand was why nobody wanted anything to do with her except sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped. They couldn't seem to get away from her fast enough.

Why didn't anyone want to stay? Why did she always feel like crying when they left her on the street with wet spunk running down her leg and the smell of musk all over her and not a kind word to show for it.

She could understand why prostitutes charged for sex. At least they had something to show for it besides an STD.

Why did guys like James always leave? What was wrong with her that they didn't want to stay? It was like they were somehow on to her desire to make them weak and once they got what they wanted, they understood she didn't have anything else to give.

What else would you give someone when you already gave them access to your body? She had no fucking clue.

One time James muttered "I feel dirty" after a marathon round of monkey sex.

It felt like he had just slapped her. "I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's like..." James thought for a long moment as he tried to formulate his thoughts. "You suck me off like a Hoover vacuum. It's so mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels awfully impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

"There's no give and take." He was holding a spent condom between his thumb and forefinger like it was disgusting when in fact, it was filled with his sperm.

"You make me feel used," he said.

Used and abused was how she felt when he walked away.

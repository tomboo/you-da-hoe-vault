> 110618 Rusty Watches the Fire from Afar

He humped back across the snow field to call in the fire and then sat on his ass and waited for the squad to arrive. His plan was to drive up to join them at the last minute until it occurred to him it would be better to be already on duty so that piss-ant Scholtz couldn't ride him for being late. Besides, if he moved the truck now, he'd be stranded at the end of the lane due to all the cars ahead of him. It wasn't as far to hump across the field again from where he was already parked so maybe he saved himself some steps. That was using his noggin, like his old man was always trying to beat into him.

The problem was, once he got to the side yard, what he really wanted to do was invite the girl to come sit in the truck. He wanted to blast the heat up to high and tell her he was one of the first responders on the scene -- true, since he'd napped in the crawl space a couple hours till all the crazies went to bed and then he brought out the turpentine soaked rags from his pocket.

> If he'da followed the plan, instead of jerking off in the truck, he'da been first in line instead of being stuck a field away and the darkie girl would be sitting next to him in a warm cab instead of being felt up in some blond turd's blanket. Shit for brains, he could still hear the old man in his good ear, because his bad ear hadn't heard a the crack of his ass since the old man whipped him on that side of his noggin.

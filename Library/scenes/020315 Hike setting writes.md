020315 Hike setting writes

The Suburban hammered North along Highway 95 through a blight of malls and billboards, past the Wild Waves attraction the locals were so proud of, until the Jack-in the-Boxes were replaced by boxy lone cabins, a farm with humped and alien hay stacks. The world outside the car was white and silent. Lake Pend Oreille looked like a white snaking river with a thin stripe of open black water at its heart. Pond-O-Ray as the locals pronounced it. A French left over from some old trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter.

Giant snow-hung Ponderosa Pines pinched off light on the trail. It felt claustrophobic and a whumph of snow dropping from the branches in a blinding plume made him jump. He was soon sweating and throwing off layers of down and wool and polyester that had sucked up his stink. James had expected a sense of freedom and largeness when Mom and Dad told himthey were sending him to the Idaho wilderness "to grow up." Instead, he felt small and inconsequential. He sensed miles and miles of trees and mountains that stretched forever. If you fell, no one would ever find you.

Old Girl's side of the room looked like a monk's cell. No photos of family, no knick-knacks.

Rachel set a photo of her Merrilee and Alex, her fiancé, wearing stupid Mexican sombreros in Mazatlannext to Mom and Dad on safari in Namibia. She always liked the photo of them in a Range Rover with a cheetah out the window, sitting on its haunches in the same pose as Fluffer, their lab. Old Girl looked like she'd never moved in. Maybe she just hadn't given in to the idea she was going to stay. Rachel laid the quilt Grandma gave her on the bed. It was a crazy quilt of velvet and polka dots and purple and orange spangled oddities that somehow all worked together even though none of it matched. Weird. Old Girl's closet was almost empty except for a few clinking hangers. Rachel eyed her two big suitcases and wondered if she had anything Old Girl would want.

070217 Color theory re Rachel and James

James was trying to figure out what color Rachel\'s skin really was. Mahogany? Dark teak? Black coffee? It was a warm dark like the blue or violet-tinged shadow on a sunny day. A beautiful rich color with purple tones in some light. Her hair was a darker black, sometimes nappy, other times tightly curled.

Other people\--Josh, for example\-- had skin the color of burnt black, the kind of black after a fire burns through a forest. But Josh\'s skin wasn\'t dead looking. It was closer to the color of rich dark soil that could grow anything in its loamy depths.

Rachel was a coffee-colored red brown, warm toned. Her hair was two-toned with dark curls close to her scalp and lighter toned honey-brown curls at the ends.

James had no idea what he thought about black-white relations. We are all alike under our skin so why be considered different in it? He thought of color as immaterial. Kind of like in his crayon box, whether one color was royal blue or sunny yellow or lipstick red. Each crayon had its own beauty, its own properties.

The color construct in America was based on history and what minority races had been put through. History is what colors people, not their skin.

Adopted children come as a blank slate because whatever history the bio-family has experienced is hiding behind the mother\'s choice to give the child up.

That\'s the one piece of history that ties all adoptive people together. Someone gave them up which is a mere half-step from \"nobody wanted me.\"

Rachel said to James fiercely, \"My mother gave me up but goddamn it, I wanted my baby! I didn\'t choose to give him up at all.\"

\"How do you know the same thing didn\'t happen to your birth mom?\" James asked.

Her look was blank. \"What are you saying?\"

\"Well, someone could have leaned on her like they leaned on you. Told her they wouldn\'t help if she kept you.\"

\"How would you know if she gave a shit?\"

James opened his hands. Palms up, there were the same color as Rachel\'s palms except around the edges where the skin that ringed the edges was a pinkish, moving to purplish-black. \"I know you and I bet you\'re more like your mother than you know.\"

\"Poor woman,\" Rachel said. \"Poor thing.\"

\"Do you want to meet her?\"

Rachel hesitated. \"It would kill my adoptive mom.\"

\"I thought you hated her.\"

\"She raised me! She did the best she could.\"

\"Why can\'t you say the same thing about your biological mother? She didn\'t leave you out on a rock, did she? Or you wouldn\'t be here.\"

\"Never thought about it,\" she mumbled.

\"Why are you taking her part? You don\'t know her!\"

\"I know you,\" he said. \"That gives me more information than you think.\"

\"This is a weird place,\" Rachel said. They were walking down the block and the Coeur d\'Aleners\--all white people\--opening their shops and getting ready for the day.

\"Weird how?\"

\"It\'s like \-- well, everybody looks the same.\"

This was pretty funny to James because she said it while she was looking at a big fat shopkeeper with a fringe or iron gray hair around his sweating pink skull. He was standing over a fat kid with a broom who looked exactly like his dad except for a slightly smaller belly. \"Like those two?\" he teased.

\"Yeah, them. And everybody, really. I haven\'t seen one Asian person. Nobody wearing a hijab.\"

\"Would you wear a hijab in Idaho?\"

\"Only if I wanted to get stoned.\"

James had a memory flash of the red-haired girl taking a drag from his hash-laced weed. He pushed it aside like an unwelcome visitor. \"Ever get any shit here?\"

\"Just weird looks so far.\"

Now the fat man had the fat kid\'s broom and he seemed to be showing him how to sweep.

\"I bet I\'m the only black person in five hundred miles.\"

\"Nope. You haven\'t met Josh. He\'s my therapist and he lives here with his wife.\"

\"I wonder how they stand it?\"

\"They do rap demonstrations to raise extra cash.\"

Her eyes got wide. \"They don\'t!\"

\"Of course not,\" James said. \"Had you going, didn\'t I?\"

The fat kid was no longer paying attention to his father who was giving the broom quite a work out. He stared at them. Well, specifically, he stared at Rachel.

\"Look, you\'ve got his full attention.\"

\"Should I let him pinch me to see if I'm real?\" Rachel said.

James lowered his voice. \"You know he could be staring at you because you\'re beautiful.\"

The light changed and they walked across the street leaving the sweeping fat family behind.

\"I can\'t walk into a store without someone saying, \'Can I help you,\'\" Rachel said.

This was funny because Margaret had sent them into find some plumbing fixture and they were walking up and down the aisles and couldn\'t find a soul to help them.

\"Couldn\'t you act like you are about to steal something? Look furtive. Pat your pocket.\"

She chucked James on the arm. \"You nut. I\'m serious.\"

A man in a red vest rounded the corner. He walked right up to them and said like magic to Rachel, \"Can I help you?\"

She smiled archly at James. She didn\'t have to say \"see\" because James saw for himself that she was right.

All the manifestations of the earworm that is Youdaho.

Idaho became a state of mind: an alien, unfriendly place; a weird place with weird rules; a place where nobody feels at home in the sense of \"You-Da-Ho, not You\'re at Home here.\" It\'s a place where people say \"go past the crick\" or \"shut your pie hole \" and drive around with guns in their pick-ups ready to pop off at the slightest opportunity

Youdaho for getting stuck in a place where they sell live bait next to the gum rack at 7-Eleven.

Youdaho for coming to a place where people drive around with guns in gun racks so they can shoot rattle snakes and gophers just for fun.

Bus scene

\"What\'s wrong with those kids?\" Rachel cried. The bus with all the white faces pressed against the windows moved off. \"Haven\'t they ever seen a black person?\"\
\"Not really,\" Margaret said. \"I still remember seeing my first black person when I was five on a train to Chicago. This is a pretty white place.\"

\"I feel like a freak,\" Rachel said.

Margaret reached across the seat and patted her arm with a meaty hand. \"I know, hon. It\'s not fun to be different. They\'re just ignorant.\"

\"Oh my God,\" Rachel said. \"They\'re pointing at me.\" She patted her hip, turned to look at her butt thinking maybe she had something on her butt.

James laughed. \"There\'s nothing wrong with you. They\'re just ignorant.\"

Her forehead crinkled. \"Don\'t they watch TV? What about Samuel Jackson? Dr. Dre? Kanye West? It\'s not like I\'m the only black person in the world.\"

Margaret interjected herself in the conversation from the front seat. \"You\'re the only one they\'ve seen up close,\" she said.

\"There must be some black people who live here. It\'s 2017.\"

\"Nope. It\'s still 1963 and Lyndon Johnson is still president,\" Margaret said.

Rachel persisted. \"Why aren\'t there any black people in Idaho?\"

\"Too cold?\" Margaret guessed.

\"Too weird,\" James aid.

Too lonely, is what Rachel concluded. It\'s hard to live alone in a cold, hostile place.

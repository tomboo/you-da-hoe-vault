What if you kept trying to kill yourself and you kept screwing up? What if you were such a screw up, they locked you up with a lot of other screw-ups in backwoods Idaho in order to get sane? This is the situation Old Girl finds herself in when she's locked up at Inner Journeys, a psychiatric treatment program for troubled teens in Couer D'Alene, Idaho.

What if you were such a screw up, you kept screwing up your own suicide so your guardians dumped you in backwoods Idaho with a bunch of other screw-ups to help you get sane?

My novel You-Da-Ho explores the thin line between normal adolescent craziness and true mental illness through the eyes of four troubled young adults who battle the temptations of alcohol, drugs, sex, and doing whatever the hell they want. They\'re all locked up at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment center outside Coeur d\'Alene, Idaho, where no one seems to notice that the doctor who runs the Program is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there while a real psychopath stalks the treatment center in a garbage truck.

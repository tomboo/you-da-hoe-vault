060416 Why sex is better essay from Lydia

**Because** if I like my sex partners, there's something wrong with them.

**Because** if they like me for more than sex, there's something drastically wrong with them.

Lydia had been having therapy since she was eleven but this session with Josh was a first. A therapist who pushed and prodded instead of letting her lead him like a goat? She unpacked her yoga-crossed legs and got up and perched warily on the couch across from him. "Are you asking me to have sex?"

"I'm asking you to convince me to have sex. As I understand it, Darlene asked you to explain why indiscriminate sex with people who don't care about you is good for you." He tilted his regal head so one light hazel-yellow eye speared her. "So convince me."

The way he said it made her think of some old story she heard at synagogue crèche one day while Grandpa Ben was two floors above her listing to the rabbi sing through his nose. King Somebody -- David? Ben Israel?---raised a baby up over a chopping block while two mothers wailed. Convince me why I shouldn't cut this infant in half, the King told the mothers.

She scrabbled around in her back pack and drew out a note book with a large black doodle of hearts and flowers that read, "Fuck me." She'd spent the last couple of days adding answers to the Darlene\'s question of why she was always having sex with people who didn't care about her. Every time a new answer occurred to her, she started out with the word "Because" and she was surprised to see how many pages of Becauses she'd written since Monday.

*Because it fills up the time* flitted through her consciousness but she decided not to jot it down because Josh would think she hadn't done the assignment if he saw her writing in it last minute.

He sat straight on an austere hard backed chair and something about his calm air of centeredness made me want to move from the nubby couch to the seat in the corner of the plaid couch right next to him. She cleared her throat and read in a low monotone.

Why sex is better with people who don't care about you.

***Because*** sex can be a transaction with clearly defined boundaries and no leakage except of bodily fluids, thus there is no confusion about why you're doing it.

***Because*** if James or Jed or Austen who got fired for having sex with me because I was his patient---because if any of those people liked me, it would be evidence that they were fucked up. If they wanted me in their club, I wouldn't want to belong to it.

***Because*** if they cared about me, it would be cloying or suffocating or pushy or like being in a prison under someone else's control.

***Because*** if they cared about me, they would expect me to care about them back and that's way out of my league. Leave them before they can leave you first and no one gets hurt.

***Because*** people who don't care put up a reasonable facsimile of caring; they fondle and pet and kiss and lick just like the real thing and it's easy to close your eyes and imagine that this is the way it should be.

***Because*** I can control the where and when and in what orifice depending on how I want them to get off. Want to do it in the closet outside the Principal's office and wipe your spunk off on the hem of Mrs. Daily's raincoat? That feels good. Want to stand behind me on the gym balcony parapet and fuck me from behind while the Pep squad performs below us and the squeak of the rubber shoes on the floor boards covers up your groans? Exciting. If you can imagine it, I can make it happen for you because there's no limit to the rush I get when you breathe in my ear, "Lydia, you make me fucking crazy."

***Because*** the whole point is not for me to get off, the point is to get you off and make you want me again and again so I can say, "No thanks, I'm bored," when you want me so much you'd put your dick in my mouth in front of your mother.

***Because*** having sex is like blowing your nose or throwing up some bad chicken or watching yourself bleed from a self-inflicted cut. It's just one way to feel something in a cotton wool world. Because taking a dump sometimes works equally well.

**Because** sex only lasts a few minutes. Rustle, poke, boom. Then you're looking for your next poke and boom.

***Because*** love isn't doled out along with the condoms in the machine. Use your quarters for something that doesn't leak.

***Because*** not caring keeps things polite. It's bad form to pretend the act has meaning when all it is adds up to "put Tab B in Slot A" until you explode.

***Because*** sex is all I want. It's what I deserve.

***Because*** sex smells good, especially if you're out of expensive perfume. Guys smell it on you and they always want their spunk to replace the spunk that came before.

**Because** a young body deserves an old body's gratitude.

***Because*** I didn't study for my algebra test and it is easier and takes less time to give a blow job than to do 20 differential equations.

**Because** every long white bird looks better in a nest.

***Because*** sex feels better than cutting for a minute. A numb, cotton wool existence is relieved by a flash of red, bursting light. You feel alive and in control of your essential self for a short, instant until the brightness dims and you're dwindle back to gray.

***Because*** it almost feels like they care about you. For one clawing, reaching instant when your partner trembles on the edge of losing his essential self, you're the only thing in the world. It\'s the same feeling the vampire gets when his needle-sharp teeth break through the victim\'s skin. The victim jerks and you know absolutely, categorically, you\'ve hit a vein.

The pause after Lydia stopped speaking lengthened into a ticking beat of the clock in the corner. Air whooshed and hummed on its journey through a duct. "Good work," Josh finally said. "Thorough. Very thought out."

"Did I do it right?" she asked.

"I'm not sure there is a right way to answer that question."

"I meant... umm... did I explain myself? Convince you?"

His light eyes were locked on her but there was no come-hither expression on his face. "You convinced me there are a lot of reasons why you do what you do. Some of them make a lot of sense."

"So I'm not crazy?"

"You can be crazy and still make sense, Lydia."

"You use sex for barter, sex for boredom, sex for penance, sex for power, sex for comfort, sex for money..." He ticked off a lengthening list and she realized he'd been taking notes why she was reading. The list went on and on. "...sex for shock, sex for ego gratification, sex as a substitute for a thank you note, sex for notches on your belt, sex for food or rides or cigarettes..."

He looked up at that point. "Do you smoke?"'

She shook her head. When his expression turned quizzical, she explained, "It makes your breath smell bad."

"So why trade?"

"Cigarettes are money at Program. If you have cigs, you don't have to do chores."

\"Ah.\"

Time seemed to bloom outward at the same instant it fell inward as Josh ticked off the list. This was either the longest or the shortest therapy session in her experience it felt as if Josh was X-raying her naked, shriveled soul.

"Did I miss anything? Anything else you use sex for?"

For one of the few times in her life, Lydia felt a kind of awe and pride at the creativity expressed on the list.

"I thought about it helping you lose weight," she said. "Because you're burning calories."

"It's not on the Weight Watcher's point system." Then he added solemnly, "If you take an average size man and roll him off of you, you could lose 180-hey, 200 pounds of dead weight."

He was joking? A choked kind of laugh escaped her like a fart.

"OK, oh wise one, you have to use that big brain you're so used to hiding under all those curls. What is missing from this list? What do most people want from sex?"

For the life of her, she couldn't think of anything that wasn't listed in neat girlish handwriting drilled into her by Frau Grabrauber at the Swiss finishing school.

"How about common caring?" Josh asked. "Comfort? How about a sense of safety? Warmth? It might include all of those things without mentioning the word love."

It was Josh's rational, plain speaking that spoke to her. She didn't exactly buy what he was saying but she didn't dismiss it out of hand which is what she was used to doing when Darlene hectored on and on.

"Where'd you learn to do this?" she asked.

"What?"

"Flay your patients alive," Lydia said. "You burn their skin off and then rub some gravel in the red part for good measure."

"Thank you. I think."

The case clock had bing-bonged the half hour and they were already five minutes over. "You're welcome, now let's see if I can ooze myself out of here before you say anything more cruel."

"You're a survivor," he said. "You're think you'll break but you can bend pretty far before that happens."

" Is it possible to ooze to death before you bleed to death?"

"That too," Josh shocked her by patting her lightly and warmly on her upper back. In all the time she had been at Inner Horizons, she could not remember a time when someone had voluntarily touched her. Therapy was therapy; God forbid they made you think they cared.

Huh, she thought as Margaret's van splashed towards her at the pickup bench which was lumpy with clotted snow. That didn't go like I expected.

What was it about Josh that was different from Darlene. In Lydia's heart, not that she was used to looking there for inspiration or self-knowledge, she knew that Darlene cared about her. She knew that Darlene wanted Lydia to "get better" or "self-actualize" or "form an adult identity" or "restrain her id." She couldn't imagine that Josh had anything like Darlene's level of attachment or investment in her well-being. But he had something that Darlene lacked. He listened to her without judgment. She had the feeling that he had met her where she was, no matter how small and grub-like he might have seen her. Even a grub can form into something more than a grub, no matter how slowly.

James thought Josh was okay, Lydia thought slip-sliding to the snow-lumpy bench at the van pick-up stop, he was alright in her book. She saw now that Josh was the reason James had stopped fucking her. It wasn't about her at all. If James was taking care of himself, was it possible that she could take care of herself this way too?

070315 Raccoons Revisited

The only person who could explain the miracle was lying in bed seventeen miles away next to her snoring husband. Hank chuttered, chuckled, whistled, huffed and whiffled in a battery of snores that went up on to a high note, stopped for a long, uncomfortable eternity, then choked into life again like an ailing lawnmower. What Margaret would have said about her neon painted raccoons had to wait until she heard the story first-hand in the morning when she relieved Charleen from night shift.

"I *knew* I hit a couple of those peckerwoods! They just ran so fast, I wasn't sure."

There were only two people on this planet who knew the real reason for the radioactive raccoons. One was lying in the City morgue awaiting an autopsy to discover the cause of his death. The other was lying next to her husband Hank in an upstairs bedroom. Hank was in the middle of a whistling, whiffling snore that went up like a piano scale to a high note, paused at the top most note for an uncomfortable amount of time before the lawnmower of his lungs choked and took another breath. Margaret was thinking about the poor boy she'd tried to revive with chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth rescuscitation to no avail that day. Life was brutal, she was thinking. It would be terrible---no, unbearable---to lose a child, not matter how fucked up and stoned.

She gently nudged Hank to his side by snuggling up to his furnace-warm back and pressing her own bulk against him to encourage him to roll.

His sleep-heavy voice spoke in the darkness. "Was I snoring?"

"Like a grizzly bear. Go back to sleep."

The mystery of the radioactive raccoons would have to wait until the morning shift when Margaret came in early to relieve from a 12-hour night shift. She heard all about the glorious Day-Glo miracle that according to Charleen, a born-again Christian, was almost as good as the Loaves and Fishes.

She didn't have the heart to break it Charleen, a Pentecostalist of the speaking-in-tongues variety, that the only miracle was a screamin' sale at Costco on paintball canisters in neon colors. To convince her, she walked her to the front closet where the paintball rifle was leaned up in the corner next to the Extra Value "Paintball Party Pack" in Day-Glo Dynamite Colors. " Its slogan was written in all the colors of the Day-Glo rainbow: "LIGHT UP YOUR ENEMIES." Margaret thought that was pretty good branding.

Charleen sniffed with disappointment, her faith in miracles sorely tested. "Don't tell the kids," she said. "They need something to believe in."

"Paintball?" Margaret said.

"God, no. I mean God!

Margaret nodded OK feeling sheepish. Far be it from her to replace a belief in miracles with a Costco testimonial.

"Cluck a duck! I knew I clobbered a couple of them. But they were so damned fast, they got away before I could really tell"

"I knew I clobbered a couple of the peckerwoods! How many were up in the tree?"

"Half a dozen, maybe? Charleen screwed up her baby fat face while she started to count on her prettily manicured fingers done up in a different pastel on each digit. "Pink, orange, green, yellow, blue. " She stopped to peer at the box. "Is there a lavender in there? I know there was purple. "

Yes, indeed, there was a Light Up the Sky Lavender and a Nuke the Grapefruit, a bilious yellow hue.

If Margaret hadn't been so tired from her snore-interrupted sleep, she would have laughed at the absurdity. Instead, she walked into the living room where all the girls were still asleep. Sprawled on the floor and mop-headed from sleep, they looked like a litter of overgrown puppies. "Time to rise and shine," Margaret said. "It's the first day of the rest of your lives." That's what her mother had told her when she rolled her out of bed and it seemed just as true then as it did now, only slightly more fraught with anxiety.

> Once the fire was contained and the flurry of activity died down, someone---Rachel didn't know who---shouted out. "What the hell?!"
>
> A light that had been trained on the burning house swiveled away and lit the tall black trees surrounding it. A cone of light played up and down, then settled in one Ponderosa until it stopped and reversed and centered on a neon green masked face.
>
> What? Rachel thought.
>
> A black-eyed, black-masked feral creature peered down at them from the yellow elliptical spot light. It looked like a raccoon. Kind of. But instead of normal black and white stripes, wherever it should have been white glowed green it had been dipped in Day-Glow.
>
> Every fireman it seemed carried a giant Maglite and suddenly more and more lights searched the trees. Radioactive blooms lit up the cloudless night. Cadmium yellow. The raspberry color of radon. Purple pink curium. The bright silver of plutonium. Einsteinium's deep blue of the ocean's darkest depths that resolved to surface blue infused with light. It reminded Rachel of inorganic chemistry class her sophomore year and memorizing the 28 chemical elements in the periodic table with half lives. These elements of memory apparently had developed whole lives because each starburst in the trees now held a masked criminal face and bright black eyes. It was the weirdest thing she'd ever seen.

> "What on God's green earth?" A grizzled fireman next to her whistled.
>
> "Coons?" Somebody breathed.
>
> "What's wrong with them?"
>
> As more and more lights searched the trees like an unchoreographed light show, more feral creatures came into view until in every color of the neon.rainbow bloomed in the tree tops. It seemed like all 28 periodic elements had developed bandit's masked faces and Day-Glo fangs.

> There was a lot of oohing and ahhhhing. Everyone---even Old Girl, whom it was impossible to shock, couldn't take their eyes from the sight.
>
> There was a lot of speculation, mostly among Healing House residents about their origins. "Dr. Hazey's feral children," was a crowd favorite. "This is what happens to you when you get expelled from the Program. You don't go home, you just turn into a rodent.," was another.

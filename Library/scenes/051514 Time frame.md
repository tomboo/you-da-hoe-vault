5/15/14 Time Frame

No title

The chronology work feels oppressive but already, as I start to think about it, I can see a path to breaking up the time frame. Essentially, the chronology establishes the path of time through the novel. Maybe the metaphor of the circular structure can be visualized.

12pm April/Good Friday?

\- Old Girl\'s escape to lie down in the road

- OG opening scene begins-- 12 noon Good Friday at Process Group

- 12 Midnight Good Friday

- Ends-- 4 AM, Saturday Day of [Lazarena\'s]{.underline} rising

One week before

- Rachel has epileptic fit

- Hazey sends Margaret to get shoe

- Rusty picks up garbage at Hazey\'s

- Midnight 4 AM OG out to Highway

Arrange scenes in- Do chronological order

One scenario is to lengthen the time frame to 3-4 weeks, per Waverly\'s suggestion.

Another is to shorten the time frame to 24 hours-- from 10AM on Good Friday during process group →to Lydia and James in baths →to ride up to surprise Lake where they see the moose.

24 is too short for all the stuff that has to take place.

- Midnight Good Friday

- Loops back 4 weeks before the day Rachel

So the [\_\_\_]{.underline} appears to be how I get from the OG\'s process group [reviewing]{.underline}, move then to her escape in forward time to back tracking to all the events that lead up to OG meeting Rusty on the road to kidnap Rachel and his car crash/death.

I have to manipulate time both forward and backward. I start at the end (almost 4 hours before the end) and loop back to 3 weeks before midnight and Good Friday, the day that Hazey comes in wearing one brown and one black shoe that makes him send Margaret to his house where she finds his drug stash and also sees Rusty picking up garbage.

I think it will be clearer to only make one time shift in one POV and maybe that\'s in Margaret\'s POV. The struggle is that I open in OG/Process Group when Rachel has her fit and there are some scenes that require more than 24 hours to evolve.

\*I have to keep careful track of the placement in time so the reader doesn\'t get jerked around and confused. Maybe just get the scene chronology laid out and the pink tape pages so I can see it visually then go back to each scene and establish WHEN the scene is taking place.

Night (OG in process group → escape)

3 weeks before (Margaret to Hazey\'s for shoe)

Dawn (OG back on the road)

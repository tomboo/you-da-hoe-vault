Garbage Man Dies

What is the mid-point of my story. A mid-point is typically a place where a decision is made. It\'s a hinge where the story has to move forward. In my snake story, it\'s the point where Walter starts to experiment with live snakes. Once he has tasted the forbidden fruit he can\'t go back to the pre-\_\_\_ enjoyments \-- too tame. I have multiple characters so whose mid-point is it? My main characters are Margaret and Old Girl and the Garbage Man. Maybe I should write as in a place where they can\'t go back.

Garbage Man up to \_\_\_\_ has been looking without touching. He\'s been spying and the event with Rachel is the event that locks him into grace. He sees her energy with James or they seem friends and he has to move to insert himself between them; he sees James as a threat to his ideal fantasy of a life with Rachel.

Margaret\'s mid-point is finding evidence of Hazy\'s falsification of the records. Is Hazy stupid enough to leave the evidence of his white out date exchange in the garbage?

I don\'t know how to work Old Girl into the story after she lies down in the road unless we go back in time to earlier in the week and try the new girl Rachel arrives at Healing House and has her fit. In Pulp Fiction, you start a scene with Honey Bunny and Pumpkin discussing pros and cons of robbing banks v. liquor stores then they add in \_\_\_\_ a device to take everybody\'s wallets in the diner. \_\_\_\_ time shifts but it\'s not clear when or how it shifts until it circles back to the diner scene at the end so you get a jolt of recognition knowing that everyone in the diner is being stuck up at the point that Vincent and his buddy enter the restaurant.

I feel like Old Girl requires a mid-point or maybe a presence that\'s larger in the story. She\'s at the \_\_\_\_ and then she needs to be at the points of decision. Maybe she has 5 scenes \-- start, end, mid-point, pp1 and pp2. Somehow Old Girl has to move from being convinced she has to die to wanting to live. Her experience with being up close and present at death is the gripping experience that makes her decision explicable but what other things have to happen to earn a death - life change of heart.

Old Girl is still a child and she has dramatic, idealized visions of death, not a realistic understanding of the mysterious \_\_\_\_\_ process. What happens when someone bleeds to death?

Today I\'m writing about the death of Garbage Man.

Old Girl keeps her eyes trained on the light beams that stutter and skip across the Ponderosa Pines that line the road. Her butt is stuck to the road and she can\'t believe the stabs of freezing pain in flesh that should have been numb by now. Just when she thinks the car is upon her \-- too late for last minute braking or a swerve of the wheel \-- a horrific crash reverberates in the stillness. A hail storm of snow and ice shards washes her neck and exposed face and pets her legs and ankles as if someone threw a shovel-full of gravel all over her.

A huge bang. A hailstorm of falling snow and ice. Pine branches, bark wood chips \_\_\_ her one \_\_\_ neck and pit her face like someone has hurled a shovel-full of gravel from across the road.

She scrambles unsteadily to her feet, her legs stiff and awkward with cold and she walks to a gash in the snowbank that ends in a crumple of metal and high beams.

What the fuck? Old Girl \_\_\_\_ I\'m alive, goddammit. Who the fuck is this?

She\'s peering into the crazy glass of a rusted orange truck\'s window and all she can make out is a \_\_\_\_ driver with his arms wrapped around the steering column.

She climbs up the snow berm pushed ten feet in the air by the snow plow and manages to climb and slide down the ditch side of the snow \_\_\_ to the passenger side door. It\'s the truck has taken a full frontal hit into a gigantic Ponderosa Pine that is now leaning backward lit up the high beams of the still running truck. The door wont\' budge so she pushes in the crazed windshield glass with her boots smashing at the glass with her mittens and showering the black \_\_\_ of the driver with glass.

Are you OK? she calls to the dark form but all she hears is panting. High scratchy sounds. A bright penny small gets stronger as she \_\_\_\_\_\_ first into the front seat using her parka to break the \_\_\_\_ mountain \_\_\_\_ of broken glass that clings to the perimeter of the windshield. She flicks the engine off, reaching around the driver and \_\_\_\_ in the dimness for the ignition. It\'s then she realizes the front of the dash is strangely shortened. There\'s barely room for Old Girl, skinny as she is. The steering column of the truck has broken off and the crumpled front end is at most an arm\'s length from her if she wanted to reach out and touch the smoking engine \-- which is now clicking in the intense silence.

A dark, almost black wetness clings to her fingers. It\'s coming from the steering wheel she thinks. Engine fluid? Lubricant? She\'s roused from questioning the source of the dark flow when the driver turns his head and opens his eyes. \"You,\" he says. \"I\'ve been looking for you.\"

\"Do I know you?\" The man is filthy. He\'s grizzled and his hair is dark with grease. She\'s never laid eyes on him unless it\'s in a nightmare she doesn\'t want to remember but it seems impolite to mention it since she\'s in his truck and he hadn\'t invited her to join him.

\"Are you hurt?\" she says.

He\'s got his arms around the steering wheel and she thinks he\'s hugging it until he looks down at the steering column. \"It\'s stuck,\" he says. \"Don\'t move.\"

It dawns on Old Girl then where the dark flow that is dripping quietly on the rubber floor mat is coming from. The steering column is embedded in the man\'s chest. The force of impact with the tree has pushed the engine compartment into the cab which is why both Old Girl and the driver are crammed in a narrow space barely a foot and a half wide.

\"I\'m scared,\" the man says. Old Girl is about to scramble out of the truck thinking she should go for help, but when he holds his hand out, dark and wet, she stops.

\"Let me go for help,\" she says.

He tightens his grip on her fingers but it\'s weak like a child\'s grip and she wants to pull away.

\"Stay,\" he says, as if to convince her. \"I\'m scared. I don\'t want to die.\"

She wants to protest to say, \"You\'re not dying. You\'ll be fine as soon as help comes.\"

He seems to know she\'s full of shit because he fixes her with his eyes. She\'s never seen an expression of such \_\_\_\_\_\_ longing.

\"It won\'t be long.\"

It\'s the last thing he says. He\'s looking at her for a while and then his eyes flicker shut like he\'s falling asleep.

She\'s watching the drips that are falling like an irrigation hose on high until the dripping slows and then there\'s only a pulse of darkness now and then.

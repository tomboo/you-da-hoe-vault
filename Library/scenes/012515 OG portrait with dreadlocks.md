012515 OG portrait with dreadlocks

Her hair was not red-red, it was gingery in color and it sprouted out of her head in a bunch of matted, color-muting dreads. When her hair was straight, it had a coppery glint---Dad was a red head---but in its dreadlock form, the color has been squashed flat like the life had been felted out of it.

She's from Seattle but she got lifted out of her old life and dropped in the mid-West in Naperville, Illnois, by the deus ex machina or the hand of fate that made a geriatric, half-blind driver of a new Tesla mistake the brake for a gas pedal. That's why she was now a fanatic about realism in her fantasies. No magic allowed. No interference by the gods---what God exists that kills a mother and a father and a three-year-old with a Tesla with less than 300 miles on it? The man cried, in the newspaper article Peggy and David hid from her. "I was just taking it out for a spin!"

Old Girl's hair used to be light brown with a hint of red in it. Dad was a red head---she'd inherited his blight of freckles---but the felting and matting process that formed her dreads had squeezed the carroty lights out and now her hair looked dull as cardboard. She also inherited Mom's out-of-proportion build. Narrow in the hips and weirdly chesty which the boys used to like but she'd managed to squash the sex out of herself too with dark shapeless sweatshirts and baggy jeans and a man's Fedora that sucked when it was snowing or freezing cold but looked tight. She'd taken to carrying the fedora in her backpack and wearing a black, pilling ski hat with ear flaps that she pulled down low until she saw herself in a downtown storefront and realized she looked like a long-legged basset hound. What did she care? No one looked at you in Idaho where it started snowing in mid-October and was apparently going to keep on snowing until May.

She could barely read the thermometer nailed to the exterior siding through a wall of fat flakes. Weak sun oozed sulfurous yellow light through the gloom. Hard to tell if it was smog from the pulp mill or the miasma of smell that occasionally swamped them from the dump a few miles down Stranger Road.

Only the locals pronounce it correctly---it was supposed to be Strang-er with a hard g, not "stranger" which is how everybody felt who lived there. Back in the day, the Stranger family had a complex of quonsett huts and white trash trailers and they'd established a dump on the property when they realized the days of dumping shit in the wilderness was getting legislated to an end.

Rustry Stranger

Half the kids thought they lived on Stranger Road, the name that reinforced how strange and isolated they felt. Lots of jokes about Stranger in a Stranger Land. But really, the road was officially pronounced Stranger---with a hard g\-- for the weird and half-feral Stranger clan who'd bought up a bunch of property in the forties and turned half the land into a dump that was partially leased by the County.

010309 At the lake

Angela

Saturday. Outdoor Activity day. Everybody is running around trying to find their expedition wear. Old Girl, ski-hatted, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy down at the front door, feels like a pre-schooler. Where's the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and over her neck? Connor, her brother, refused to wear them in the second grade and even now, old Girl can see the expression of surprise on mom's face. Connor, the family diplomat (she's the family fuck-up), made things right by squeezing Mom around the knees. Would that be so hard? Grab Helen by her padded knees and tell her she's sorry for making a mess of her life? The age of miracles has long passed them by.

The sky is the color of cement. The Suburban hammers along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how Josh tells them to say it). A French name from some ancient trapper who was looking for beavers to slaughter. It's loud in the van, everybody squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other inside. They haven't been let out for Outdoor Activity for more than three weeks because of the relentless snow. People are singing to the radio which is tuned to some country western sob song. Old Girl has never gotten used to the noise. When Mom shipped her out to Idaho after her third suicide attempt, the first thing she understood had been taken away from her was a quiet place to hear herself think.

That's why old Girl sits in the far back, even though it's barf land and cold... At least she's removed from having to make small talk in order to avoid getting a one on peer interaction.

James and Leia already have a one plus a warning for inappropriate touching barely five miles away from the house. Now James is sitting next to Josh in the front seat, so his wandering hands can't reach Leia's crotch. Old Girl is stuck with Princess Leia in the far back. Yesterday Leia forgot to mention sex addict in her litany of behaviors in front of the new girl. Being a nympho was the first thing she usually hit you with. Anorexic and bulimia and cutting were too garden variety to brag about. Did she forget? Luckily, Leia's borrowed somebody's Ipod and is emitting tinny hip-hop rhythms from her ear buds so Old Girl doesn't have to pretend she's interested in how many times Leia has traded oral sex for candy in the past week.

Instead, Old Girl contemplates the white world beyond Inner Horizons which frankly looks pretty much like the view from their living room window at Healing House, with endless blue-tinged trees and a frozen landscape in which nothing moves. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About a mile is Old Girl's calculation. Less if it was snowing.

The leader's plan is to snowshoe up to a mountain lake that feeds into the main lake. It's supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow isn't forecast, but if it does, they'll turn around and hightail it back to the trail head The Suburban is throbbing with noise. Old Girl feels like she's being assaulted. You live with eighteen troubled adolescents and the first thing you realize they've confiscated from you is quiet. Old Girl is used to wearing her Ipod but some ass hole stole it two weeks ago. Another IPod was stolen this week. You didn't catch old Girl whining about it, like Leia, next to her, jerking her head to the beat. Old Girl has darker plans for the thief, involving pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingers the sharp edge of the triangular glass shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tries it, absentmindedly, like nibbling at the edge of a piece of cake. Just enough just to give herself a little taste, until she can have the whole slice.

01182025 Rachel Tells OG About Loss

She saw that the girl wants to talk. She was dying for it, really. And even though OG was halfway out the door, she turns toward the misery, not away from it, like she'd learned early on for self-preservation at Inner Horizons.

\"What happened?\" OG gestured at the half formed grub in the ultrasound's grainy gray center. It looked like a grub, possibly a shrimp with a bowed back, a bobble head, the suggestion of nubs that protrude from a nobby spine. The only thing human about it ws that it looked like it was sucking its thumb.

\"I got pregnant last year. Mom and Dad said I could keep the baby when I told them I got pregnant.\"

OG waited. She heard the tremble in the way she said *they said I could keep it that* foreshadowed loss like her own.

\"I had him at Cedar Sinai . He was perfect. Lots of black, curly hair, big lungs. He was bawling when he came out and they put him on my chest and he went quiet. He opened his eyes.\" She was looking intently at the grainy ultrasound, but during the long pause, it wasn\'t clear that Rachel was even in the room with OG at that moment. She was back in LA in a hospital bed with brown skin, baby boy who gaze up at her at the same time, she gaze down at him. Her voice cracked so she kept going as if she was doing her best to hold it together. \"I fell asleep that way. He did too.\" Rachel\'s long, elegant dancers neck turns as if it\'s on a pendulum. She skewers OG with a brown eyed gaze.

\"He was gone when I woke up. Mom and dad took him away from me. I\'ll never see him again.\"

Bougie knows the nature of loss but even she is shocked breathless with instant instantaneous hurt. \"They snatched him?\"

\"I signed some paper during labor. It seemed like it was for pain meds. Like an epidural? It was the release form they needed to make me give him up.\"

Minutes before, Rachel was a blank slate to old girl. Now she knew everything about her. The scars on Rachel\'s wrist M -- they were vertical like hers in a place where horizontal cutting meant pain that was meant to make you feel not pain you were desperate to get away from.\"

\"So you weren\'t fucking around when you did that.\" Old girl held her own wrists up to show Rachel the narrow vertical slashes they shared.

Rachel shook her head, no. \"My brother... Found me. He thought he was saving me.\"

\"My aunt did too.\" Old girl laughs, at first she\'s laughing to herself. Then belatedly she includes Rachel. \"Jesus. The halt and the Lemm, bonding overkill scars.\"

\"Promise me you won\'t offer yourself tonight,\" Rachel said.

\"Why?\"

\"I don\'t want you on my conscience too. Losing my own baby is one thing. Losing a roommate looks like...

They both say it together \"... Carelessness!\" 0G snorts and actually laughs loudly like a hyena, and both of them have to cover their heads in their blankets to muffle the sound that sounds eerily like crying.

OG laughed so hard she had to wipe a tear from one eye with the corner of her dinosaur bedsheet. \"Why do you know that Oscar \"?\"\"

Rachel says, \"losing one parent looks like misfortune. Losing another one looks like carelessness.\" I don\'t know it just seemed like it might come in handy. She got a mean look on her face and said, \"I might need it in court someday when I off mom and dad.\" After this exchange, it was like the two of them had something settled between them. They were not friends. But they weren\'t enemies either which counted as friendship in our horizons where it was always every man for himself.

The discussion ended with Rachel scrambling around in drawer after drawer on her side of the room. She was emptying all the pockets of the amazing amount of clothes she had brought. Then she went to her desk and found a piece of paper and wrapped it around the bills before she handed it to O\"It\'s not enough to get you to the Bahamas, but I\'ll get you further than \$79.\"

OG said, \"you can\'t go with me.\"

\"I know one nut at a time is enough trouble.\"

\"I\'ll pay you back.\"

\"Tell me the story of how you survive and I\'ll consider it paid.\"

When OG opens the paper wrapped wad of money, she found more than \$600 in the stash from Rachel\'s various pockets. She didn\'t notice that there was handwriting on the paper wrap till after she counted the bills.

\"You said you wouldn\'t off yourself tonight that promise covers tomorrow too.\" OG put the note in Gabe\'s hat flap for safekeeping. It was like the sign that she liked at the Wallingford fruit store that kept her coming back. \"Bananas on sale tomorrow.\"

When OG finally thought to count the money, she would find \$600 and a handwritten note on the paper that the bills were wrapped in. \"The pinky swear covers tonight which includes tomorrow or I\'ll come after you and offer you myself.\" It was hanging by her computer when she wrote the final line of the story setting in Idaho.

When you\'re stuck on a naughty problem, it\'s better to just pull on any old strand and see where it leads to. Eventually, as you follow the strand inward, you ease around the bump or choose another way or find the one that has to be teased out and patiently released from the place where you were stuck. You follow a thread in this way, and you pick it gnats and birds that are bothersome or somehow obscure the real problem. It\'s the writing itself that flattens and length on the strand you\'re following until you can see if it\'s a through line or just an orphan that\'s interesting but doesn\'t lead to the big burly mess that clog is the story.

Right now I\'m working on OG\'s through line. For the longest time, she\'s been a dreadlocked, matted not of tangles that obscured my ability to see the problem of her grief and how she could bear to go on. There is no one grand/of the silver scissors that saves her there\'s just a blockage, a big black, narrow lump that she has to painstakingly work through to find a way past the darkness of catastrophe so she can turn toward the light. The bomb that shoved her in the black hole was instant instantaneous. She found herself in it when she woke up without a mother, without a father, without a four year old baby brother that she still loves fiercely. For the longest time, even the thought of all that bubbling laughter being turned into a scream, haunted her in her dreams.

The climb out of the hole is long and arduous. She grows by tiny footholds and squeezes along dark narrow passages that seem to have no end until something small and seemingly innocuous pushes her from behind like the hug from Margaret when she\'s so sick with strep throat it feels like she\'s going to get her wish for death by the miracle of bacteria or virus.

I have no idea why I can write and feel my characters are feeling in some kind of wondrous process that bubbles up from my subconscious. My feelings become their feelings in whatever circumstances that changed their lives in an instant loss.

Maybe what I have that many people don\'t is a direct avenue to my heart through the pen that has allowed my true emotions to bleed onto the page for all these years. I\'ve never thought my talent was special because it\'s been a part of me since I was a little girl, and I used to imagine and playback stories in my mind all the time.

You get better at opening the hearts door the more you do it, I see.

I\'ve also worked hard to develop my sense of drama and rising action to tighten the piano wire of tension. It always amazed me how Nina could not -- maybe would not -- understand how dramatically flat two people drinking tea were in her stories. She could rocket along pretty well with a story and the tension would be rising, and then boom, the china cups were lifted from the cupboard, they were rinsed out with hot water, and the teaspoons were a-clink while her scene died of inertia.

Comparison isn\'t helpful. I have my gift; Nina has hers. It\'s not germane to my story that I can see.

Is it?

I\'m wrestling internally with the story problem of how OG manages to convince Rachel not to run with her.

If they were allowed a hot pot in their rooms maybe. But that's too dangerous for the self harmers who never met a heating element, they could resist burning themselves with. and parentheses they could drink a cup of cocoa together. OG would listen to Rachel story of loss and then she would tell Rachel what happened to the happy family of four with three of them dead and buried.

Ha, Nina, you\'d be proud of me: turning your tea, drinking on its head and making a scene of possible connection.

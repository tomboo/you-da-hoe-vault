020225 Esto Perpetua argument for Youdaho between James and Reza

02022025 Esto Perpetua Reza and James 

 

In Reza[']{dir="rtl"}s running argument to change Idaho to YouDaHo,  he said, ["]{dir="rtl"}The Idaho Legislature was already onto this in 1890." 

["]{dir="rtl"}How so?" James knew it was trouble to egg him on, but he bit. 

["]{dir="rtl"}The state motto is Esto Perpetual" 

["]{dir="rtl"}And\...?" 

["]{dir="rtl"}It means [']{dir="rtl"}let it be perpetual.[']{dir="rtl"} Or [']{dir="rtl"}it shall last forever,[']{dir="rtl"} take your pick. Way back in 1890, the old farts could see YouDaHo coming." 

["]{dir="rtl"}You know you[']{dir="rtl"}re full of bullshit?" James said. 

["]{dir="rtl"}Sure, that just means some of it will stick."

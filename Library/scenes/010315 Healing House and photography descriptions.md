010315 Healing House and photography descriptions

OG

The orange shag rug was matted and stained in places. Kids were continually spilling stuff or wiping boogers on it. On one memorable day last week, it had been puked, peed and bled on so why the hell would they replace it, when only more was to come?

All the couches were lumpy and overstuffed, the kind that invited you to sink into their depths, then wouldn't let you up to escape.

The Healing House living room was heavy on seating and low on lighting. You could talk yourself to death there but God forbid you read something that you might learn from.

On one wall there were all kinds of portraits of old timey people who all looked at you with withering stares, like they were mad at being forced to listen to all the psychobabble. Old Girl suspected that people who had to sweep the streets with a hand made broom or carried one hundred pounds of bricks on their shoulders would have not much sympathy for all the whining that went on at Healing House.

Old Girl had no idea where the photos came from or who the people were. Dr. Hazey\-- the founder of Inner Horizons---distant relatives?

Old Girl had no idea who the photos were of or where they had come from. Dr. Hazey, the founder's, distant relaetives? Maybe they were old patients from back in the day. "This is what happens to you when you leave the program" was the message. If you're lucky enough to be let out, you go back to some other time in a different life where you are sentenced to carrying bricks or sweep streets with a home made broom or you become a rotund pastry chef whipping egg whites for all eternity. AKA not much worse than being stuck here.

Dr. Hazey

Hazey's theory was that all his in-patient residences should be like homes but the theory fell apart when it came to the people on the walls. They weren't like anybody normal people could relate to. They were completely unknowable strangers living their own lives in some distant past and the expressions on their faces said, "you don't know me even though you see me every day."

Only Margaret knew anything about the photographs. To everybody in the program, they were just like an odd wallpaper choice, about as unremarkable as those happy family photos that came with fancy photo frames at the store. In actuality, they were valuable photos Dr. Hazey inherited from the German side of his family.

His ex-wife was into decorator art at their McMansion back when she gave a shit about the marriage. Her criteria for art was that it needed to match the drapes and the upholstery and the rugs so those old time staring souls who seemed to look at you and ask "Who am I?" creeped her out. Oddly enough, that was why all the art at Dr. Hazey's personal home was faux and everything that hung on the walls at Healing House was real.

Arbus

The only thing distinctive about the in-patient residences were the photos. Hazey's father had been a doctor and they'd lived across the street in Westchester, New York, from a fashion photographer and her husband. His father bought the woman's photographs to be nice to her, he'd said, but Hazey decided 68 photos purchased over about three years of being neighbors constituted a little more than niceness.

He'd found them neatly preserved in black photo boxes, carefully signed on the matte, and separated by pristine backing papers that protected one black-and-white image from the others. He distantly remembered a somewhat elegant, dark-haired woman with a cigarette omnipresent in her hand in their old family room, her husband talking over her and tending her martini glass, while she observed the ebb and flow of his parent's cocktail parties without joining in.

He couldn't believe the value of the odd, disjointed images that his father had kept boxed up for years in the basement. He doubted they'd had an affair---at least, a physical, touching affair of the flesh. But the sheer number of images his father acquired over the years looked very much like an affair of the heart. His father was completely and utterly smitten by the strange, off-kilter way that Mrs. Arbus saw the world, the careful way she posed her subjects, emphasizing their strangeness and while showing how much she valued them.

Maybe Hazey's father recognized a kindred spirit. He was a strange, secretive man, prone to long silences and dim affect which Hazey recognized in his psych rotation in college as depression masquerading as work-aholism.

When Alma moved out in what she said was a trial separation but Hazey understood as a permanent solution to their martial estrangement, he'd been near the end of remodeling Healing House as a treatment facility. Under no circumstances would Alma live with the Arbus photographs at home. She said they were crazy enough to make her crazy if she looked at them too long. So he decided to hang them on the living room walls in a gallery. There was room for a whole wall of them and besides, he reasoned, wouldn't Mrs. Arbus's sense of dislocation and life on the margins be centering for patients who might relate to them.

Old Girl's reaction to Arbus

Nobody agreed on much at Healing House but every body---therapists, patients, kitchen staff, cleaning people, even visiting parents---agreed that the photographs on the walls were weird.

It was all photography. Black-and-white portraits, all ov odd, crazing looking people whom you'd only find in a crazy house.

It would be years later, when Old Girl was at a New York museum and thumbing through a monograph of 20^th^ Century photography when she recognized the photo of a giant bending over two dazed-looking elderly people in a normal sized living room. She remembered puzzling over it in the Healing House living room. Pages later, she found the image she'd always contemplated in the john: a pair of dark-haired twins, eerily dressed in matching white collars and black velvet dresses. Two exact replica little girls, standing side-by-side and staring at you as if they wanted to ask you a question you couldn't know the answer to.

There were three couches in an off-kilter semi-circle. They all had lumpy and soft cushions that invited you to sink deep but wouldn't let you up again without a struggle.

Margaret on Couches

All the couches were over-sized and cumbersome to move. Margaret bemoaned getting a vacuum around them to any one who would listen. If Hazey wanted a gathering place where everyone could be together, what the hell was wrong with the dining room? Or cheap folding chairs that could be set up and put away when they weren't in use instead of filling the living room with upholstery that looked like people had died on it?

HAZEY

Two of the couches came from different phases of Alma's decorating history. The lightweight floral chintz, a slick fabric that Hazey always slid off of reminded him of their early marriage when Alma was into "pops" of color that were like their multiple explosions of vicious fighting that ended sex. The big textured popcorn weave monstrosity that was currently sprouting a reddish stain that was either blood or grape juice, brought back her faux natural phase when all shades of brown---buff! beige! bark! bracken! oyster! -- made him hungry for oatmeal. His favorite couch---because it had been great for napping---was the one that came from his post-doc days, compliments of his Alma's parents redecorating before they got married. It didn't match a single thing he could point to in the room. It was a scruffy orange and green woolen plaid with one cat-scratched arm that erupted stuffing, a memorial to a long-dead Fluffy. A night or two after they drove a U-Haul truck cross-country from Boston to Cour D'Alene, he'd let the kitten out in the yard to pee where a coyote ate her. Welcome to Idaho.

Even when he'd told Alma that the Arbus photos were valuable (thank God he hadn't said how valuable), and she'd refused to allow them in their later marriage McMansion. "These people look nuts!" she'd said. "Don't you get enough of that at work?"

So Dr. Hazey had them all framed the same way in heavy gilt frames and chose the portraits to be hung first at Healing House and later on, as the program grew, in the girls bungalow and the boy's bungalow, then Stabilization House out onStockyard Road, and finally, a Victorian furbelowed two story ex-boarding house that all the therapists now used for offices. Sixty-eight photos provided a lot of décor. After the first year or two, the Arbus images became nothing more than wall paper unless, he supposed, you were new to the program and they subtly reminded each patient that they were no more nuts than the people on the wall.

In the living room where the windows faced east, the snow lay sun-spangled on the lawn as if someone had cast diamonds all over it. The sky was a headache-blue, so bright it made the fir trees that ringed the Healing House yard look black and impenetrable. It almost looked inviting, unless you read the thermometer attached to the exterior wall. Minus 10 degrees and dropping.

The Healing House floor, gray rough slate striated with orange, looked warm and inviting until you walked on it and it was like skating on ice. Three oversize couches faced each other in an off-kilter circle headed by a tall wingback chair that pulled the circle out of true. This was reserved for the therapist on duty and whoever sat in it over-weighted the peer group circle with a passle of advanced degrees and a shit-load of detentions and punishments if you acted out.

The Healing House slate floor was a warm gray color striated with flaming orange. It looked like it had been chosen to look cheery and inviting but it held onto the cold like an ice rink. Three overstuffed couches faced each other in an irregular circle pulled further out of true by a tall, wingback chair reserved for the therapist on duty. Today it was occupied by Darlene, pinch-faced in a pink pantsuit that was rucked up around her doughy middle and revealed swollen ankles in support hose. Long suffering Darlene, though she'd only been at Inner Horizons for less than a year.

A bank of bookshelves built into one wall held a million game boards, Parcheesi parts, Chinese marbles, card decks, Monopoly bills, Lincoln logs mixed up with Legos of every size and more puzzles than a game store, most of them missing pieces. Beyond the circle of talking heads, the sixteen seat dining table occupied the whole dining room. All the chairs were high-backed Shaker oak chosen for their prison ambiance, Old Girl assumed, since they were hell to sit on for longer than thirty minutes.

Through the swing door that led to the kitchen, Gretchen, the Head Nutritionist was lecturing Margaret, the Day Supervisor. They were putting away breakfast dishes, clattering pans and dishes and cutlery, planning the next fiasco of a meal. Well, Gretchen would be planning to fuck it up and Margaret would be trying to talk her out of it, hence the ratcheting volume of an argument that pinged against all the stainless steel in the industrial kitchen like ricocheting bullets.

Opposite the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves was a long gallery wall chock-a-block with black-and-white portraits of old time people. Peasant women in voluminous black skirts and scarves and shawls, a bricklayer carrying a gigantic load of bricks on his shoulders, a farmer with a grim, unsmiling wife and two small girls in matching blond braids, a policeman with a fantastically wide mustache twice the size of his face. Old Girl never tired of imagining who these people were. Earlier failures of the Inner Horizons treatment program? Dr. Hazey, the founder's, distant relatives? Object lessons for current patients? A collection of serial murderers or perhaps, the victims? Today, she was turning over the idea in her mind that Hazey, who was also her personal therapist, had a garage sale obsession and haunted every estate sale and antique shop in Couer D'Alene, snapping up old family portraits other people had discarded. Dr. August Sanders Hazey, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Inner Horizons psychiatric treatment program for troubled adolescents and young adults, had no family. She'd never seen any evidence of one, except for a rumor about an ex-wife. Maybe the photos on the wall were Hazey's made-up fantasy forbearers. It was Idaho where people seemed to land in the wilderness as loners and stayed that way into perpetuity.

Hazey's POV

Even when he told Alma that the Sanders photos were valuable, she wouldn't have them in the house. She and her decorator wanted faux-art that picked up the colors of the couch and the "windowscapes" formerly known as drapes. So Hazey had 124 of them framed in somber filigreed gilt and they now hung on every conceivable bare wall, first in an imposing gallery that took up one wall of Healing House's living room, then later, as the Inner Horizon's empire grew, all the public spaces in the bungalow for boys (Calm Cottage) and the two-story Victorian boarding house for girls (Serenity House). Most recently, they'd sprung up like a silent army in the squat two story commercial building he'd bought to house his therapists and admin staff. The official name for what he thought of as Command Central was Orderly Manor, but now everybody, including himself, called it O-Man.

August Sanders Hazey

In his corner office on the second floor, Hazey had hung two of his favorites on the north wall, away from the sun, where he could look at them when he was in session or talking on the phone at his walnut desk.

A young man weighed down by an enormous load of bricks faced him. The bricks were triple or quadruple stacked on a piece of plywood. Did they even have plywood then? Hazey had no idea, so maybe it was a thin, planed board. It looked like the camera had picked up the minute vibration of the weight on the man's shoulders, as if he was straining to hold up the load while the shutter pulsed. Hazey felt a communal sense of burden every time he looked at his debt load on his balance sheet. The man's expression was polite and patient; Hazey had the sense he was waiting for the person behind the shutter to be done so he could carry the bricks up the ladder and go back for another load. Maybe he should buy the farm house out beyond the dump that Marvin Oppenheimer, his real estate agent, had shown him last week. He focused on the brick, that minuscule multiple exposure of the moving weight and thought maybe not. If you piled one more brick on, would it topple his load?

He let his eye move on to the restful scene of three natty young men in dapper dark suits and creased hats. They were leaning on rough walking sticks in the middle of a country road, the dark hills of dusk in the distance. He'd looked up the title of the photograph once--- Three Farmers on the Way to a Dance---so he knew they were dressed up for some village festivity. Three young men looking for girls to dance with? They were clearly at their ease, away from their farm work, dressed up and clean, with their pants pressed and fashionable, except for their home made, hand-carved walking sticks. It was just a moment, caught in the fading light of a fading day but the portrait had always held some kind of promise that Hazey liked. These idlers, they were on their way somewhere, the party they'd dressed so carefully for beckoning and yet they were politely waiting for the man behind the lens\--Hazey imagined him fiddling behind the hood of some giant box camera\-- waiting for him to be done with his business so they could go on to the dance. Hazey was always feeling the same way. When would his polite duties be done so he could get on with the party?

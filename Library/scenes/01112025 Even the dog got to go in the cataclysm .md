01112025 Even the dog got to go in the cataclysm

Even the fucking dog go to go in the cataclysm. How fair was that? The whole family obliterated in an instant by a senior citizen who forgot the difference between the gas pedal and the brake?

In the early days after the accident, her mind refused to think about the Lous metal bang and the pressured tire whining when Delores, the old family van, resisted being pushed with her whole family inside on a train track in the path of an oncoming locomotive. Aunt Peggy who read the coroner's report said death had been instantaneous. In OG's nightmares for months afters, the time between the first scrunch of metal when the old man hit them and the roar of the oncoming train tripled into an air horn drowning out Mom's gasp and Dad's "fuck!!' and Dr. Watson's howl that ended in a crash that wouldn't stop crashing?

If she wanted to be with them, fine, her imagination said at night. Here you go, you with your finely tuned creativity and your ability to slow down time and sound until it stopped.

Maybe death was instantaneous for those she loved but it reverberated and rang and hammered and rampaged till WHANG! She jolted awake as if she'd been shot in the heart with adrenaline and regret.

Why hadn't she gone in the van with them so they could all explode in flames at once, if that waste be their fate?

She was 15 when the accident happened and who knows if grief itself or hormones propelled her into the deep freeze of despair over the following months as it gott worse and worse and more hopeless until she moved in to live with Peg and David in their farmhouse outside Peoria. She left Seattle in the dead of an urban winter and arrived at a farm house in a snow-covered cornfield visited only by ravens and screaming, rapacious starlings and a herd of dairy cows. She spent the first year in some numb, stumbling blind state, wondering why she was the only one left. Somewhere during that frozen, barely-able-to-move state, it just seemed like death was preferable to being among the living dead in Peoria.

That's when her suicide attempts started. but she had a run of the most horrible, fucked up terrible luck that kept saving her from herself. She let herself fall out of Uncle David's truck on the way to her first day of high school and only got a broken shoulder and full-body road rash instead of the relief of being crushed by his wheels. When the charge nurse was picking gravel out of her legs and back, the woman who was a friend of David's an Pegg's, told her if she ever tried that again, she would kill OG herself.

Later the same year, she swallowed the contents of clean-living Aunt Peg's medicine cabinet, only to get her stomach pumped of lethal amount of Ex-Lax. The same fucking nurse at the rural hospital was on-duty and she said, "You again! Aren't you grateful for what Peggy and David Coburn have done to save you!!?"

Well, yes, in the abstract, but in reality, because David and Peggy were Christian Evangelicals who went to Church twice a week and wanted her to memorize from the Old Testament to calm herself down and understand that God had a plan, not so much. Everyone else at in her high school classes had intact parents and sisters and brothers and family dogs that didn't howl in their dreams at night.

When she added it all up, she was glad that Peggy and David wanted her to live but really, she didn't have any heart to join them.

A year later, when she got smarter, she slit her wrists vertically, not like the dilettante cutter in the Program named Lydia who was, sitting across from her with horizontal scars on her wrists because she liked to cut to feel something. This was in contrast to OG who cut deep to feel nothing but dead.

On the one- year anniversary of the train accident, Aunt Peggy and Uncle David knew they were way out of their God-fearing depths.

That's when OG found herself removed from the corn fields of Peoria and immured in the winter wheat fields of Idaho. She was 16 going on 70 still looking for a way to go AWOL from a life too shattered to scrape up from the unrecognizable viscera and blood and brains left behind.

Everybody in Process Group had already heard OG'S sad story. She'd heard all their sad stories too: how Reza vibrating next to her like a piano wire blew up his Dad's Mercedes RV in the Hamptons during his first attempt to make meth; how James, the Malibu surfer who had an equal jones for basketball and weed and alcohol and can't remember how he crashed his car in Topanga Canyon and killed somebody with him; how Dani, the pole dancing sociopath of the group had bankrupted her parents who were school teachers with her Program fees; how Lydia, the cutter next to her, augmented her bulimia and sex addiction next to her and broke up her mother's second marriage by sleeping with her step father. Every body in the rough circle of four well worn couches and a few chairs had a sad story that they all knew backwards and forwards, except for the new girl, Rachel, who'd arrived last week.

This Rachel is the only black person kin the Program unless you counted Reza who was SE. Asian by way of Manhattan and convinced that people in Couer D'Alene, Idaho, hated his brown, ugly skin.

James, seated next to him, was fond of saying, "No, they don't hate your skin color. They only hate your zits, so why don't you wash your face and stop whining?"

If OG had a magic wand, she would guess that Rachel was slated to read that instrument of torture at Inner Horizons called an Accountability Letter to the group. Every person who graduated from the Program had to read a letter to your peers about all the shit you'd done to your parents, your friends and yourself IRL. Your peers at Inner Horizons were supposed to help you "process" all your heinous behavior i.e. ruthlessly root out any lies or obfuscations or cover-ups because let's face it, everyone who came to Inner Horizons was a pro at lying to themselves.

If you lied to the group, they could smell it on you like rat poison. After the gauntlet of your peers who had behaved exactly like you except in a few horrendous specifics, reading your Accountability Letter to your parents as atonement for all the fuck ups that sent you to

fucked up psychiatric treatment outside bum-fuck Couer D'Alene, was supposed to be easy.

OG remembers a day when she's about 13 or 14. Dad is driving her to school and they get stopped at the Aurora Bridge where cops are trying to talk a jumper from her precarious perch on a railing. A dark haired woman clings to a guy wire above her and threatens to let go if he comes closer. OF can't hear the conversation from the far lane. But she can see the woman's white knuckles that float like the wings of a dove when she lest go. No one has time to reach out a hand for her, only the wind alive inher hair shows that nanosecond of joy.

041917 Lydia beats OG to the money

Lydia. Always a step ahead when it came to herself! Damn. She could have used that money to add to her minuscule stash of cash. \$36.58! She\'d sold her North Face jacket worth \$250 bucks for \$25 to an Indian girl in her English class. She looked like she needed it more than Old Girl did.

Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia smoothly palmed the twenty and moved off toward the bathroom by the kitchen. She bumped James in the butt on her way past.

Old Girl sighed. Another sexcapade in the making. Did James and Lydia think people were blind to their hook-ups? Apparently.

James was good looking except for the man bun. Blond. Blue-eyed. A carefully cultivated surfer dude look that was hard to maintain in Idaho where everyone blimped around in puffy down and wool hats yanked down to the cheek bones. But Old Girl felt nothing when she looked at him. She existed in a deep freeze, completely insulated from human warmth. No interest in body-to-body touching what so ever. All feeling\--good and bad\--had fled with her family. Absence didn\'t make the heart grow fonder, in her experience; it made her heart grow colder as in a block of ice.

Darlene and Bruce, the driver, aided by Margaret, scurried around getting the girl loaded into the van. They\'d decided to drive her to the emergency room at Kootenai General. Faster than waiting for an ambulance to drive 15 miles out to Healing House, then drive another 15 miles back before they got her into the hospital.

In all the hustle and hoo-ja relating to Rachel, Darlene forgot her purse.

Old Girl spotted it next to the wingback chair where she\'d been sitting at Process Group. She reached to grab it but Lydia scooped up the bag first.

The little shit!

Lydia plucked a \$20 bill Old Girl had spotted in the wallet and palmed it at the same time she called out loudly, \"Darlene! Your bag!\"

Old Girl could have used the money to add to her minuscule stash of cash. She had painstakingly over months amassed a grand total of 37 dollars and 51 cents. How that was going to get her to Seattle, she had no idea.

In the wallet, a twenty dollar bill peeked out a green corner. Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia plucked and palmed the bill in one smooth motion while she called out loudly, \"Darlene! Your purse!\"

Darlene rushed back in the living room and took the bag, thanking Lydia profusely. Lydia smiled beneficently and flashed Old Girl a middle finger behind her back. So much for adding to her minuscule stash of cash she was planning to run with. How she was going to get to Seattle on thirty-four dollars and thirty-one cents, she had no clue.

OLD GIRL HEARD THE BOOMING BEFORE she saw it. A tinkling sound like breaking glass. Thrashing and crashing, accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl raced ahead down the blue-shadowed trail that descended to a lake, followed by James who put on speed coming up on her like a sprinter. A thunderous crack. Then came an odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Old Girl had ever heard.

By the time she got to the lake, the moose was already tiring. Cloven hoof prints lead to a jagged-edged dark pool a hundred yards from the lakeshore. A moose floundered in roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. The moose would lunge forward. Its massive wither heaved up onto the shelf and then the ice would break off with its weight. Every time it managed to get up, another ledge of ice would shear off. The black water was dotted with snow clumps that shuddered and bobbed when the creature fell back into the black water and started swimming in circles.

"Holy shit!" James' voice was awestruck.

"What can we do?" Rachel's usually low voice broke high and squeaky. Even in Old Girl's astonishment at the sight of the struggling moose, she registered the fracture. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind as the moose made another attempt to lunge forward. Its huge antlers raked the snow and its rolling eyes started in terror when it fell.

"Get a stick!" Old Girl clawed at a clump of downed alder trapped in the ice at the shore. She got both hands on a branch and started jumping on it to try to break it out of the ice.

"What good is that? What's it going to hold on with?" James cried.

"Maybe we can get a branch under it. Lever it up somehow." Old Girl beckoned to Rachel and Rachel started jumping with her until the branch splintered and broke.

Even with James and Rachel stomping with her on a stand of alder scrub they couldn't break off a sturdy enough tree to hold its weight. Without an axe or a saw, the green trees defeated them. They had a surprisingly robust will to survive to their own. Was that the way to make it through this life? Put down strong enough roots to survive any storm?

Old Girl hauled a big ass branch toward the hole in the ice but before she got ten steps out on the ice, she felt an ominous crack underfoot. She hesitated. The crack zipped behind and in front of her and the ice she was standing on started to sink. An inch of water started to flow towards her from the shoreline. In seconds, her boot toes were submerged and she felt a spring and wobble underneath her as if the ice was a moving deck.

James, who was a tree length behind her, immediately dropped to his belly. \"Get down!\" he yelled. \"Spread out your weight."

His tone was so loud, so strident, Old Girl obeyed instantly. She felt the spongy ice seem to bounce and flex when her weight spread out enough to allow it to give without breaking.

The tree she\'d thrown out in front of her was pointing toward the dark water which was flowing on top of the ice toward her. It was coming from the hole of darkness where the moose was swimming.

\"Shimmy backwards,\" James ordered. "Now."

Old Girl was crab-walking backwards on her hands and knees---she didn't bother trying to face the shore for fear that ice would give way--- when the moose made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back into churning water choked with floating ice. As they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its shoulders and withers slowly sank under dark surface, Rachel saw the candelabra points of its antlers fired by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above blue-black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly out of sight, the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-clotted hole.

My God, Old Girl thought. Oh my God.

By the time Bruce and the rest of the group caught up to them on the lakeshore, the water had stopped spinning and the snow clumps barely shivered. Bruce immediately started barking at Old Girl, James and Rachel.

"You were supposed to stay together!" he cried, in a pissed off voice. "Why'd you separate from the group?"

Bruce slapped James with his second demerit of the day. Old Girl got her first demerit of the week. Rachel was awarded her first demerit ever. He cited them all with "poor peer interactions and not following rules." Inner Horizons' arcane system of "consequences" involved numbers from one to four for everything from household chores to therapeutic progress. Murder was the only infraction Old Girl was aware of that was not accounted for on the demerit list.

Rachel started to tell the group about the moose drowning and Old Girl shut her up by slipping sideways on her snow shoes, nearly knocking her to the ground.

"What the hell*?"* Rachel said.

James turned away from the group, busy inspecting the clump of sad aspen saplings that they hadn't been able to uproot. Old Girl stared at Rachel without expression until she took the hint.

"Jesus, watch where you're going!" she said, yanking her basket out from under Old Girl's foot.

Bruce pointed out the jagged hole in the lake like Mr. Wilderness. "Looks like something fell through. Can anybody in the group guess what?"

Old Girl, James and Rachel were silent while the group made a bunch of stupid guesses.

Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big the hole is. You can see its claw marks." James rolled his eyes. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation," he said.

Dani noticed the three-pronged tracks and thought maybe a deer fell through.

Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, and zebras, along with Godzilla and Dr. Hazey,.

By then, a few light snowflakes began to drift over them sideways. Thus ended the nature lesson.

Bruce called for an about-face before the snow got serious. They were all to hightail it back to the Suburban, toot-sweet. Bruce, a native of Sand Point, Idaho, had some weird local sayings. He yelled at Dani on the ride back to Healing House to shut her pie hole. Not a phrase that Old Girl had ever heard in Portland. Score another for Youdaho.

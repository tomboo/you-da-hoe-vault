1^st^ Writing Class

May Sarton writes novels so she can answer a question.

What question are you trying to answer by writing this novel?

My question is how do new young people on the cusp of maturity make their life stories that move then into functioning adults. It\'s a time of confusion. My characters all have strikes against them \-- bulimia, sex addition, drugs, \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_, suicidal \_\_\_, major depression \-- and they all have to decide how to live.

I\'m questioning how people get up in the morning and live with themselves after horrible behavior. I want to know how it is that some people grow by dribs and spurts and others blast through and some remain stuck in stasis. They all have to decide how to live.

What makes a great novel?

I like a good story where things change from beginning through middle to the end.

I like funny tragic characters in life-and-death situations who approach the \_\_\_\_\_ with a mordant sense of humor.

I like an interplay between nature and my characters. Nature is always in the background making commentary on the action.

I like novels that have an archetypal underpinning. Not sure what mine could be for NaNo.

I like novels that include a love story.

I llike novels that are willing to piss and shit and misbehave \-- no preciosity.

Chris Baty says to form this list and put it where you can see it.

What bores and depresses you in a novel?

I have novels where nothing happens.

I am bored by clichés, by black-and-white characters who have only good and bad characteristics when we\'re all mixtures of both.

I hate novels that are small in time. Trivial pursuits is for \_\_\_ drinkers not writers.

I hate novels that don\'t add up and feel like the author is pulling the strings.

I don\'t like coincidences or deus ex machina; action needs to feel inevitable based on what the character wants.

I can\'t stand novels that don't have an active, interesting villain.

Write one sentence: what does your character do

Research your character

What does he/she do and for what purpose

are poorly educated middle aged woman helpers \_\_\_\_\_ every crazy psychotic kid at Healing House with her common sense approach to life and in so doing, earns a full-time job with benefits to feed her family.

A depressed and suicidal 17-year-old who keeps trying to kill herself finally turns toward life when she witnesses a man\'s death in a car crash.

A spoiled rich kid with a drug habit forgives himself for accidentally causing a girl\'s death.

The complications that result.

Margaret the part-time housekeeper, fights with the registered dietician cook about starving and poisoning the kids in the name of nutrition.

Margaret takes over the kitchen in a bloodless coup and teaches the kids to make mac \'n\' cheese and brownies.

Margaret discovers that Dr. Hazey is extending departure dates in order to supply himself with drugs and she uses this information as leverage.

Margaret takes over as the cook at the \_\_\_\_\_ of a registered dietician and hands Hazy an oatmeal cookie.

Kathy Ingerman/Snowflake method:

Take each complication then write a page on each

Unwitting action

Readers love to see characters get in trouble.

Look at how way down young girl, Jess who says everything she shouldn\'t

Character\'s Name: Old Girl

One sentence summary of what happens to character in the story (his/her storyline):

She keeps trying to kill herself in ever inventive ways and she finally chose life over death.

What does the character want?

old Girl wants to escape life in any way possible.

I wonder if I can cut up \_\_\_\_\_ and Old Girl\'s scenes into small parts and treat from them the story. Structural issue of having to pulp fiction cliff hanger at beginning that circles around to the same scene at the end.

In Atkinson novels, Jackson Brodie is the main character, both hero and anti-hero. Characters pivot around him.

Could I work out Old Girl\'s story so that she is the heroine and the pivot point like Jackson?

What prevents Old Girl from killing herself?

The rules and regs of the treatment program keep Old Girl from killing herself. People rat on her. people save her. She is young and inept and fucks up her attempts at suicide. Her aunt and uncle make her feel guilty and tether her to this world.

What is Old Girl\'s epiphany? When Old Girl runs out to the garbageman\'s truck and wrenches open the door, she realizes in a nano-second that the man with the steering column in his chest is really dying. He doesn\'t want to die. He says, \"Help me. Stay with me.\" And she holds his hand as he bleeds to death.

Write a dialogue with each character.

Who are you?

Tell me about your life.

My name is Hank Harrow. I pick up garbage for a living. Mostly I pick and collect things that interest me. Like today I found a raccoon coat and a wooden toy boat with a set of animals that looked like a rat chewed off their faces. I have a bunch of cubby holes in a big container I bought at a salvage yard. The shelves came from people\'s thrown away book cases, none of that Ikea new shit for me. Anything that strikes my interest, I hang on to. I think I\'ve got 100 shaving brushes maybe 4-500 combs, some with people\'s old hair oil clogged in the tines and I can still smell them in what they\'ve left behind.

What made you a collector.

In \_\_\_\_ Idaho, we never had a pot to piss in. No toys, no new clothes, half the time I wore somebody\'s old shoes that were too big for me and I liked to chew on crayons because I like the taste of wax. My old man drank himself to death after my mom ran off and I just fended for myself by grabbing anything I found.

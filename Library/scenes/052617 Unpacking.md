052617 Unpacking

\"Shit the bed!\" Old Girl cried. A suitcase the size of an elephant blocked the way to her side of the room. \"They NOT making this a triple!

Old Girl thought that Rachel had already moved in all her stuff a couple of weeks ago. Her side of the closet took up more than half the with color coded outfits and the dresser drawers were filled with nearly folded blouses and pants and sweaters.

Rachel looked appalled for a minute. \"They wouldn\'t!\"

\"Then whose suit case is that?\"

Rachel\'s face relaxed when she caught sight of the Samsonite. \"Oh, that\'s mine. It was in storage while I was in quarantine.\"

\"Rabies is a bitch, isn\'t it.\"

\"You really are certifiable,\" Rachel said.

\"Why do you think you\'re here? Virgin birth?\"

Rachel started to put away the contents of the suit case and Old Girl decided she\'d do some spring cleaning of her own. Who cared if it was January and already dark as night at 4 pm. Presumably it was spring somewhere far from Idaho.

She went through her side of the closet and started liberating hangers and handing them to Rachel. \"Don\'t say I never did anything for you.\"

\"I wouldn\'t.\" Rachel looked at her funny. \"We have to live together. What\'s wrong with being friends?\"

The F-word made Old Girl recoil. Friends. That was the last fucking thing she needed right now.

\"What are doing with all that?\" Rachel nodded at the pile of shifts and skirts that Peggy had made Old Girl pack and that she\'d never worn. She was busy making a heap with all the throw-aways in front of the closet.

\"This is cute.\" Rachel reached into the pile and pulled out a new wrap-around dress that Peggy had bought for her the day before they drove her to Idaho from Portland. Peggy had said brightly, when she put it in Old Girl\'s suitcase, \"In case you get invited to any dances.\"

\"Take it,\" Old Girl said. \"I\'ve never worn it.\" The dances Peggy seemed to think that were part of Old Girl\'s future at Inner Horizons never materialized. If Old Girl wasn\'t bundled up to her eyeballs in wool or down, she was wearing the same pair of black sweats she\'d worn every day since the accident.

Rachel held the dress up in front of her body. She was trying to get a look at herself in the wavery lamp lit reflection the windows bounced back in the room from the darkness. God forbid they give anybody a real mirror that wasn\'t that non-reflective steel they put in highway rest-stops.

\"Have at,\" Old Girl said. No dances where she was going. And she was damn sure going to get rid of it before Peggy got the bright idea to bury her in it. Nuh-uhh.

\"But that\'s not fair,\" Rachel said. \"We should trade.\" She was busy rooting through the cloethes hung in the closet. She started pulled outfits out like a sales person and extolling their virtues. \"This is really cute on.\" She held up a pale pink tunic with lace on the collar and cuffs. Then she grabbed a pair of pink slacks neatly clothes-pinned by the hem with three or four other pairs of pants. \"This would look wonderful with your coloring.\" She dragged the pants up to her eggplant colored face and said, \"This color makes me look like I\'m going to puke.\"

\"I mostly wear black,\" Old Girl mutted. She was thinking that running away from her new room mate right that minute was starting to trump running away after midnight. Trading clothes! She\'d jumped that rite of passage the day the Sheriff showed up at the door at their house in Naperville and said, \"Oh, baby girl, this is going to hurt.\"

\"How about these? They\'re super cute.\" Rachel was holding up a green leather pair of pants that were so amazing, her heart nearly stopped in her chest.

\"Seriously, I don\'t need anything!\"

\"I\'ve got plenty,\" the new girl said. \"Way more than I will ever wear.\" The drawers of her packed dresser were starting to resist closing. She kept shoving clothes to the left so she didn\'t intrude on Old Girl\'s half but the clothes were pushing back and intruding in the space anyway.

\"What the hell is that?\" Despite Old Girl\'s desire to nip this friendship thing in the bud, she couldn\'t help but reach out to touch a long frilly hem of something white and spangled in her space. She pulled on a white over-skirt of something that was shining with sequins. It was bouffant and airfilled, sort of like a white formal \-- was that what it was? A prom dress? A cocktail dress? A get-up for a recital? It was concocted of white tulle and lacy white net and white lace in a meringue-like cloud of spaghetti straps and frothy underskirts. It spangled and sparkled under the dome light of the closet from multicolored sequins that were stitched all over fabric so that it reflected like a disco ball.

Rachel was doubled over next to the wall, laughing her ass off. \"You should see your face. \"you look like a bass yourself!\"

\"Where on earth do you expect to wear this thing?\" Old Girl danced around the room with the tulle floating around her like a giant meringue. \"To your wedding?\"

By the time Rachel got control of herself, tears were rolling down her cheeks and she was wiping her eyes furiously, because to Old Girl\'s horrow, it looked like she really was crying. A record at Inner Horizon. Laughter to tears in 10 seconds! Even in the mean halls of a psychiatric treatment center, it was a record for emotional break down.

Rachel finally gaspect out, almost unintelliglby, \"It\'s my fucking mother! She\'s out of her ever loving mind!\"

\"This was your mom\'s idea? To pack a\--.\" Old Girl stopped. \"What the hell is this puff ball? A first communion dress? Your Snow Fairy Winter Ice Festival costume?\"

\"Almost,\" Rachel said. \"It\'s my coming out dress. From my debutante ball.\"

\"No computer.\"

\"You know. Coming out. I\'m a debutante. I\'m from Atlanta.\"

Now it was Old Girl\'s time to laugh out loud. \"Who\'d you come out to? Why\'d you have to wear a dress? Most people just sit Mom and Dad down and say, \"I\'m gay. What are you going to do about it.\"

This set Rachel off into another paroxysm of screaming laughter. By the end of the fit, she was doubled over and beating at the quilt on her bed with her fist. Finally, she slid down to the floor on her butt and held one fist to her side saying, \"Oh, that hurts. My side hurts! You have to quit.\"

To entertain herself, Old Girl had draped the white spaghetti straps over her sweat-shirted shoulders and waltzed around the dorm room with the dress floating and whirling with her body, singing, \"Mom I\'m gay, Dad I\'m gay, Grandma, Grandpa, I\'m gay and looney and coming out to you in a dress the size of a rain cloud.\"

Both girls were both laughing, then, and making animal squawks and snorting noses. It wasn\'t really funny to Old Girl but even she could\'t stop the chortles and snorts for a long while.

\"Seriously,\" she finally said, \"Did you Mom read an Inner Horizons brochure that promises a Nut Job Ball? That is the only sane reason I can imagine you packing that to come to Idaho. Try walking down Main Street in Coeur D\'Alene and you\'ll see what I mean!\"

\"I swear. She made me bring it! She said I\'d never know if there was an occasion to wear it and it would be better to be safe than sorry.\"

\"Better to be quietly nuts than certifiable, I say. Maybe you\'re not the one who needs their head examined.\"

\"It looks like you\'re settling in for the duration,\" Old Girl said when the suit case was nearly empty. \"How long are you planning to be here.\"

\"Mom said I can\'t come home until I\'m better,\" Rachel said. \"\"How long is that? Maybe never.\" Rachel\'s voice wasn\'t laughing now. Her tone lowered and she wouldn\'t raise her eyes to Old Girl\'s.

\"Definitely never.\" Old Girl said. \"Not if you expect these people to cure you.\"

\"You really are funny,\" Rachel said.

\"Me?\"

\"No, the other person in the room who just cracked me up more in the last half hour than I have laughed in the last year.\"

\"You should watch more Trevor Noah. You\'d never say that about me if you\'d seen him.\"

\"How come you do that?\"

\"What?\"

\"Deflect. Every time I try to give you something, you turn it aside.\"

\"I don\'t.\"

\"See? I just gave you a compliment about being funny and you won\'t accept it. I tried to give you a pair of paints that make me look like a fat ass and you won\'t take those either.\"

\"Fine. Give me the fat ass pants and I\'ll think of you everytime I wear them in my new life.\"

Rachel\'s eyebrows knit over sharp, hazel green eyes. \"What new life?\"

Old Girl blithely waved her hand, dismissing her own comment while inside she was thinking. \"Christ. Loose fucking lips and sinks ships and all that bull shit. Zippity. Zip Zip! She ran her index finger across her lips, remember how her mother used to warn her about bringing up bathroom sounds or farting in company. \"Nothing. I was just making another lame joke. See, I\'m not that funny.\"

Rachel wadded up the lace and tulle skirt and shoved all the froth ruthlessly into the black of the closet where it was out of sight and held back by the weight of all her other clothes. \"To me you are, \" she said mulishly.

\"But you\'re in a psychiatric institution, nut job. Your opion doesn\'t count.\"

Old Girl had the last word because then Med Check was called and then she walked Rachel to the Supply Closet they called the Nurse\'s Office.

Funny, she thought, while they waited in the line for their med which were being handed out by Gloria, the Nurse, and Margaret. I\'m not funny. I\'m just off my rocker.

Funny, she thought. I\'m not funny. Just a garden variety nut case trying to break out of the institution before anybody gets wise.

Funny, she thought. I\'m not funny. I\'m just a garden variety nut case trying to make a run for it before anybody gets wise.

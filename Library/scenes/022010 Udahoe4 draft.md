022010 4th draft

**Process Group**

Nothing worth processing ever happened in Process Group. Not in Godforsaken Idaho, not in the middle of January, not during a snowstorm that had started in early fall and was apparently going to drag on until spring. Twelve of Inner Horizon\'s Young Adults (18-24) were arguing in Healing House's living room about whose turn it was to go first. Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up in Coeur d' Alene, Idaho, everybody in the program called the place Udahoe. Get it? U- Da- Hoe, for doing whatever stupid fucked up shit that landed you in a residential psychiatric program with people even more fucked up than you.

Old Girl -- she refused to answer to any other name -- had landed at Inner Horizons almost three years ago for trying to off herself. She had three official tries on her record, but she\'d actually been trying since she was twelve. It just wasn't that easy to kill yourself when you only had the life experiences of a preteen. She had the will early on, after her parents and baby brother were killed in a car crash with a senile senior citizen; she just didn't have the smarts. Peggy and David (her adoptive parents) had a well stocked medicine cabinet but it took a lot of trial and error to figure out what was lethal. How was a pre-teen supposed to know that taking a super size bottle of laxatives would only make her pray to die, instead of killing her outright? Peggy and David had used the insurance money to ship her off to Inner Horizon's adolescent program at sixteen. Now, at 18, she had graduated from Adolescents to Young Adults, where she couldn't see any difference in the level of maturity, unless she counted the improvement in psychobabble. Any moron could spout on about accountability and self-actualization and dialectical behavior modification after three hours of individual therapy every week and once-every-other--day peer groups, like the one underway.

Darlene, the therapist on duty, introduced the new girl like a cheer leader -- "Rachel Interlachen! Yay!" while Old Girl watched an icicle spear stuck to the eaves of Healing House get longer. The Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. Last night, newbie-Rachel had, like Old Girl in her ancient past, been frog-marched into Healing House by two Christ-spouting "escorts" in matching ski jackets which meant that Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to avoid a plane ride with their flipped-out, drug-addled, possibly violent and definitely sobbing girl in order to get her out of their hair. She sported a short sleeved tee shirt so everyone could see the fresh cut marks on her arms. Horizontal marks, not vertical. Garden variety self-injurer, Old Girl surmised, like the vast majority of the girls sprawled on the irregular semi-circle of couches and chairs. *Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a fat cook who ought to be executed with it for hate crimes against food.*

It was obvious the new girl was still in the honey moon phase of imagining Idaho: the advertising lie of lakes as blue as Steller's jays and endless diamond-sparkled peaks. The endless part was right. Wait till she was trapped by freezing temperatures and four walls and emotional dramas fifty times a day. Old Girl sometimes had to cover her head with a pillow by 8 p.m., she was so exhausted by the anxieties pulsating around 20 fuck-ups. An escape to anywhere, even the grave, seemed like nirvana to Old Girl. All her failures had inured her to the sense of suicides' permanence; she had tried to kill herself so often, she was convinced she was doomed to always come back for more suffering. She didn't know crap about Buddhism, but what she knew told her that life was a shell, a carapace, and she was stuck in the dung beetle phase of life. Ground Hog Day, a movie she watched lying on the couch napping and waking with the flu was the way she thought of life and death. You tried to kill yourself in ever inventive ways and you always woke up to make another attempt. If at first you don't succeed. Try, try again.

"Let's welcome Rachel to her new family!" chirped Darlene who was so cheerful everyone wanted to strangle her. Family was dead on. Everybody sitting in the circle of couches and chairs in the oversized living room was just as fucked up and dysfunctional as a real family, except none of the participants would have forked out \$12, 000 a month for the pleasure of living together. Darlene's voice, to Old Girl's practiced ears, took her back to an ancient memory of nap time, when Mom would give her a graham cracker and let her lie on her bedspread while she read her stories with happy endings. Here, there were no graham crackers -- at Inner Horizons, you snacked on carrot sticks and celery between meals because of the overload of anorexics and bulimics in the program -- and no stories that Old Girl knew of with happy endings. There was James Olson, the loser of the argument about who had to go first in 'taking ownership of his behaviors': Inner Horizon speak for telling the new girl what fuck-ups stuck him here.

James looked younger than 19, a surfer-blond, not yet used to his height (he was famous for tripping over his own feet). He ticked off his behaviors in a bored voice. "Substance abuse, alcoholic, DUI, school suspension and...." James pinched the area between his eyebrows, like he had a headache. "Littering."

Yuk. Yuk. Old Girl had heard the joke before. A few of the people here less than a couple months cracked smiles.

Danny, a pale freckly red head with an infected nose ring, went next: "An-or-EX-i-A, Bu-LIM-i-a, self-in-JURE --y\..."

Newbie Rachel cast her eyes up to the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. Old Girl felt for her. She wondered if all her suicide tries had aged her. She didn't insist on people calling her Old Girl because she was the longest tenured resident of Inner Horizons. Old Girl was how she felt: ancient and achy in her bones and tired of existence, like somebody who lived on and on into the hundreds and longed for death as the best option available.

Next up: Old Girl's nemesis, Princess Leia, J.A.P. royalty from Westchester, New York, and the most annoying shit on the planet. "Sex addiction, inappropriate touching with a minor, prostitution, sexual harassment of a teacher, lewd conduct..." Here, Leia took out her gum and inspected it, before putting it back in her mouth and licking her fingers, while looking at James.

"Come on, Leia, we don't have all day," said Darlene.

"And shooting the moon at a police officer." Old Girl noted that Leia had left out all the shit she'd gotten in trouble for here.

So it went around the chairs, across the couch. Cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex, shoplifting, peer violence, theft, assault and battery, sibling abuse, incest, road rage, gambling addiction, exposure, fire starting, property destruction: you named it, the Inner Horizons family had taken a crash course in life wreckage and gotten all As.

Rachel hunched over, shoulders drawn in as if to protect her heart. Her face was a rigid mask of Klonapin-affect, newly prescribed.

"Tell us about you," Darlene urged when the circle finally came around to Rachel. "What behaviors do you need to own up to?"

Rachel opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up, and her blue china-doll eyes rolled back in her head and she pitched backwards, knees buckling over the coffee table, straight into James Olson's lap.

\* \* \*

James was late to Process Group because his therapist, Josh, was late for individual therapy so they went ten minutes over. It wasn't like missing out on Process was a big deal. Three times a week under the microscope of your peers would make any normal person postal.

Normal. That was a joke. James was surrounded by the lame and halt at Inner Horizons, all the abnormal with parents who could pay the freight just like James' parents had paid: Dad, CEO of a biotech company, and Dr. Mom, a clinical researcher, both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh had reminded him of today in his session. *When are you going to grow up?* Josh had asked. *You're the professional. You tell me.*

"What the shit?" he said to Ophelia, next to him on the couch, when the new girl stood up. James thought she was getting up to go to the can. Instead, her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. She went over like tree trunk pulled up by its roots, falling towards him, and when she landed in his lap, he had the unusual perspective of looking at her upside down face into the whites of her eyes. *Exorcist time*. Her pupils were completely rolled up in her head.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Somebody get Bruce." She yelled at Leia. "Call 9-1-1!"

By this time, the new girl was flopping like a carp on the carpet and everybody in Process was sitting forward on the edge of their seats like they were watching Chain Saw II at the multiplex. James was torn between being thankful to the new girl for providing something new to talk about and feeling appalled at the sight of Bruce, the day manager, kneeling on her elbows while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James and Reza were instructed to hold onto her legs and the instant James touched her, he felt something like a shock wave circling through her body, around and around is if he were holding onto a person being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, even though James was holding his leg down with his full strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying on of hands on a person seized by electricity, as if a bolt of lighting struck her out of the ether-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. After what seemed like an eternity of convulsions, the blond girl's eyes --light blue, almost opalescent-- popped open. James had the impression the new girl was looking up at the faces clustered above her and wondering whether she'd died and gone to hell. Consciousness -- of what she'd done, not necessarily who they were -- spread over her face in a slow motion wave of horror. *The monster is out of the closet---and it is me*, James read.

"Are you feeling better?" Darlene was asking her. James saw shame pouring out of her pores while she pretended to memorize the carpet pattern. When she struggled to a sitting position, James helped pulled her up and surprised himself by squeezing her hand. The fingers were long and thin, fragile as bird bones. She squeezed automatically back, then catching his eye, dropped James' hand as if she'd been burned.

Because Healing House was ten miles outside of town, Darlene and Bruce decided to load the new girl into the Suburban and take her to the hospital; it was faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Micah, one of the Junior Counselors, in charge.

After that, Process Group was officially toast. Everybody basically sat around and replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Maxi Eaton, the anorexic-bulimic who never thought of anything but food, said, "I thought she was going to barf up breakfast." Reza, the Iron Maiden fanatic from New Jersey, said, "I thought she had to go to the can."

"Didn't they know she was epileptic?" Angela, the mean girl who'd been at the program the longest of any of them, was outraged. "What the fuck's wrong with them? They should know stuff like that."

Angela wouldn't deign to speak to James, a short timer of only six weeks (an eternity, in his mind). How was he supposed to know she called herself Old Girl when he mistakenly called her Angela? *Excuuuuuse me*. "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you can plan for," James said. Another surprise. Usually he avoided Old Girl rather than give her the chance to rip him apart with her razor tongue. She was pretty scary with that head full of long, cinnamon colored dreads and an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he was most familiar with at the bottom of a bottle of tequila.

A mammoth kid named Paul who never *ever* said anything, spoke up. "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to tell him. Everybody stared at Paul like they'd heard a ghost.

"What the fuck are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her *skull!"*

They all laughed then and Paul went back to humming his tuneless song. James wasn't sure but he suspected Paul was autistic. He\'d been too busy with his own shit to find out. He felt Leia bump him from behind, the sign she wanted sex. As usual, her timing was impeccable.

**Peer Interaction**

Leia had an itch the size of Godzilla. Leia had been hoping the newbie would be a boy --a hella-boy with a hella-itch itch to match. She had been seriously bummed when the long haired blond girl stumbled into breakfast that morning asking for coffee. The expression on her face when they said she could have herbal tea!

She put James under the microscope while he stuttered through his list of behaviors in Process Group: Darlene's dopy idea of a welcome ritual for the new girl. James seemed to be confessing his sins to the popcorn-coated ceiling. A flush crept out of his shirt collar and began climbing his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school? James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Leia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Leia's experience, which was pretty wide, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, its implacability (a word on her G.E. D. vocabulary list) they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

At the new girl's turn to show her underwear, she stood up like a dumb ass. You could have knocked Leia down when the new girl fell like a pile driver into James's lap. Why James? She started jerking like a girl strung out on Angel Dust that Leia had seen near Times Square. *They should have given her the coffee,* flashed through Leia's mind.

Leia ran for the wooden spoon that Darlene screamed at her to get -- *what, are they going to beat her with it?* -and then, because she didn't know what else to do, sat down in Darlene's chair while the seizure went on and on. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary Leia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's bag crammed into the chair seat with her. The wallet was clearly visible at the top. Everybody else was tuned into the horror show so she picked out a twenty dollar bill in one smooth motion and had it safe in her pocket before the twitching stopped.

Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling the blond up to go to the hospital. The coast was clear. Leia nudged James from behind, then slipped into the bathroom first.

She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the tub without any pants. Some brainiac had installed the old porcelain claw-foot tub on an exterior wall of Healing House. Maybe it was okay in summer but in the middle of January, you half-expected ice cubes to spill from the tap. Nobody in their right mind ever took a bath in here; Healing House didn't have enough hot water for twelve people, much less enough to heat up a tub the size of an iceberg. Leia could hear her nutcase aunt back in her old house in Montreal telling her "get in and get out!" when she wanted Leia to take a bath in the winter. Maybe that was why David, her cousin who was three years older, started crawling into her bed when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. The thought was perhaps the only kind one she'd ever had about kitten-killer David. Was this Inner Horizon shit finally working? She dismissed the idea like a bad smell in the room.

What in hell was taking James so long? She had heard the Suburban rumble past the window on the way to the hospital, she thought.

Then the shower rings jingled and Pavlov's dog couldn't have climbed up James' lanky body and thrown its legs around his waist any faster. James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He had just started to kiss her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes locked on Leia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lip to keep from hooting aloud.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard-- that, and the fact that the Pee Clogger didn't bother to wash at the sink.

The door banged and the snort flew out of Leia like a caged bird. "Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close." "Not as close as this, big boy." Leia grappled at his belt buckle but James held her hands away from his body. '"Don't," he said. "There's no way I can concentrate. Not after all the shit that's gone down today. "

By then, the itch was like jungle drums. "Concentrate? Just don't think!" Leia had a momentary flash of empathy with the crazy girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Leia was having inside without any flopping or jerking. \"Pleeeeeease!" The word came out like a whine, but she couldn't help it. If James didn't help her get off, she was going to fly into a million jagged pieces.

The curtain rings were already jingling behind him. Pavlov's dog has an empty bowl. "Just chill," James said on his way out. The temperature in the tub dropped another twenty degrees.

**Outdoor Activity**

Saturday. Outdoor Activity day. Everybody was running around trying to find their expedition wear. Old Girl, ski-hatted, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy down at the front door, feIt like a pre-schooler. Where's the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and over her neck?

It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door for Mom to wrestle Gabe into his snowsuit. Because she was three years older, she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding the baby between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down so she can get his square little foot corked in the boot. At Old Girl's far removal, she half-imagined hearing a pop when the foot finally slipped in. A *bloop* instead of a *thwock*? The reverse of a champagne cork's pop. What was Gabe doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the happy, sun-dappled Before of her life, and came up blank. Gabe was a smiter-- not like her, a colicky screamer according to Peggy, her mother's sister, and now her Guardian with her husband, David, in the perpetual After. Her mind went as empty as an ice-covered lake. Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. She used to be able to call up Dad, a builder, by smelling fresh-cut wood. Now when she carried kindling and split logs for Healing House's woodstove, all she smelled was pine or pitch. Dad was gone, carried up the chimney and released into the frigid air -- even further gone than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a half-blind senior citizen had crashed into all three of them.

The sky was its usual color of cement. The Suburban hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how Josh told them to say it). A French name from some ancient trapper who was looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just a pack of kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the relentless storms. People were singing into fists held like fake microphones to the radio. Some country western sob song, *Prayin' for daylight*,*waitin' for that morning sun* they all screamed. Old Girl had never gotten used to the noise. When Peggy shipped her out to Idaho after eating all her Valium, the first thing she understood had been taken away from her was a quiet place to hear herself think.

James and Leia already had a black mark (a rating of one) plus a warning for inappropriate touching barely five miles away from the house. Now James sat next to Josh in the front seat, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Leia's crotch. Rachel, the new girl, who was now slumped against the window next to James. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but she'd checked out okay at the hospital. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Leia in the far back. Barfland was glacial. Yesterday, Leia forgot to mention nymphomania in her behavioral introduction to Being a nympho was the first thing Leia usually hit you with. Anorexia and bulimia and cutting were too outcognito to brag about. Luckily, Leia had borrowed somebody's IPod and emitted tinny hip-hop rhythms from her ear buds so Old Girl didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Leia has traded oral sex for candy in the past week.

Instead, Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House, with endless blue-tinged trees and a frozen landscape in which nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About a mile was Old Girl's calculation. Less if it was snowing.

Josh planned to make them snowshoe up to a mountain lake that fed into the main lake. It was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head for the van. The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt like she was always being assaulted. You live with eighteen troubled adolescents and the first thing you realize they confiscated from you was quiet. Old Girl was used to wearing her IPod but it had seen stolen by some asshole two weeks ago. Another IPod was stolen this week. You didn't catch old Girl whining about it, like Leia, next to her, jerking her head to the beat. Old Girl had darker plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

\* \* \* \*

The trail climbed gently for a mile, then got steeper in a hurry. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of Intensive to Transition, he could play basketball again and he wanted to be in shape. Would the move to Transition be like moving from one circle of hell to the next? At night, he'd been working his way through Healing House's rag-tag library to combat the mind-numbing boredom. He was in the middle of *The Inferno*, not that he'd ever let on to his parents who had eons ago given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but X --Box.

It quieted down in a hurry once the going got harder. Leia lagged several people behind him in a snit. She was mad about getting a warning in the car, even madder at James because he'd been wrestling her hand away from his crotch, which was how they got caught. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight was idiotic. Demeaning, like he was a piece of meat. He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary. The incident in the bathtub, when Darlene rushed in to pee (he caught a glimpse of her neon orange ski jacket), would have gotten both of them sent to Stabilization, a medicated gulag somewhere even deeper in the hinterlands of Idaho than Healing House. James wasn't interested in moving lower on Inner Horizon's circles of hell. Intensive already ranked right up there with Paolo and Francesca's hellish windstorm.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Leia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the men's bathroom on the lame community school campus where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (*Progress!* His mother enthused on the phone.) He wondered if there was an Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Leia's motivations had more to do with risk than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for eternal love, he told himself. It would be nice to just be liked.

The new girl, Rachel, tramped steadily behind him. She was a dancer so she must be in pretty good shape. She was keeping up with him and they were way up ahead of the pack. Angela --Old Girl was a few steps behind them, but she didn't count because Angela spent hours on the treadmill every day and James was always having to trade her his allowance money so she'd let him have his forty-five minutes of pain. Five dollars! What trouble can you get in with five bucks? Sam, his dealer, told him one time about nickel bags, but to James, that was as far distant as the days of the dinosaurs.

The only sound: the schuss-swish of the snowshoes. Giant snow-shrouded pines pinched off the dim sun. It wasn't that cold \-- not for Idaho --maybe twenty-five degrees? Rachel stepped on the back of his snowshoe and he almost fell. "Sorry!" she said. James kneeled to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the strap. "It's okay, I was lagging."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she didn't have the right to make a suggestion. She was still in the honeymoon phase with Inner Horizon's rules, worrying about the stay-together lecture they got from Josh at the trailhead. Angela passed them, stepping out of the trail and skirting them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "It's okay. As long as the three of us hang together."

He fell in behind Angela. The stillness of the wilderness made him feel miniscule. No foot tracks---just the soft skitter pads of some four footed creature. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone, their next-door neighbor. What he'd really like to see is a wolf. He'd settle for a moose. Something majestic. If he saw a moose, he'd have something safe to talk about with Dad and Dr. Mom on the weekly family therapy call. Family torture call, everybody called it. Why didn't his parents just give it up and accept that he was a loser? Not everybody could be like Susan, his sister, with A's on every report card, President of the Student Body, accepted by Yale *and* Princeton which took a month of agonizing dinner time debate while James sat at the dining room table hoping his report card hadn't arrived. He checked the mail faithfully the minute he got home but once he started coming home drunk or stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks? A shit load, apparently.

> **\* \* \* \***

Rachel heard it before she saw it. A sound like distant breaking glass. Then thrashing and gnashing accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Angela raced ahead up the blue- shadowed trail, followed by James who was fleet as a deer. A thunderous crack. An odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Rachel had ever heard in her junior riding days, got louder, more hysterical, as they ran.

By the time they reached the lake, the elk was already tiring. Rachel could see the cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged pool a hundred yards from shore. An elk floundered there, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. She would lunge part way up, heaving her massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break with her weight. Every time the elk seemed to get up on the edge, another cliff of snow-covered ice would crack off like a whip. The black water was dotted with snow clumps and floating ice that shuddered and bobbed while the creature swam in circles.

"Holy shit," James' voice was awestruck.

"How can we help?" Angela's voice broke like an over-tuned harp string. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight of the drowning creature, she registered the fracture of Angela's careful cooler-than-thou facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind while the elk made another lunge. It had huge antlers and starting eyes that rolled in terror as it swam.

"Don't go out there. You'll fall in." James sounded as if he'd already accepted the inevitable.

Angela wasn't having any of that crap. "We need a stick!" She started yanking at a clump of downed logs partially submerged at the lake's edge. She got her hands on a stout branch and was using her body weight, trying to break it off at the trunk.

"What's it going to hold on with?" James eyed Angela as if she were nuts. "Don't even think about going out there!"

"Maybe we can lever its body up. Just enough to help it onto the thicker ice. " Angela was talking to Rachel and with both girls jumping on the branch, it finally began to splinter.

Rachel had the ice-laden branch in her bare hands when the elk made its final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back, and then, as they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its head and body sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of the antlers lit by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above the black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly under, the only sign that the elk had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-blotted hole.

Josh and the rest of the group broke onto the lakeshore and Josh started barking at them in a passed off voice. "What the hell were you thinking?\" You're supposed to stay with the group!" He issued a second warning to James, and Angela and Rachel both got ones for poor peer interactions and ignoring the rules. Rachel was still fuzzy about Inner Horizons' arcane system of "consequences," which involved numbers from one to three for everything from household chores to therapeutic progress, whatever that meant.

Rachel opened her mouth to tell the group about the drowning elk when Angela slipped sideways, nearly knocking her to the ground. *What the\--?* James had turned away from the group, and was acting like he was busy inspecting a clump of sad aspen saplings with some kind of blight. Rachel took Angela's glower as a hint. She shut her mouth. "Jesus, watch where you're going," Rachel said to Angela, yanking her snowshoe away.

Josh was the one who pointed out the jagged hole in the ice. Mr. Wilderness in a flannel cap and wool Army-Navy pants. "Looks like something fell through. Anybody guess what?"

Everybody, except Rachel, Angela and James, hazarded an idea. Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big the hole is. You can see its claw marks."

An acne-inflicted boy Rachel hadn't met rolled his eyes in disgust. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else noticed the tracks and thought maybe a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, and zebras, along with Godzilla and Dr. Buchanan, the head of the program.

A few light snowflakes drifted in sideways. That ended the nature lesson. Josh called for an about-face before the snow got serious and told them to hightail it back to the Suburban. Josh, a native Idahoan, had some weird localisms. On the car ride up to the trailhead, he'd yelled back at one of the kids *Shut your pie hole*. Not a phrase Rachel had heard in the Chicago bedroom community of Naperville where she'd grown up until the year her mom was killed in a house fire.

The fire was the demarcation line in Rachel's maturity. Afterwards, she couldn't decide if she was hopelessly older or hopelessly younger than her peers. Epilepsy was just the icing on her Mom-less cake. Hardly worth mentioning, except for the embarrassment of yesterday's performance. She was still touched that James had tried to squeeze her hand. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Had the black pants she wore like a uniform protected her like she hoped? She couldn't see how. So when he gave her a lopsided little grin, and took up a position right behind her on the trail, as if he wanted to watch over her, her heart gave a tiny lurch.

**Med Check**

Rachel and Old Girl were early for Med Check. The nurse, Gloria, was still counting out pills into a row of plastic cups. Margaret, the Day supervisor, was reading a chart for a girl named Angela, double checking the little cups of colorful brain candy against her clipboard. Rachel had gotten good at reading upside down in the early days of her epileptic seizures. Since her head was continually stuffed with cotton-batting, it was the only way she could track what they were giving her. *Angela's cup overfloweth*, she thought, reading the long list of meds on the nurse's chart. Almost as many as Rachel's own list which had all her epilepsy drugs plus anti-anxiety this, anti depressant-that, and whatever else her therapist felt compelled to try in the continual quest to make life worth living.

"Who's Angela Livengood?" she said to Old Girl. "I haven't met her yet."

Old Girl arched an eyebrow. "You don't want to. She's a bitch."

Inner Horizons seemed to have a lot of bitches, Rachel thought. Like the one who had rifled her suitcase and stolen her new, never-worn Lulu Lemon pants before she even had a chance to unpack. "How so?"

Angela held up one dreads by the end in front of her eyes, making her look cross-eyed and crazy. "For one thing, she'll rip your ears off if you call her Angela."

"Really?"

"It pisses her off. It's a stupid name."

"Angela means angel."

"Angel of Death to her."

A grim way self image. "What does she look like?"

"Like me."

Rachel reflected on Old Girl's waist-length dreads, now collected in a fountain spray of ginger stalks, like a clump of cattails waving on the top of her head.

"I haven't seen anybody else with dreads here. Who's she rooming with?"

Old Girl yawned as if bored with the conversation. "You."

Margaret, finished with her check and recheck routine, called out, "You're up, Oldster," and 0ld Girl obediently threw back all dozen or so pills in two swallows, refusing the little glass of water held out to her. Then, like a chick waiting to be fed by the Mama Bird, Old Girl opened her mouth and let Margaret swab under her tongue, between cheek and gums, and she leaned back slightly to let Margaret peer, like a spelunker, into the cave of her mouth.

How's it going on with Abilify? Margaret wanted to know. "It's week three."

Old Girl raised up a shoulder to her ear, like a hunchback, and dragged her leg in halting steps toward the door. "Fabbo! Can't you tell?"

Rachel was taking Abilify too and she wanted to say *Give it time* --she remembered how jangly and suicidal she felt the first six weeks until she got used to it. But Old Girl was already waggling her fingers good-bye, Tweety-Bird style.

Rachel called after her, "That Angela girl could be wrong. It could mean Avenging Angel."

"As long as it's not Angela," Old Girl said, "her ears are safe."

**Lights Out**

Old Girl wanted a razor in the worst way. If she had a razor, it would only take a second to get it done and then it wouldn't bag her anymore.

Rachel was sitting on the end of her bed across from old Girl, shuffling through her make-up bag. There was always a big pileup in the bath room before lights out, so they were waiting their turn. "Damn. I forgot to bring my toe nail clippers. Can I borrow yours?"

Old Girl snorted. "They took those away from me the minute I got here."

"Well how do you clip your nails?"

"I don't. I just let them grow under my feet. Now they're so long, I don't need shoes."

Rachel looked at her --then laughed. "If I'd known they'd make me room with a comedian, I wouldn't have made such a stink about coming here."

It was old Girl's turn to laugh. Too bad she wasn't going to be around for the new girl to get to know her. She had a million jokes about suicide, but not that many people appreciated them.

"Yippee! I didn't forget!" Rachel held up a small pair of nail clippers.

Old Girl was amazed. "Didn't they go through your stuff when you got here? That's contraband."

"What's wrong with having toe nail clippers?"

"You don't cut your nails down into the quick? Like every other girl here?"

"I guess I'm a cutter, not a clipper. The idea never crossed my mind." Rachel looked like she was turning over the idea of clipping her toe nails for the pain value in her mind. "I guess I'm just not creative. Not like you."

"Me? Creative?"

"You're always saying something funny. What else would you call it?"

Mordant was the word that flashed through Old Girl's brain. True, but not funny. "You must have pretty low standards."

From Rachel's wince, Old Girl saw she'd hit a soft spot and felt sorry, for about the millionth time, her radar affinity for an open wound.

Leia passed by their room with a shit eating grin. She'd been hogging the bathroom, as usual. "Lights out in three minutes," she said sweetly, grinning like the cat that ate the canary and the chocolates too.

"Bitch" Both girls spoke in unison. Then laughed at the moment of communion.

Rachel led the way down the hall to the bathroom and that's when Old Girl had a flash of inspiration. Cutting nails wasn't the only thing clippers were good for.

"Mind if I borrow those clippers?"

Rachel hesitated.

"I don't have HIV."

"It's not that. It's just..." She leaned against the sink, spreading her fingers and clenching them like she was trying to grasp something elusive. "I don't want you to hurt yourself with them."

"You'll be right here. I don't know you well enough to off myself in front of you."

Rachel handed over the clippers and went about her face washing ritual -- it looked like it required a masters to get through all the steps \-- and Old Girl went over to the little baby changing station that hung on the back wall. She'd been thinking of doing this forever but she'd been stymied by the prohibition on razors when you lived in Cutter D'Alene, Idaho.

After Rachel's final rinse, Old Girl made a show of holding the clippers up in the mirror so she could see her drop them back in her make-up bag. "See. No harm done."

It wasn't until a few days later that Rachel finally noticed Old Girl's handiwork. Old Girl had scraped the "c" off the baby changing station and now the type read, "Baby Hanging Station."

Rachel's laugh caught her unexpectedly like a little poke in the chest. Thank God I got a roommate with a sense of humor, Rachel thought. This place would be hell with somebody who was really depressed.

Failure to thrive. In Intro to Psych, she had been reading about various afflictions in babies and toddlers. The one that spoke to her -- actually gave her goose bumps -- was failure to thrive syndrome. A baby fed and diapered and clothed but with no interaction, no closeness to other human beings, basically shriveled in its crib. Was she becoming a bag of bones? You end up as a bag of bones and you start out as a bag of bones. OG was waiting for the plump, roly-poly happy stage of her childhood to come back but it never did.

121918 Twain ending and what OG learns about death

She'd learned something from this experience. All her fantasies about dying swanlike, palely beautiful, were a pallid shadow of the actual thing. She felt a spur of adrenalin, a sudden need to move, as if her own body was saying, get moving.

She wasn't afraid of the dead man. Nor afraid of dying, for that matter. The feeling was more profound than that. She felt as if she'd been privileged to witness something as extraordinary as birth; something that wouldn't adrenalize her in the same way until fifteen years in the future when she had her own child.

It would be more than fifteen years later when she had her own child when she experienced a blast of adrenalin as powerful as the one that powered her out of the truck and made her drop precariously from the cab which was leaned at a vertiginous angle up against the Ponderosa.

She'd only walked about a mile when a friendly milkman -- milk lady, as it turned out---picked her up.

The vivid pink sky behind her changed in an instant: It was in the past, and OG, now Vivian Gorming, to the truck driver and to anyone else she would meet, looked in the rear view mirror and saw that its glory was gone. It would be back tomorrow, never in this precise pink and fuschia way, never in today's glorious new dawn colors, but in some other extraordinary or boring or even gray and misty way. A vision of neon raccoons that exploded the night sky over Healing House on the night of the fire came to her. That time was gone. It was back in another life. She was on to a new one, no longer OG, the name she christened herself with, but now Vivian, her mother's name for her, as she'd introduced herself in a mature and adult way to the semi-truck driver named Don.

Dawn of a new day, Vivian mused.

She took out James's copy of Huckleberry Finn to read on the trip to Seattle. Sorry James. She had needed something to read, seen his backpack in the front hall and exchanged Huck for her dog-eared copy of Lord of the Flies.

She flipped to the back page, as was her custom. She wanted to read how a book ended before she started it, in case it was too close to real life.

She read, "Tom's most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watch guard for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to write a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a going to no more."

When she read the next sentence, she thought OK, this is good. Everything ends up alright. She settled in for the long ride to Seattle with an open book on her lap with \_\_\_\_\_\_ singing on \_\_\_\_\_\_ radio.

"But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me; and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before."

Good, she thought. This'll be OK. Mark Twain is funny. He's not talking about real life. Perfect for a girl lighting out for myself. Go west young woman, go west. And just for good measure, she added the Vulcan wish: Live long and prosper, Dr. Hazey.

Something about the man's passing electrifies her. He's gone. Still there in the garbage smelling husk but no longer bright eyed and restless and clinging. She has to move: her feet are numb and clumsy when she makes the three-feet drop from the precariously perched cab to the snow below. She falls through the crust up to her hips and has to wriggle and wade and stagger her way to the berm and then slide down to the slippery road. She can see where the truck's tires have skated off the packed and glistening ice. The truck drove partially up the Ponderosa tree and now the giant tree is leaning back at an angle from its weight.

It occurs to her that perhaps it wasn't that smart to climb into the cab. What if the balance of truck to tree had shifted from her additional weight. As if in answer to the thought, the truck slowly and seemingly against gravity turns and walks its weight around the bole of the tree in one heart-stopping second. It crashes to its side. The man's who's silhouette was profiled in the cab, is buried in a bright explosion of snow that bursts upward in a white, obliterating wind and cloud.

She walks down the road, inexplicably thinking about sex. It's not something that's been on her radar for a long time. It's like the Program or her mental state -- she isn't sure which one -- has put life on hold until that moment. Now that she's out and walking away from Inner Horizons, it becomes distant and blurred around the edges like a memory although she can still feel Rachel asleep in her bed across from the covered up pillow lump she's left that will fool no one.

Why the thought of Big Paul's hardon raises its spiky head is not clear to her. She's led an asexual, monastic life since she arrived at the Program at 16, broken-hearted, depressed beyond belief, looking for any way to put an end to the pain. The pain hadn't gotten better exactly -- it was still there -- it was just more tolerable. There was room around the edges of its dull ache for other thoughts to intrude. What would sex with Big Paul be like?

He was so quiet, he was mostly ignorable though he was large and muscular and darkly handsome. He looked Native American. Flat cheekbones. Hawk-ish, axe-blade nose. Not attractive in the skinny, affable way of blond and blue-eyed James. His was a darker beautiful of someone who didn't know they were good looking and would have been surprised if you said so.

Too late now, she thinks as she plods onward. He's back at Healing House, still asleep in the boy's wing, unaware of anything but his math and physics equations or whatever Asbergery boys on the spectrum dream about. Dr. Hazey has told her she needs to live a little. How had he put it in his quaint, out-of-touch way? Walk on the wild side? He said sex was an imperative to keep the species going. Physiologically, it felt good to spur people into self-gratification when its real purpose was the continuation of the human race. Very academic and slightly unhinged from reality Dr. Hazey. Big Paul must be in that big body somewhere.

OG had seen him get a hard-on in Process. She'd been sitting next to him. Lydia had been talking about how a blow job wasn't sex, it was power -- my power over you, she had said, looking right a James who blushed as red as a turkey buzzard. Apparently Big Paul wasn't immune to Lydia's charms, hence the tent in his pants which he hastily covered with a notebook when he noticed OG looking at his lap. He'd mouthed "sorry" and given a little roll of his dark eyes, like "what can you do?" OG hadn't thought about this glimpse into Big Paul's inner life in a year. What can you do, she was thinking, in the face of death? Have sex and enjoy it, was the answer that surprised her by its strength and vehemence. Was this the meaning -- the insistence---of what the boys talked about when they talked about getting a cockstand?

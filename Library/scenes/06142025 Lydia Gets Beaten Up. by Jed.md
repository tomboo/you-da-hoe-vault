JED TROLLED ALONG BEHIND LYDIA IN HIS TRICKED OUT TRUCK. She was on her way to the van pickup stop, early for once, and he caught up to her on Garden Street, pacing the truck speed to her steps. Through the open window, he called, "Hey, bitch, you owe me."

The van stop where Margaret usually showed up early, was half a block up ahead. No van in sight.

The only people in sight were a young couple who passed her on the street side, close to the invisible tether of Jed's truck. They were holding hands, engaged in conversation. The boy holding the girl's hand was all eyes at the red flames shooting out of the custom paint job. Should she turn around and run back toward him? Would the couple help her get away?

She sped up, though it didn't matter if she got to the bench any faster. No one else was there. No one was going to be there, because she was fifteen minutes early. So much for stupid New Year's resolutions.

"Get in," Jed said. "Time for pay back."

A movement from the back seat caught her eye. A thin man stepped out of the still-moving truck before Lydia realized Jed wasn't alone. He snaked behind her and Jed drove the truck in front of her blocking her between them. Then man, who was wearing a dirty Ore-Ida mechanic's jumpsuit, lifted her off her feet like an unwieldy package. In seconds, she found herself face face down on red leather seats that she remembered from the sex with Jed as being soft as butter. They were harder when she was being mashed face down and kneed in the back by Jed's friend zip who tied her hands behind her feet like a cow puncher.

Jed addressed her. "Me and Frankie O and the cock tease. Now you're gonna learn to say please, ain't ya?"

The squeeze on her lungs from Frankie's weight made it hard to suck in a breath. The smell of motor oil from the man on top of her and saddle oil from the leather under her was overwhelming."

"You wanna go first, Frankie O?" Jed asked, in a conversational tone. "Or we could try a twosome while she sucks your dick." He reached behind him and yanked Lydia's hair. "You're good at sucking dick, aren't you?"

She reared, trying to buck Frankie off her back. "Let me go!"

Jed kept up his patter as if she hadn't spoken. "No, I'll fuck her first and you can watch. You owe me for that bull shit you laid on me about my tires."

Lydia lifted her head yelling at Frankie. "Why are you doing this?"

"Don't you remember what Maggie Leary did to me? Interfering fat bitch." Jed paused. "I wish she was here so I could fuck her up too."

Frankie O dangled a roll of duct tape in front of her. "You going to shut up?" She shook her head at the duct tape. No one could hear her scream except the two psychos who were already in the cab with her.

Within minutes it looked like they were driving west on I-90 toward Look Out Pass. Frankie slid off her and slithered sideways through the opening into the front seat. He wasn't much bigger than she was. Scrawny and underfed enough to winkle through the bucket seats like an eel. Red angry welts pitted a ferret-thin face.

Jed fiddled with the radio as the truck drifted across a lane before he locked on to a country station. He sang through his adenoids to Shania Twain belting, "That Don't Impress Me Much" until Frankie told him they should drive up into the hills above Couer D'Alene Lake to the Shooting Range so Jed could show him how the Raptor could fly.

Jed was in favor of showing off his new truck but he had a million excuses about why he couldn't afford to get it dirty. He'd just had it detailed and the undercarriage had been steam cleaned and goddamn, it sucked when snow and mud caked under the LED skirt lights and fucked up the custom chrome hub caps. "I paid good spud money for the lift package that makes it look like she's UFO that can levitate ten feet off the ground!"

"What the hell is spud money?" Frankie wanted to know.

"It's money for being a Simplot."

Lydia knew immediately Jed was talking about a trust fund because she had one too, though her mom still insultingly called it an "allowance." She liked having the money to pay for the whatever she wanted but talking to Lorenza lately had made her wonder if it got in the way of being able to stand on her own two feet. It certainly wasn't helping her lie on them.

"My trust check doesn't come till next week. There's no way I'm going to I drive my new rig around town when it's pigged out." Jed's voice had a whining edge that hadn't been noticeable when all he had to say to her was "Harder!!" and "Yeah, right there!"

"You get a check every goddamn month?!!" The irony of someone receiving a regular check for nothing seemed to flabbergast Frankie. "I gotta sweat every fucking month to make rent!"

"You know my great granddad bought up all the land around here back in the day and turned it into French fries, don't you? How can you be an Ore-Ida mechanic and be so stupid you don't know that?" Jed swigged deeply from the bourbon bottle like it was Gatorade.

"You're an SOB." Frankie sighed. He waved off the bottle Jed wanted to hand him. Then, like he was bound and determined to get in at lick at the unfairness of life, he said, "Why the hell did you buy an off-roader if you're too chicken to take it off road then? Shoulda sprung for the Lamborghini."

Jed stiff armed Frankie with a closed fist, a quick, mean job that landed with a thump on his shoulder and Frankie's yowl. "Shut your pie hole. How I spend my money's none of your look out."

"Fuck," Jack Daniels was running off Frankie's face and neck as he wiped at the rivulets ineffectually. "Look what you made me do, dufus! You spilt most of the Jack." He held the amber bottle up in the bright beam of the headlights of an oncoming car.. \"It's almost shot."

This time Jed's fist struck Frankie in the cheek bones. "Fuck for brains! Don't get us stopped for DWI. " He jerked his thumb backwards toward Lydia in the back seat. "How'd we explain her?"

Jed stopped at an AmVets club to for more booze and beer. When they got back,

Jed let Frankie drive so he could get shit faced. He turned he attention back to Lydia and said,

"Now you'll see how fun it is to get beat up. Too bad Maggie Leary had a flat in the nut van. I passed her on '90. And flipped her off before I got to you."

Lydia couldn't see much except padded leather interior. Based on the lack of lights, and traffic way out here was sparse. Mostly she watched a new bottle of vodka being passed back and forth from Jed to Frankie like a relay baton.

Once the truck turned off the freeway onto a two lane road, she was thrown back and forth, unable to stop herself from hitting her head on the door and sliding the opposite way on every turn. Once, when the truck fishtailed like a dying salmon Jed warned Frankie, "Wreck my Raptor and I'll wreck you."

Frankie O drove with his skinny neck turtled down deep in his green jumpsuit. He looked like he was keeping his head tucked into its shell so it didn't get bitten off.

The truck ground up a series of hills. At one point, when the engine began to labor, Frankie O down shifted into four-wheel drive and said he wouldn't had to if Jed had Grippers or Nitto Grapplers instead of mud tires.

Blue-black trees. Unless white hills. An occasional house light gleamed like a candle in darkness but even those lonely glows died out into purple darkness as they powered up and up. She was close to throwing up from the switchbacks when suddenly the truck made a hard left. They bounced into something metallic with a loud crunch. Juddered to a stop.

Jed howled like a whipped dog. "Fucking shit for brains! What'd you hit?"

It turned out to be a beat-up refrigerator lying on its side in the snow. It was half-buried in a roughly graded clearing that was strewn with mattresses and oven ranges and shot out TVS that people had hauled up to what Jed and Frankie called the Shooting Range. The locals used it for target practice and it doubled as an illegal dump site.

"I should shoot your fucking foot off, you fucking piss ant!"

Jed was still squawking while he hauled Lydia out the back seat, dragging her by the shoulder that had gotten messed up back at NICC when Frankie manhandled her into the truck. Jed dumped her face first in the snow, then starting punching Frankie in the stomach till he was on his knees and holding his hands in front of his face and retching next to her.

The clearing had been dozed by a grader that used it for a turn around. Whiskey bottles, crushed beer cans, shell casings by the dozens, along with McDonald's boxes and Cheeto bags littered the trampled snow. On a sodden couch in the middle of the clearing, a Barca lounger sat like a throne not far from a shot-out TV. Ponderosa trees with hacked and broken branches lined the perimeter of the half-circle that served as a target zone.

When Frankie was able to stop retching, he said he'd gotten fucked up here at a kegger last weekend.

Jed approached her with a Bowie knife, then sawed at the zip ties. "Better pray now," he said. "Because you won't know how by the time I'm done."

\* \* \*

LYDIA BRUSHES AT SOMETHING FROZEN TO ONE EYE LIKE A CUT DIAMOND. The other eye is completely blocked by something sticky and wet. When she's able to focus on something overhead, Inky darkness is leaking light from a million pin pricks overhead.

A poke.

A hard shake.

Her head wobbles back and forth in a shimmy of pain.

For a second, she thinks that Jed is going to start in on her again.

No. Only Frankie O bending over and breathing something warm in her ear.

"Wake up!" He's yanking at her fucked up shoulder. His voice from as far off as the milky stars. "You can't go to sleep."

Frankie O keeps wrestling and pawing at her until she finds herself up on pin-prickled feet. She wobbles like a drunk till he steadies her by the elbow. She can't stop herself from leaning against his scrawny chest and the expression on his face is blue and grim. "Put this on." Now he's shoving a green ski jacket at her. Lydia feels the warmth on it from his body before she figures out he wants her to wear it. It smells of oil and sweat but it feels amazing. Soft and warm as a pillow.

"'M fine. 'M OK," she mumbles. All she wants to do is lie down and close her eyes again and go to sleep.

He continues to poke at her and manhandles her arms into the sleeves while he's spewing words she can barely hear in some incomprehensible language. "...all you gotta do is walk. Coupla' miles. S' all. Coupla miles, all downhill. When you get to the highway, just hitch."

She nods because she can tell he really wants her to understand something but everything out of his mouth sounds like sleep, go to sleep, keep walking, and you'll go to right to sleep.

She sways in cold wind, like a leaf. One sleeve skews off the fire in her shoulder. A silver zipper glints when she looks down at pale white legs. She's surprised to see that she's naked from the waist down. Her thighs are goose bumped like turkey wattle which Frankie ignores when he walks away.

"Not that way!" He's back. He re-aims her out of the clearing she remembers driving into years ago. Snow pockmarked with red bullet casings. She remembers lying in a drift with her hands and feet tied behind her. Her hands are free now, but her shoulder seizes up with red heat when she tries to move it,

A whiny torrent lifts over the rumble of an idling engine emanating like a ghost from the middle of a smoke plume. "Piss Ant! Move your pecker or I'm leaving!" It's Jed's voice coming from a long way off. His voice rises like a whiff of steam.

"You'll be OK once you get to the highway." Frankie O pulls the zipper up farther. Yanks the sleeves down to cover Lydia's blue-white wrists. Good thing I am wearing Smart Wool, she thinks, noting clumps of snow and ice crystals pilling the socks around her ankles. Smart wool for a dumb girl who only has to keep walking.

*CuntSuckDickShitForBrain,Cocksucker!* Frankie O hollers something back about holding his horses so a man can take a piss, then he lopes off in the direction of the noise like a wolf.

The truck fishtails out of the clearing in a smog of exhaust and sulfur yellow ight.

Jed, hangs out of the passenger window like a feral dog, hooting and barking. "Have a good time," Jed shouts. "Fuck all the coyotes you want!"

For a long time, the warbling sound of Good Night Irene reaches back to her with the growl of a grinding engine. It takes quite a while for her to raise her head. It take even longer to understand in a world of white and and black shadow she's alone.

She stumbles head down, following the big tire tracks, half-hunched over because if she stands up straight, she can't take in a full breath. She feels emptied out. A seepage from between her legs leaves a dark trail behind her. She wonders if her insides will leak out of her at the same time the the black covering of sky will fill in all the pinpricks above her. The dark trail she's leaving behind her is an unraveling thread.

Red fire burns a hollow between Lydia's legs.

Jed's face looms in and out of focus.

*On your knees, bitch. Ass in the air.*

She remembers a heavy weight grinding her face in the snow while the weight of an animal grunts and pants with a wet sound.

*She's had enough!*

*...teach the whore to shame me.*

Tall purple-black Ponderosa hunch over the road like impassive soldiers. A snow clump startles her with its whumpf, but soon, she's too tired to even look in the direction of more crashes, intermittent snow swirls.

Up until tonight, Lydia's relationship with Ned the cowboy has been transactional. Your dick. My lips. Your money. In and out like a cash machine.

Now she realizes that the impersonal is very personal. Her nose drips dark and wet onto the ground like a faucet. If she had Margaret's pipe wrench, she could fix it.

"Christ." Frankie O's intake of breath whooshes out in a gush. "He musta busted your nose."

Whatever Ned has done to her, it has affected her balance.

She pitches and yaws along the tire tracks like a rudderless ship. When she finds herself swaying at an edge that drops into thin air, she has to will her body to turn and stumble away from the invitation of nothingness.

Back in light-polluted Detroit, she used to think of the brightness of Idaho's stars as diamond-like and infinite. Now she sees that the opposite is true. The darkness is wearing off the crystalline sharpness of the stars overhead. The tunneling of her vision confirms that blackness is winning by emptying the world of light.

At first, Lydia tries to follow the ruts left by the truck wheels but that's a mistake. One foot skates out from underneath her on a sheen of ice. She sprawls painfully to her hands and knees. When she manages to wobble to her feet, she feels a thousand years older than before.

After that, she sticks to the deeper, packed snow between the tire tracks. She holds her arms out and toddles along like an old woman, body tensed as if expecting the worst. But hasn't the worst already happened at the clearing? How much worse can it get?

A confused memory comes to her of face-planting in front of a shot-out TV. Her eyes are level with the busted-out screen. Jed is kicking her in the back while her head repeatedly bangs against the woodgrain logo. Panasonic. Life is better in living color.

Jed back-handing her until she falls backwards over the door of a half-buried oven. She tried at first to hold her hands in front of her face but it isn't wasn't long before she gave up and curled on the ground like a grub, forcing Jed to yank her up and punch the stuffing out of her like a scarecrow.

Why not just lie back now and watch the darkness obliterate the stars?

She can't figure out where her Ferragamos went. The boots that are on her feet slop and galumph so she has to kick her toes forward as if she's skating on the moon. Jed tossed her pants in a ravine early, she remembers. Her pink thong is still rolled around one ankle like a wedding garter. The panties clump underfoot iwhen she takes a step but it takes more courage than she has to bend over to get it off. If she falls over, she doesn't believe she can stand back up.

Frankie O's coat smells like sweat and humanity. Frankie O didn't join Ned in the punch fest. He'd hovered in the background, looking worried and scared. He distracted Ned with a new beer when he started kicking her. And when the Bowie knife came out and Jed wanted to carve his initials in her face, Frankie magically found a tab of Ecstasy that he'd "been saving for an emergency."

After that, she was on her back looking set the stars wheel overhead while Jed and Frankie downed beer after beer in some kind of drinking game that involved slapping at each other's hands. Every time Jed lost, he had to drink, and by the time the Ecstasy kicked in, he was babbling at the stars and doing jumping jacks and yelling about lighting pinwheels and rooster rockets on the Fourth of July.

A long argument at some point about whether to take the girl or leave her behind. Jed wants to leave her on the mountain "so the bitch can learn her lesson." Frankie O says they've scared and fucked with her enough. He says she can ride in the truck bed if Ned is worried about his upholstery.

By then, Lydia has been lying naked or kneeling in the snow for hours. She has no opinion about going or staying. There is a state of grace when you are too fucked up to care.

What gets her hobbling forward again from where she stopped is the crunch of teeth on bones.

Twenty yards ahead, past a switch back that doubles back along a moonlit slope, a mountain lion crouches flat on all fours. It's chewing on something dark and steaming between its paws.

Yellow cougar eyes, split pupils, indifferent, full of disdain, sweep over her. The cougar's mouth clamps a rabbit with its bowels hanging out between razor sharp teeth.

Lydia is too numb to be afraid.

The cat isn't interested in her. It has already hunted and killed prey. After a few long seconds of it looking at her and her looking at it, the mountain lion picks up the bloody rabbit, and trots past her. It is going deeper into the wilderness. Back to a warm winter den.

It is the thought of the den that prompts Lydia to start searching at the foot of the spruce trees and Douglas firs and Ponderosas lining the road. Creatures sometimes bedded down in the tree wells, Cleo, her old hiking guide, told her a million years ago. Especially if the snow got deep. Deep, compacted snow in tree wells insulated the ground and kept forest animals warmer than bare frozen earth. Another of nature's survival strategies.

After the cat melts into dimness, she stumbles on. The white road becomes a treadmill. Black triangular trees. White overloaded branches. Even occasional snow crashes from overloaded branches can't jolt her out of her lethargy.

She has no clue how far or how long she's been walking since Frankie shoved her feet into his work boots and told her to not to stop. Time hasn't lost its meaning, it just feels pointless to put one foot in front of the other. Her feet have been numb since the clearing. She can't feel her nose or her lips. Even her thoughts seemed to be congealing and slowing as if the cold has worked from her naked skin deep inside her body.

As she plods along, she has a strange feeling that she exists in two planes of time.

She is at once hiking down the foothills of Wolf Ridge while she is also hiking up and down the trails of most of the national parks of the western United States.

She's on the hiking tour she took she was 15 that was billed as a "greatest hits" of America's National Parks: Yellowstone, Gran Targhee and the Tetons, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and Glacier Park in Montana, Rainier National Park, and the Pasayten Wilderness of the North Cascades.

The guide she fell in love with, a horse-faced graduate level botanist, was abee expert named Cleo. Cleo took Lydia under her wing because no one else would.

You were supposed to be at least 15 but because her 15^th^ birthday was in August, at the very end of the planned itinerary, the school organizers made an exception for her greased by a donation from her family. The age difference was a surefire way to exclude Lydia from the company of the majority of the other campers who were 16 or 17. Nobody, including the camp counselors, wanted to hang with a stick-thin, motor-mouth fourteen-year-old with low self-esteem which is how Lydia ended up trotting up and down 800 miles of high subalpine trails over ten weeks at Cleo's heels learning about high country flora and fauna.

The first two weeks of hiking were heinous but after the first 90 miles, all the kids acquired the speed and stamina of mountain goats. Lydia went from hating everyone and every moment to loving every minute of every day and finally, falling deeply in love with Cleo.

Cleo kept Lydia's mind busy, while forcing her to develop her visual skills, and she equipped Lydia with her own sketch book accompanied by a daily assignment. By the end of the summer, Lydia learned to find, identify, and record all kinds of plant species including the Latin names, of everything from the subvarieties of lupine to 21 varieties of Indian paint brush.

To her endless surprise, she loved cataloguing the endless variety of survival techniques of the high country plants.

Cleo had taken the guiding job so that she could work on her botanical research while getting paid to babysit. ("I put up with you little assholes because I get to be around the most beautiful plants in the world," she was always telling the group.) A research paper that was due when she got back to UC/San Francisco was supposed to be accompanied by an illustrated survey of all the botanical specimens that the bees fed on. Compared to Cleo's stubby, pedestrian pencil sketches, Lydia's drawings were minute and delicate with nuance and detail that surprised everyone, including herself. Soon, Lydia took over the identification and drawing tasks while Cleo worked on her hypothesese and conclusions.

Lydia had never been needed. She was used to being superfluous to a mother who shuttled her off to nannies or au pairs when she was little and later on, to expensive private schools and foreign tea vel. To be told what she was drawing was beautiful, that her eye for design and detail was good, that what she was doing was useful, shocked her. And when Cleo told her she was depending on her help, she fell head over heals in love.

She is thinking of that trip and all the delicate and wildly diverse plants of the high country that are now buried under the snow around her. In the brutally short growing season of the high country, pressured by extreme elevation, extreme winds, extreme cold, the summer plants shot up in a frenzy of fragile growth for survival. Indian paintbrush, lupine, shooting stars, glacier lilies, avalanche lilies mouse-on-a-stick, mats of clover, heart leaf arnica, purple asters, bear grass, popcorn plants, spreading phlox, red and pink and white heather, gillia gentian, monks hood, camas with deadly bulbs.

As long as Lydia can keep listing all the flowers and plants she had drawn, she keeps placing one foot in front of her. Thimble berry, salmon berry, wild strawberries, alpine raspberry, choke cherry, bitter brush, lady fern, sword fern, maiden hair ferns, deer fern. She wonders what is happening to the bitter brush and choke cherry and all the plants weighed down under her feet by the long months of snow. Were they crushed? Flattened? Or just dormant now under the crushing weight of the snow pack.

The locked drawer that held all the names must have been shaken loose by Jed's beating. Now that the punching and sex are over, she had the feeling that there is so little left of her, she isn't even sure she still exists.

Every plant had a creative strategy for surviving a harsh and unforgiving world. Some shoot their stalks up high and fast toward the brief face of the sun. Others spread low and suck the nutrients out of rocks and scrags and scree. The heathers fight each other for narrow ecological niches: red heather has larger, low-to-the-ground foliage and more red-pink blooms than its competitor, white heather, which is closer-to-the-ground and slender with a few creamy white bells.

She knows exactly where the sketch book is, even with her shaken brain pan. It is still wrapped at the bottom the locked trunk at the end of her bed at Healing House. After the fire at Inner Horizons when she looked at every the pages, she barely remembers the almost-15-year-old she had been, full of hope and usefulness that summer, face turned toward light and love for the briefest time.

It is when she runs out of flower names that she lets herself sink to her knees. It feels so good to stop walking.

Nothing moving in the stillness. A faint rushing throb in the pines. The windy sound of water in the creek that paralleled the road. A violin rub of a bare tree branch brushing a tree trunk makes an other-worldly moan that is almost human. and part animal.

She curls up on her side, bare knees tucked up to her chest in the zipped up jacket like she's been foreshortened into a baby. The soft snow under her feels oddly warm in contrast to the deep blue cold she feels creeping up from the frozen ground into her bones.

It is beautiful in the silvered moon light.

All around her the snow looks soft and pillowy. Tussocks and hillocks flatten to rumpled bed clothes. There are no more hills to climb. No more roads to descend. A soft build up of snow whitens her exposed thighs, a product of the freshening wind. Her calves blue in the silvery light, look like mottled meat shrink -wrapped in a freezer. She closes her eyes and lets darkness steal over her. She isn't cold. She isn't lonely.

She sees glacier lilies, so vibrantly yellow and sunny during their short lives before they are buried under snow for the rest of the year. What color will she be when the dark night of winter comes to an end? Whose face will she see looking down into hers when she opens her eyes to the sun?

*Find a place for this metaphor in opposition to OG's star gazing metaphor17*

\--Stars look like pinpricks in a black cloth. The impression she has is that milky light is leaking out of its black covering. Always before, she had thought of Idaho's stars---brighter than any stars you could see in light-polluted Detroit---were pushing infinite light at her from a great distance. Now she feels the opposite. Light is leaking from its source and soon, blackness will take over.

081716 Value of Sketchbook to Lydia

While everybody else talked about what they saved, Lydia floated out of the living room and followed her fourteen-year-old self on the trails she had hiked behind Gracie.

"Where's yours, Lydia? We've been through the whole pile." Darlene's voice, nasal and reedy, pulled her back to the present. She'd palmed the sketchbook under the pillow although she could see a corner of it sticking out in her peripheral vision.

She could have shown it. She could have held it up and then talked about her experience on the hiking tour like it didn't matter. She could have lied through her teeth and said it belonged to her mother and made up some sob story of how her grandpa had given it to her to inspire her. But she didn't.

Instead, she stood up and hopping around on one leg, then the other, while she pulled off her boots. "Ferragamos! \$1200 on sale!" she lied. She never bought anything on sale. It just cheapened things.

Everybody groaned. Reza blew a raspberry and muttered to Danny, "She's gotta show off."

Darlene gritted her teeth but she let her go ahead. "Tell us why, no grandstanding."

"Well..." Lydia was actually thinking about her La Sportiva hiking boots after the tour, nicely broken in, as comfortable and supportive as old friends. "...they're practical... and warm... and they're the only pair in Idaho, guaranteed."

"And?" Darlene prompted. "What do they mean to you."

"It was snowy and cold. I had to have something on my feet. Half of you ran out in your socks, like dumb shits."

Luckily, the hall clock rang like a school bell. Saved!

Darlene said with a level look at Lydia, "We'll revisit this subject in session. Somehow I doubt that those boots are something you can't live without."

So Darlene was disgusted, so what? Darlene was permanently disgusted with life.

The assignment was to relive the night of the fire without the smell of smoke and the panic. "Now that you've had a chance to think about it, go get the one thing from your room that you would have been sick about losing," Darlene said.

Amid the usual grousing and whining, the sound track of Healing House, Lydia went back to her room.

Esty was in her Lydia's closet, pointing at the white Judith Lieber bag ton the top shelf. It was a jeweled bag made in the shape of a winking cat. "Can I take that?" she wanted to know.

"It's not yours," Lydia said. "You're supposed to bring something you can't live without."

"Want the kitty," Esty said. "It's what I care about the most."

Hmmm. Maybe Darlene's stupid assignment was worth something. Lydia had no ide that the stupid cat bag meant so much to her. To her own surprise, she nodded. "Go ahead. But it's going to be hard to explain."

Estie's bestie? Lydia felt a sudden sense of nausea from the unwanted peak into Estie's narrow existence. What to do with it? Run the other way? Or just forget she had witnessed fat and naked longing?

"That\'s's mine," she said. "You're supposed to pick something of your own."

"I don't have anything."

"It was true. Estie's side of the room was a blank cell with a few hand-me-downs or stuff other kids left behind when they were leaving the program.

"Please." The look of naked desire on Estie's face was painful. Lydia was bent over the trunk at the foot of her bed, pawing through summer clothes and bikinis and stuff she wouldn't need until it got warm. She felt the leather before she saw it and it seemed to her that it was warm, as if she'd just set it down on a sunny rock on the trail.

"Fine," she said, surprising herself. "Just don't blame me if you get in trouble.

If naked desire was awful, cur-like gratitude was horrible, especially when Estie enveloped her in a whole body hug that smelled of old French fries and patchouli oil. "Ewww! Let go!" Lydia cried and bolted away from her ask if she'd been scalded.

Big Paul was, for once, surprisingly coherent. Usually he sait in a big lump and spoke in inarticulate monosyllables. The weird bunch of raggedy tatters looked like a pile of dreadlocks made out of cotton. "It's Blankie" he told them. As if to demonstrate, his meaty hand went to one of the tatters with a silky sheen and he stroked his cheek with it as if that explained everything.

"How old is it?" Darlene asked.

"19. Same as me."

"You've had it since you were a baby?"

He stroked his acne-scarred cheek very gently, while nodding.

"Very good, Paul. I'm glad you shared this."

Big Paul never looked anyone in the eye. Against his religion, people liked to say, but Lydia caught a shy sidelong glance at Darlene through extraordinarily long, black eyelashes. So he's really in there, she realized. Buried deep and hard, but not impossible to coax out.

Lydia was struck by how small and valueless most of the things they brought were. A bag of steely marbles (Reza), a child's ski hat with floppy beagle ears (Old Girl), a pair of stinky broken down basketball sneakers ("hey, they're Michael Jordan's!" was James's excuse). Even Danny brought a letter from her brother who was in Afghanistan.

Maybe her sketch book wasn't so bad. Maybe she should just bring it out and explain how the Park's tour had changed her. How Gracie's pride in her, her continuous interest, had made her feel both safe and cared for. Was that it? Had she fallen in love with a big, horse-faced woman with the world's biggest ass?

Gracie was kind to her. She kept an eye out for her. Warned her on the days when the elevation would be hard, checked in on her to tell her she was doing fine, looked at her drawings with a no-bull-shit eye and pointed out how to sharpen the details or correct the light or figure out a new composition. "That's interesting," she would say, tilting her head like a puzzled dog. Or, "I never would have thought of that."

080416 Lydia's Mountain Experience

At the next Process Group, Darlene said there was a change of protocol. Instead of talking about the daily grievances, she wanted to go around the room and tell what they saved when the fire started.

Lydia shrank down in her seat and kept out of eye contact with Darlene so she wouldn't start with her. No fucking way would she admit to saving an old beat-up sketch book she'd carried everywhere with her the summer she was fourteen.

Rachel shrugged like "doh." "I saved my photo album and the picture of my family from my bed side table."

"Why?" Darlene asked. "What do they mean to you?"

"I need them," she said. "They're irreplaceable."

Everybody laughed at James when he said he saved his high school letter sweater. "Hey! It was cold out. What's the big deal?" he protested. Even Lydia knew that basketball meant everything to James. It was all he thought about, all he was working to get back to in normal life.

Darlene probed at him. A heat seeking missle. Why the letter sweater rather than something else in his room. "My Michael Jordan shoes were at home," he said to more laughter.

"Nothing from your parents? Your sister? Another family member?"

James shook his head. "What can I say. I'm shallow." He looked away from Rachel when he admitted it. Too close to the truth.

"There's no right or wrong here," Darlene said. "It's just an opportunity to think constructively about what you care most about. What matters to you in life?"

Old Girl held up her ratty Hello Kitty backpack without saying anything, as if the dirty half-rubbed off illustration of the cat with the X'd out eye said everything.

"Anything you can add to help us understand why your pack is important to you?" said Darlene.

"It has clean under wear in it," Old Girl said.

Lydia, who made a habit of knowing what was in people's purses and packs, knew that at the bottom of Old Girl's pack was a small knitted hat with floppy ears like a beagle's. She'd pulled it out one day when she needed to borrow a pen and Old Girl said she could get one out of her pack. "Don't touch that! It's my baby brother's!" she's cried. Just to needle her, Lydia said, You've got your brother's hat in there. Why won't you admit it.

"Bitch!" Old Girl glared at her.

Darlene issued Old Girl a black mark; Lydia got another one. It was worth it. Bogarding her privacy, the little bitch. Well, two could play at that game.

Reza forgot his pants the night of the fire but he managed to escape with his pillow. "What?" he said when people laughed. "It take a long time to break one in the way I like it."

"Too bad he didn't mother himself with it," James muttered to Rachel. That got the Stinkeye from Darlene but the golden surfer boy didn't get a warning. Suck-up.

Only one person refused to play the game.. "Hey, I saved myself," said Danny. "What else matters." If that didn't say it all about Danny, nothing did.

When the circle of revelation got around to Lydia, she'd had enough time to figure out her lie. She'd stuffed the sketchbook with its detailed drawings of sub alpine flora and fauna down the front of her jacket. No one could possibly have seen it that night.

She'd stuffed the small sketch book in the back of her pajamas in her underwear so it wouldn't fall out. No one could possibly have seen it the night of the fire.

Why she'd grabbed it was not all that clear to Lydia. She hadn't drawn in it once, after the ten week hiking tour of the National Parks. It was one of those "get Lydia out of Rahel's hair" tours that was offered by the boarding school in Lausanne she went to while her mother lived in France.

They'd hiked through ten national parks in western US and Canada, a different park every week, making the grand tour of Yellowstone, Gran Targhee, Jackson Hole, Sequoia, Yosemite, Mt. St. Helen's, Mt. Rainier, the North Cascades, and Banff-Lake Louise plus a fewshe couldn't remember since the trails all melded together into one long trail of blue mountains and giant cedars and scree-strewn slopes. They tramped over 500 miles. After the first two weeks, when the foot blisters and sore legs subsided, twelve kids ranging from 15 to 18 became fitter than mountain goats. Two experienced guides led them, one of whom was a grad student getting a Ph.D in Botany, who took a liking to Lydia.

Lydia was fourteen, the baby of the group. Fifteen was the official cut-off but because her birthday fell during the last week of camp, they let her in under the wire.

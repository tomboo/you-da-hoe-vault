8:05 AM

EVERY TIME DR. HAZEY THINKS he can get back to his vacation brochures, the door to his office bangs open and all hell pours in.

Damn it.

He grits his teeth at the sight of Bruce and Darlene on his doorstep first thing in the day.

The most senior therapists at Inner Horizons are double teaming him and lobbying to get him to send them to Seattle for a conference on Evidence Based Anti-Suicide Modalities in Treating Borderline Anxiety Disorders at the University of Washington.

Hazey knew Marsha Linehan, the guru of Dialectical Behavior Therapy. He\'d seen the ancient scars on her wrist. She was a veteran cutter and a survivor of who knew how many suicide attempts not to mention a brilliant researcher with an international reputation.

\"We\'re falling behind the rest of the field,\" Darlene was saying. \"Here\'s an inexpensive way to give IH some DBT skills while we\'re getting CLE hours.\"

Hazey wished he\'d chosen a field that didn\'t have so many acronyms. CLE? Oh, yes, that was bogus credit hours so meant his therapists could keep up their podunk accreditation with the University of Idaho.

\"How much?\" he said.

\"\$3000 per person,\" Bruce hands him the shiny brochure that shows an adoring circle of acolytes surrounding a stern looking middle-aged woman in a white coat. Hazey has a vivid memory of Marsha Lineman as a post doc, swilling vodka and lime juice, telling a rowdy joke to a bunch of grad students while he served as her lowly assistant. Why hadn't he stayed in academia when he had the chance to advance his career instead of starting a clinic in rural Idaho, the worst place in America to be recognized by his peers?

\"And how many therapists need the hours?\"

Darlene hesitated, "Four\--plus me and Bruce.\"

Hazey perches on the corner of the mahogany desk and passes a hand over his eyes so he doesn't have to see the \$18,000 goose egg they want him to crap out.

\"You two go. That\'s it. Nobody else. Run a class on DBT for the staff when you get back.\"

A high-five glance flits between them and he sees how pleased they are by his pronouncement. The little shits. They had no intention of sending six people. They had just been working him so they could have their own private junket to Seattle. They were probably going to save on the hotel and per diem by sleeping in the same room.

Gretchen sticks her head in the door right after they leave and shoves a meal plan for the next month under his nose. \"Sign this, would you, Doc?\" Hadn\'t he signed the exact same meal plan last month? Oh what the hell. These kids need routine; it is all that keeps them from falling into chaos.

Dr. Hazey had just gotten rid of them when he is interrupted by a phone call from an irate parent of some current resident whose name he could barely recall. Rochelle? Rahel? Rachel Interlachen? The woman is livid about the fire and the fact that her niece has been in danger and their family hasn\'t even been alerted. So how is it you\'re calling me? He wonders until it becomes clear that the fire incident came up in the weekly therapy call with Bruce!! The little fuck-wit he\'d just agreed to send on paid vacation to Seattle! Bruce had lobbed the complaint like a greased pig over to the Founder of the Program. Christ! Did no one do his or her fucking jobs? He was eyeing a photo of the sands of Micronesia and letting the names Vanua and Vanu Atu linger in his mind like new and delicious words for coconut oil.

Another insistent Br---ing! Bring! of the phone halts his hand in the act of reaching for the Fiji brochure. He wants to ignore it. Wants desperately to have a Fiji fling, if only in his dreams. But Hazey, the good doctor, Hazey, who has managed to get through the day until this moment without aid of either upper or downer or even a paltry mood stabilizer, picks up the receiver and listens to a stentorian voice on the other end of the line.

"She did?\"

\"I\'m so glad."

\"Thank you for telling me.\"

By the time he hangs up from Ira Bronfmann, Chairman of the Board of the Seagram Distillery Corporation, now serving on the Security Exchange Commission, and grandfather and acting-guardian of Lydia Heinz Bronfmann, Dr. Hazey feels like he\'s inhaled a big tank of laughing gas.

Ira Bronfmann is *pleased* with Lydia\'s progress. Ira is *proud* that she is thinking of something other than herself or shopping. Ira is *convinced* that Idaho is doing his granddaughter a world of good.

Hazey nearly blew it and said, \"Really? I had no idea.\" But thankfully, Ira Bronfmann wants to talk and he wants Dr. Hazey to listen.

The last thing Ira says before he hangs up is, \"Thank you for helping Lydia grow up.\"

Hazey places the phone in its cradle and relaxes like a king back in his leather chair. He spins it around so he faces the icicle-fringed window that catches the glint of wintry sun. It is a pale and distant sun but to Hazey, it feels like he is bathed all over in the warmth of the equatorial sky. The breeze kissed the blue lake into white caps and all he sees is smooth sailing.

*ALTERNATIVE ENDING?*

9:00 AM

DR. HAZEY HANGS UP FROM US Bank with relief. He\'s been holding his breath ever since the fire and the specter of arson has raised its ugly head. He's been sick with worry that the fire marshal's questions will queer his business loan.

Ms. Vance, the bank manager, one of those brass balls types who wear a suit so she looks like a man, reports that Inner Horizons had passed their inspection \"with flying colors.\" This is after she\'s combed through his financials with a magnifying glass and a nit comb.

He reached in the bottom drawer for the bottle of Chivas Regal he keeps on hand. It is 9 AM in Idaho, which means it is 5 o'clock somewhere.

\"Here\'s to Inner Horizons' bottom line,\" he toasts. He is about to raise his glass to "me, my and mine" when Margaret O'Leary looms in his doorway. Damn, should have locked the damn door to keep the riffraff out, he thinks.

She raises her own fist like she is clinking an invisible glass to his and asks, \"Skoal? What are we celebrating?\"

Hazey decides what the hell and gestures expansively with his nearly full glass. \"Here\'s to Healing House II. US Bank just approved my expansion loan."

Margaret surprises him by reaching across the desk for his favorite coffee mug. She helps herself to a healthy slug of Chivas and clinks his glass sharply like the click of a service revolver. A swallow of Chivas slops from \"The Boss\'s Mug" onto his unmarred desk.

\"Great news, Doc! Here's to us!"

Why does Hazey feel like a gauntlet has just been thrown? Who was Margaret talking about with her cheery, inclusive "us"? The woman leans in planting both fists on the desk and fixes him with a smile that involved all her teeth and none of her eyes. "Sounds like perfect timing to renegotiate my employment.\"

Hazey thinks ruefully, the problem with employees is that that they all believe you work for them, not the other way around. If you've got a staff of fifty people, you've got fifty bosses telling you what to do.

\"I know about your drug use,\" Margaret says.

Hazey want his mug back. Plus the liquor she\'s just chugged. He stifles the impulse to move the Chivas bottle beyond her reach. "What are you implying?"

\"I\'m not implying anything. I know exactly how you\'re writing prescriptions for kids that have left the program and I know that you're taking their drugs."

Hazey inhales without thinking. A mouthful of Chivas burns a path down the wrong windpipe. Choking and hacking, he tries desperately to clear it and the next thing he knows, Margaret is behind his chair and she's pounding him on his back. Big hammering blows between his shoulder blades. The woman had the fists of a meat packer.

\"Stop! I'm...." He chokes, gurgles, snorts. "... OK.\"

\"It sounded like you needed the Heimlich.\"

\"I just swallowed wrong!"

"Oh, I think we both know you've done more than that," she said.

Neither party says a word for a long, pregnant minute. Hazey's pulse hammers in his veins and there is a pulling sensation in his scrotum like the woman has an unexpected grip on his shorts.

Finally, Hazey is the first to break the tension. He says stiffly, \"What do you intend to do with this information?\"

\"I don\'t intend anything,\" she says. "I'm taking Gretchen\'s job.\"

Is the woman insane? "Gretchen's been here ten years! She\'s a registered dietician. She has a Masters!"

\"So she's always reminding me."

\"I hate to say this, Margaret, but you\'re a Day Supervisor. That's a euphemism for a glorified babysitter. What makes you think you\'re qualified to take on Gretchen's role of Head Nutritionist?\"

"I can cook. She can't." If the woman had been born a mule, she'd be plopping her big ass in the middle of the road and braying.

Hazey tries reasoning with her. \"A dietician does a lot more than cook,\" Hazey says. "They balance the nutrition, plan the meals, track the calorie counts, manage dietary restrictions..."

\"I already do all that," Margaret reports. \"Gretchen just signs her name to my reports.\"

Feeling a pinch in his chest, Hazey automatically fumbles in his jacket pocket for the comfort of the pill bottle he keeps there. He is about to shake out a Xanax before it occurs to him that maybe this isn\'t the best time to indulge.

Meanwhile, Margaret is busy arranging a row of empty brown pill bottles on the front of his desk. \"Alison Levey. Paul Prentice. Jamal Rashid.\" She reads from each label before she glances up. \"I don't remember Jamal-must have been before my time.\" Eight of the names Margaret reads out were residents who'd left the Program in the last six months; the others had been gone for years.

\"Seriously, Doctor Hazey, you\'ll love my cooking. Better yet, the kids will love it. And look on the bright side. You won\'t have to listen to any more complaining."

Food complaints---particularly food complaints from paying parents--- were the bane of Hazey's existence. Just yesterday, he\'d fielded an irate call from the mother of Omar, a kid who frankly needed to lose 50 pounds. The mother accused Hazey of starving the boy. The fat kid could stuff himself for all Hazey cares, which is what he wanted to tell the helicoptering mother. Instead he told her he'd look into the issue and get back to her.

What does Gretchen make, anyway, Margaret wants to know.

\"None of your business!\"

\"It will be when I have full time hours plus full medical benefits and life insurance. I\'ll be the best employee you\'ve ever hired, I swear it.\"

The pill bottles in a line on the polished walnut look like soldiers on a firing line. Unfortunately, the Xanax bottle in his palm tingles like a magnetic pole calling out o the fillings in his teeth. "What would I tell Gretchen?\"

\"I\'ll take over Healing House and she can have Healing House II or whatever you call it when it's built. We\'ll split the duties and everything will work out fine.\"

\"And the prescriptions?\"

Margaret was already scooping the pill bottles off the desktop into a purse with an enormous mouth. \"What prescriptions?\" She says sweetly. \"I don\'t know anything about that.\"

She sashays out, taking The Bosses Mug with her.

Before the door is shut, Hazey is tossing back two Xanax with a half a glass of Chivas Regal.

By the time the relaxant kicks in, he has the answer for Omar\'s whining mother. He will be happy to report that Inner Horizons has just hired a highly qualified nutritionist, who's also an excellent cook who will meet the boy\'s exacting culinary standards, he is sure of it.

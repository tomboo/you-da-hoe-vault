**Chase**

A big-assed woman in a bulky sweatshirt that said, "Don't Mess with Marge" checked him in as if he'd won the Lottery and she got to cash in his ticket. "You're the newest addition to the Healing House family!" she said, with a bone-crushing grip.

Thankfully, Chase had managed to stash one last packet of cocaine under the insole of his Nikes. After Matt and Aldus, his two paid babysitters left him in Margaret's safe-keeping, he practically burned rubber to a small powder room off the living area.

Nineteen hours before, two Bible-spouting men with handcuffs and a Taser dragooned Chase away from his dorm room in Middlebury, Vermont, at the end of a three-day drug-and-booze fest preceded by months of an upsy-down-daisy-chain of 'luuds and amphetamines i.e. freshman year as he was enjoying it.

Matthias, a wiry, tense ex-Marine with "Jesus Loves Me" tattooed on his forearm, strip-searched Chase down to his socks and boxers. Aldus, the silent one who chain-popped Lifesavers and Nicoret gum, packed his duffle bag. Neither one stuck their nose into his running shoes, hence the heartfelt Hallelujah Chorus that Chase was singing as he shook out three lines of white powder next to the sink.

He Hoovered up his first line tin the manner of a starving man at an all-u-can-eat buffet, feeling a familiar knock against his ribs. He regretted that this was the last of his stash. How the hell he was going to replace it in the middle of fucking Idaho where his fucking parents had locked him up to stop him from having any fucking fun?

The fiesta had been draining out of his blood stream since Salt Lake City. The next white line was vital to maintain, he was thinking, when a movement out of the small square window arrested him.

A furry, feral creature with a bandit's black mask was staring at him through the glass with a look of disapproval. Chase reminded himself that this was good New Jersey shit. He'd stolen it from his dealer before he'd had a chance to even cut it. What the fuck would a raccoon know?

A gray ruff thickened the creature's neck. Black markings punctuated a pudgy gray-brown body. Arched over its back like a warning flag was a bushy black-and-white tail. When it rose up on its hind legs , Chase saw it was wearing a small yellow grapefruit like a beanie on its head.

Two lines of snow remained on the oak counter top. His blood cells beckoned while another part of his brain registered the squinting eyes visible under the rakishly tilted rind.

Hotchoo! Chase's abused sinuses felt as if he'd been snorting sand. A spray of red mist dotted the oak counter like a rash.

The creature raised gray fingers the size of tiny elf hands and lifted the grapefruit off its head and held it up like a chalice. When the raccoon began to nibble daintily at the fruit, it looked so much like Chase's mother, his heart bolted into quick-time. For an instant, he wondered if perhaps it was a good thing he was in Idaho at a psychiatric treatment center if he was going to be visited by a grapefruit-eating mother who seemed to have turned herself into a raccoon. This thought was replaced by a fat raccoon snarling behind the grapefruit eater with a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth.

A loud yowl rent the air. The sound reminded Chase of watching two 'hos cat-fighting in Times Square over the same john. A moil of striped fur, black muzzles, and slashing claws merged into a spinning, snapping circle of teeth.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Loud raps rattled the bathroom door. "Yo! You OK in there?" boomed Marge's voice.

"Uhhhh..." Chase's heart, working overtime from months of amphetamines, ratcheted up with the hissing and screeches. "Is it me?" Cbase's voice quavered. "Or is there a cat fight outside?"

"Son of a bitch!" On the other side of the door, Chase heard Marge's deep, indignant intake of breath. "The little motherfuckers!"

When he finally got himself out of the bathroom, he wandered the living and dining rooms, then peeked down a hall of closed doors, expecting Margaret to be up in his grill about how long he'd been in the pisser. Strangely, the homey living room with a lot of plaid couches sat empty. Silent and dim as a church.

Outside the picture window, under a white-trimmed square window that Chase realized belonged to the powder room he'd just left, half a dozen raccoons milled and snuffled among a row of garbage bins blanketed by snow.

The fur ball fight seemed over. A baby-sized raccoon teetered on the rim of a bin, then fell abruptly into its maw. A burly pale raccoon bobbed and shook, its head embedded in a yogurt container.

Chase tried to shake off the feeling that his heart was trying to carry off his body. Raccoons were a normal phenomenon in the Rocky Mountains. They'd even been seen in the alley on the upper Eastside of Manhattan behind the brownstone where Mom and Dad lived between an investment banker and a man who owned a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. The sight of big-assed Margaret stomping past the picture window with a big-ass shotgun raised to a big-ass shoulder brought the thought, Save me! to Chase's mind. She looked like Annie Oakley in black knee-high boots. Rifle pressed to one eye socket. Finger poised on the trigger.

It was one thing to go from a cute masked critter that looked like his mother wearing a grapefruit on its head to the same masked creature's head exploding into wet gray pieces all over the snow.

When Chase opened his eyes, there was no sign of life. No pointy moist muzzles. No infant-sized ashen fingers. Just a limp, headless carcass amid salad slime and crumpled funny papers and coffee grounds strewn across the driveway like the left-overs of a Mexican-themed frat party.

Chase sank down onto a couch, his chest in his throat. His heart pounded like a jackhammer until, in a burst of bright light, his brain split wide open like a grapefruit.

**Margaret**

By the time Margaret got back to the living room, she found the new arrival---Jason? Chasen?\-- laid out on a couch. She couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with the kid.

One minute she'd been waiting around for him to finish in the bathroom so she could explain the house rules and then she'd had to bolt outside with the paint gun to chase off the fucking raccoons who'd gotten into the garbage again before Dr. Hazey showed up with the Certification Review Team. She'd have done anything to avoid another shit fit now that Hazey had declared jihad on the 'coons. The kid had seemed OK when the escorts dropped him off, hung over some, probably a little strung out like every kid who came to Inner Journeys against their will.

At first, she thought he was napping.

She watched his chest for a minute, expecting to see it rise and fall. A pulse jumped erratically in his throat like a live wire. His pulse rate skittered so fast, she could barely count it. She flipped the kid up to sitting and forced his head down between his knees, holding him there like a rag doll while she speed-dialed 9-1-1. Shit in a shoe! Hazey didn't pay her enough to watch a kid barely out of high school die on the couch of heart failure.

Introduction: Making Sense of Place

A brief introduction will trace the evolution of the "sense of place" concept back more than three centuries, using examples by writers including eighteenth-century poet Alexander Pope to twenty-first century earth scientist Lauret Savoy. Readers will learn the origins of the term "sense of place" and its roots in the concept of *genius loci*---the "genius of the place."

**Part One: Approaching Places**

Chapter 1: Elements of Attachment

Sociologist Jennifer Cross has identified six kinds of attachments that people have with the place they live. She categorizes them this way:

1\) *biographical:* historical and/or familial ties;

2\) *spiritual:* emotional, intangible ties;

3\) *ideological:* moral or ethical feelings of responsibility;

4\) *narrative:* connection through story;

5\) *commodified:* based on particular decisions and lifestyle choices; and

6\) *dependent:* constrained by a lack of choice.

This first chapter will offer examples of these six categories of connection to place, looking at examples of literature that exemplify all six. This chapter also offers writing exercises to help writers explore their own attachment to "their place," wherever that may be. Chapter 1 will also introduce readers to the basic elements of place on the page: space; built and natural environments; climate, flora and fauna; and the varied aspects of custom, cuisine, conversation, and culture.

Chapter 2: Places We Live

Perhaps the most challenging place to render on the page is the most commonplace: our home. As Ralph Ellison famously put it, "If you don't know *where* you are, you don't know *who* you are."[^2] This chapter will begin by analyzing some famous literary home places, both real and imaged. It will look at homes as defined by the physical structure (Bleak House or Wuthering Heights), by small area (Mango Street or Walden Pond) and by larger area (Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi or Aracataca / Macondo, Colombia).

This chapter will lay out a series of writing exercises and methods for recreating one's home place on the page: from the house to the neighborhood to the metropolis. It will also explore internal and external definitions of neighborhoods and communities---and the political and economic forces acting upon them.

Chapter 3: Places We Work

We spend most of our waking hours at work, but we rarely write about those all-too-familiar environments. This chapter will explore the importance of the workplace in literature and offer tools for conveying varied worksites accurately and effectively. Examples of masterfully built "workplaces on the page" include Yusef Komunyakaa's Southern factory, John Nichols's agricultural fields, George Orwell's slum in Northern England, and Arundhati Roy's Kerala government office.

Chapter 4: Places We Play

From the baseball diamond to the backcountry nature trail, outdoor spaces present special opportunities and particular challenges for writers. In this chapter, writers will learn how to observe and recreate the great outdoors on the page, studying examples from novelist Don DeLillo, poets B.H. Fairchild and Martín Espada, and essayists Annie Dillard, Carolyn Finney, Thomas Fleischner, and John Muir.

This chapter will also explore the concept of "landscape," and how it developed from a term that referred to the built environment. As art historian Lucy Lippard points out in her book *Lure of the Local*: "The word landscape originated in the German fifteenth-century term *landschaft*---a shaped land, a cluster of temporary dwellings and more permanent houses, the antithesis of the wilderness surrounding it."[^3]

*A portion of this chapter is included with this proposal.*

Chapter 5: Places We Visit

Place-based writing is often conflated with travel writing, though the latter is a small subset of the former. It is a genre with significant logistical and ethical challenges, both of which will be explored here. As that old saw about travel writing goes, "If you are going to write about a place, it is best to stay less than two weeks or more than twenty years."

This chapter will focus on writing inspired by the shorter end of that timeframe, offering specific tools for writing about places where the writer is just passing through, taking inspiration from master writers-who-travel(ed), including Joan Didion, Ryszard Kapuściński, Barry Lopez, and Zora Neale Hurston.

This chapter will also explore the idea of "place" as a social construct, as something created and defined by the writer and the people about whom we write.

Chapter 6: Places We Fear

We often need to write about places that have been ravaged, or have ravaged us. Ecological destruction, climactic disruptions, war, and other human conflict or abuse can permanently taint the places where they occurred. Writing about fearful places---or places where fearful things have happened---requires special considerations. This chapter will study examples by authors including Edwidge Danticat, Michael Herr, John Hersey, and Bob Shacochis. The writing exercises will focus on how writers can engage with, or mentally return to, places that they fear.

Chapter 7: Places We Revere

Architectural historian John Brinkerhoff Jackson explains that sense of place "is an awkward and ambiguous modern translation of the Latin term *genius loci*. In classical times it meant not so much the place itself as the guardian divinity of that place... The visitor and the inhabitants were always aware of that benign presence and paid reverence to it on many occasions...."

He goes on to note that in contemporary times, "\[W\]e recognize that certain localities have an attraction which gives us a certain indefinable sense of well-being and which we want to return to, time and again. So that original notion of ritual, of repeated celebration or reverence, is still inherent in the phrase.[^4]

This chapter considers the specific constraints and responsibilities of writing about sacred, historical, and other special places. How can we focus attention on these important locations, without bringing too much attention to them? How can we avoid disrespect or appropriation? Authors including Linda Hogan, N. Scott Momaday, Alice Walker, and Terry Tempest Williams will help answer these questions.

**Part Two: Capturing Places**

Chapter 8: From Memory

Many of the places we want to convey on the page are no longer accessible to us; they have disappeared from our lives or from the world. This chapter focuses on strategies for coaxing detail from memory. Our memories are charged with---even determined by---emotion and individual temperament. Poet and essayist Frances McCue says that writing with a sense of place is that which "captures the torque between temperament and terrain." This chapter's exercises will help writers draw from a lifetime of memories and harness the energy created by that torque.

Chapter 9: From the Senses

We experience the world through our senses. Though we still speak of "the five senses" described by Socrates and Aristotle nearly 2,500 years ago, human perception is far more complex than sight-hearing-smell-taste-touch. This chapter demonstrates how writers can transform that complexity into compelling writing about place, using examples from Gretel Ehrlich, George Orwell, and Luis Alberto Urrea. Writing exercises will focus on the wide diversity of human perception, from proprioception (the sense of where each part of one's body is in space) to nociception (the sense of pain, which can be cutaneous, somatic, or visceral).

*A portion of this chapter is included as a sample with this proposal.*

Chapter 10: From Lived Experience

Perhaps the most effective place-based writing comes from careful observation done in situ. This chapter offers site-specific writing practices to evoke the physical and emotional elements of a place. It also reviews how writers can record elements of a location to improve their writing about it, through the use of photography, GPS coordinates, map-making, drawing, and audio or video recording. Exercises in this chapter draw upon hour-long and day-long series of writing prompts that my students (from both creative writing and environmental studies courses) have completed at art museums, city parks, farms and fields, urban streets, and wilderness areas.

Chapter 11: From Research

All too often, we must write about places we can't actually experience first-hand. This chapter offers a wide range of research tools for recreating places that we can know only second-hand. It includes an overview of how to complete this research, including learning the meanings of place names, drawing clues from landscape features shown on photographs or maps, and employing archival materials. This chapter draws examples from writers who have effectively recreated places that existed long ago or that the author was unable to experience, including Louise Erdrich, Lesley Hazelton, Adam Hochschild, and Jill Lepore.

Conclusion: Why Are You Here?

*Sense of Place on the Page* will conclude by considering how personal, cultural, political, and historical forces all play a part in determining where, specifically, we find ourselves in the world.[^5] This final chapter offers a series of exercises to help writers think about those forces at play in their lives---and how they might be considered in our place-based writing. It will also offer examples from writers---such as Norma Elía Cantú, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Natasha Tretheway---who address these large-scale forces in their writing about the places they call home.

*Sense of Place on the Page* will also include a robust annotated bibliography, offering detailed information about all the resources and works of literature referenced in the book.

**Online Companion Website**

As a companion to *Sense of Place on the Page*, I will create a website that offers a clearing house of information about place-based writing and related topics. The website will include:

- Links to literary journals that focus on place-based writing;

- Reading lists of creative nonfiction, short stories, novels, poetry, digital, and hybrid literary forms with a strong sense of place;

- Links to exemplary local websites about place-based writing from across the United States, as well as other English-speaking communities---because this is an inherently local literary form;

- More detailed writing exercises and a place for readers to contribute their own exercises and suggested readings; and

- Audio excerpts from the author interviews completed for *Sense of Place on the Page*.

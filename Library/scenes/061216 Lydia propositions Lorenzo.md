061216 Lydia propositions Lorenzo

She cleaned her boots with damp paper towels in the Lady's Room at the Student Union. Then, because she was thirsty from throwing up, she clawed in the bottom of her purse for enough change to buy a cup of coffee. Between the doughnuts and nail polish she'd bought to get rid of the Goth look, she was irked to find that she came up short.

Clown-boy with the rust-colored beard was still hunched in a chair at the same table. He was counting out and stacking small towers of pennies, dimes, and nickles and he looked up at her when she stopped at his side.

"I'll trade you a quickie for a cup of coffee," she said.

"What?" His broad freckled face looked blankly innocent. For a second, she wondered if he was fucking with her.

"You and me?" she said, gesturing over her shoulder toward the janitorial closet. "I know a good place where no one will see us."

"Do I know you?" he said.

"No, but I can fix that."

His pale blue eyes took looked guarded. He tilted his chair away from her as if he was removing himself from a distasteful situation. "I'm sorry. I don't do that." It sounded like he was politely turning down another helping at dinner.

"Aren't you into sex?"

"I'm, ah, not that kind\--." He started his sentence again and said, "I'm Mormon. I'm saving myself for my virgin wife."

The expression "virgin wife" was such an odd one that for a second, Lydia found herself stifling a laugh. What the hell was a "virgin" wife? A gaggle of slutty-looking NICC cheerleaders in short skirts that stretched over thighs the size of ham haunches yukked it up a few tables over. One was applying lipstick and making obscene kissy faces at the hatchet-faced Indian jock next to her. Not a virgin in sight, as far as Lydia could see.

"Don't you like it?" she asked.

"I don't know." He seemed to wince at the use of the word sex in conversation. "I've never done it."

"Just how old are you?"

"Nineteen. I'll be twenty in March."

Lydia's experience with men and boys was wide and deep. This was a first for her. A 19-year-old male virgin who had just turned down sex the way you'd turn down a serving of Brussels sprouts. Her second turn down of the day. James Olson and now this guy. Was she losing her touch?

The coffee cup steamed between them on the table top. "Go ahead. You should drink it while it's hot. I don't want it that much."

She could see his naked longing for caffeine in his hesitation. She wondered if she had a similar longing on her face when she'd blurted out, "Would you like a quickie?" If she had, clown-boy certainly wasn't buying what she was selling.

She nudged the cup towards him. "Seriously. At least one of us should get what we want."

At the first swallow of caffeine, his hang-dog expression was replaced by bliss. "Oh man," he said. "you have no idea how much I needed this."

Her hollow stomach gave a low gurgle and she tasted a faint but definite taste of bile. Oh, I think I do.

It turned out his name was Lorenzo. A Mormon from Hillsdale, a small town in Southern Utah. His stepdad had dumped him at a bus station in Salt Lake City with \$75 in cash and a warning to not come back to Hillsdale, if he knew what was good for him.

"So now you're going to school here?" Lydia gestured at the NICC students around them who were eating or cramming or shooting the shit with their friends.

"No," he said. "I just interviewed for a job in the kitchen here as a short order cook." He shrugged. "I didn't get it. They only hire work-study kids."

Lydia had never heard of work-study. The girl's school in Lausanne taught things like deportment and conversational etiquette and how to plan an eight-course meal with special emphasis on presentation and flower arrangement.

His eyes had lit up when she set the steaming cup in front of him. But now his expression was guarded. Or was it disgust? Not exactly the reaction Lydia was used to getting when she offered sex to a 19-year-old boy.

"You're not gay, are you?" She backtracked in her mind to see if she'd missed something obvious about the big and freckly man-boy. A fluttery wrist? A hip-swinging gait? Any of the small myriad ways gay men advertised what they were looking for. He sat stolid and monumental as a lumberjack or a fisherman in worn Carrhardt pants and an open plaid flannel shirt with a collarless Henley-style thermal shirt faintly pockmarked with dimples. He certainly didn't look like a metrosexual, not that they were thick on the ground in Idaho, nor a typical Stetson-and-Lee-jeans cowhand, who were.

"It's OK if you are, of course," she said hurriedly, lest he think she was prejudiced. "My best friend in Detroit is gay. I just thought you looked lonely."

The side of his wide mouth quirked up. "Well, you're right about that. You just---well, you took my by surprise. I'm not used to girls like you being friendly."

"What do you mean by 'girls like me?' Do you mean because I asked you to have sex or because I offered you a cup of coffee?"

"No, no." He spread massive freckled hands the size of baseball mitts out in a sweeping gesture. "It's just---sex is forbidden until marriage in the Mormon church." This sounded like a pronouncement that the earth was flat or the sun revolved around the earth. It was the way the world was, with no questions asked.

"I've been having sex since I was 14," Lydia volunteered.

"Are you married?"

What an odd question. She felt like she was having a conversation with an alien who didn't know the first thing about the natives.

"You're just jerking my chain, aren't you?" she said. "Everybody knows what a quickie is."

"I beg your pardon," he said. "I do know what they are but it's not anything I've ever done."

"Oh, you're gay. Aren't you?" She hurriedly backtracked so as not to offend. "I mean, that's fine. Perfectly OK with me. Your choice and all that." She realized she was grinning inanely and she'd never felt more uncomfortable in her life.

"I'm not gay. That's a mortal sin to a Mormon."

"Oh?"

"It's just -- we don't believe in sex outside marriage."

"That's...." Unusual? Different? She searched for vocabulary for any word that wasn't "insane."

For a brief instant, she realized they were both looking at each other in the manner of two people confronted by a wild animal at the door.

"Don't\--!"

"Maybe\--!"

They both spoke over each other in an attempt to find a common bone to throw in the direction of the threat.

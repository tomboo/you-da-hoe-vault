NEW + GOOD REPORT

More power of the Savage beast and her deadlines!

By editing Lydia's Death March scene, I somehow unblocked an epic blockage. Now I am sailing along, deeply engaged with the novel and edit. I'm on a serious roll.

In the last 2 weeks, my biggest accomplishment is to get a handle on the arc-of-change for my main character, OG. I feel like Lydia's work in the first 2 weeks, provided the a similar handle on her.

In Jan/Feb of this year, I worked on OG's character arc with a copious amount of writing: new scenes plus old scenes reimagined. All that work was buried in my notebooks. Over the last month, I have chipped away at transcribing almost all of that work. It's like freeing the buffalo hide that I will feed my tribe with for the next six months.

Unbelievably, I discovered that I have already made a huge dent in my rewrite of OG's opening to the novel in that Jan/Feb work. When I write in flow, I truly don't remember what I have written until I reread it. Now I feel hugely heartened that the Opening rewrite which I'll do last will be straight forward. It'll be fun to watch as I tie up the final knots.

TRICKY BITS

I see that I am not great at knowing how long an edit will take. I have been wildly optimistic to think I could craft 3 tight final scenes by 6/30. At the same time, I've made huge progress on them thus far and really have the makings of strong tight scenes that I will feel confident and happy about.

*Question 1: OK to pick 2 of the three scenes to deliver Monday?*

---OG Escapes from Healing House by drugging Charlene

---OG Escapes Rusty's Car Crash; Stays with Him till He Dies

---Ending: OG Gets a Ride to Light Out for the Territories

*Question 2: My goal for our Book Coach contract has changed. Now I think it would be more efficient to complete the Arc of Change (scene compilations) for both Lydia and OG with Kerry's feedback. What do you think?*

*Question 3: Is it a normal part of the process to renegotiate like this as I learn what holes need to be filled and what work is needed to fill them?*

FOCUSS FOR THE NEXT DEADLINE

My goal for the next deadline in mid-July is to complete the tight drafts of OG's final scenes. I want to compile a tight scene list of her Arc of Change. I'd like to pick 2 or 3 of those scenes (already written) and tight-edit them in order to earn her decision to keep moving at the end of the novel.

NEXT STEPS + ACTIONS

I am very happy and centered right now with my progress and plan to continue. I think the power of the deadline and my desire to complete my commitments is what the doctor ordered.

Let's Zoom after the mid-July deadline to reconnoiter.

042717 Lydia wait for James in bath rub

Four

Lydia waited for James in the unheated bathroom off the kitchen. She was standing in a cast iron tub the size of an iceberg. Naked from the waist down, she felt like she was orphaned on a block of ice.

In two hours---exactly one hour and 56 minutes, according to her Piaget watch, a birthday present from Grandpa Ben ---Lydia's mother Rahel was coming to visit . If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart.

She'd already checked her wallet. The \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse was safely tucked away. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black Goth nails and replace them with perfect white crescents. It cost \$60 bucks for a French manicure on New York's upper East Side and \$15 in Coeur d'Alene. The only good thing about YouDaHo.

Looking around at the oak veneer in the faux country bathroom---even the toilet seat was blond oak---Lydia made a note to herself to remember to stash her cheap-ass Betsey Johnson tote knock-off on Esty's side of the room.

Her mother had drilled it into her head that only poor people wore fakes. People with money know what\'s real.

Lydia had studied in Lausanne, Switzerland, at a girl's school for four years; went to private school for three years in Grosse Point when she lived with Grandpa Ben and Grandma Adele; then during a brief fling Rahel had with a Superintendent of Public Schools, she attended public school in Manhattan for less than a semester. Rahel took her out of PS #6 in a NY minute the day Lydia came home with head lice. Most of high school was spent back in Switzerland at another girl's school, this one in Zurich, where they taught her how to dress in deportment classes and she taught herself how to undress under the lacrosse bleachers with the assistant coach.

Even in authentic Jimmy Choos, Rahel would be faster than Lydia in Nikes. Her mother kept herself tiny as a ferret and she was always harping on Lydia to lose weight. If Lydia's weight went up two pounds, it was social suicide. What man would want you if you were fat?

The first thing Lydia planned to do after Rahel took off on Grandpa Ben's Lear jet was to stop in at Dunkin' Donuts and stuff herself with every cake donut and cream cruller on the shelf. She would imagine her mother looking down through the clouds at thirty-thousand feet while her daughter scarfed donut after donut. Then Lydia would open her mouth and vomit everything she'd swallowed into the maw of the second hand purse her mother had "refitted" for her birthday. That's what I think of your stinking birthday present, Mom.

What in hell was keeping James?

She pushed away the image of the new girl's head thumping the floor. The sightless eyes rolled up white in a thin gorgeous face. The wild drumming of her jerkingl feet. Lydia's Godzilla itch for sex, as relentless and bad as it was, was at least hidden on the inside of her body, out of sight with all the other horrible things she kept locked up. Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside while the world outside saw a petite and perfectly maintained body.

She had been hoping the new arrival last week would be a boy. Erase that. A hella-boy with a hella-Godzilla-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed on Friday morning when a tall, bleary-eyed black girl named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her she could only have herbal tea!

Inner Horizons was full of stupid rules. They were just as stupid as the boys who never wanted anything to do with Lydia besides sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped, the smell of sex trailing after them like skunk. Guys, including James were clueless. What a bunch of a spud duds. Once they got laid, did they realize she had nothing else to give? What else would you give a guy when you already gave them access to your body? No clue.

Yesterday after marathon monkey sex in the girl's restroom at Northern Idaho Community College when she was supposed to be in Sociology class, James had muttered, "I feel dirty."

She felt like he'd slapped her. "I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's..." James thought for a long moment as if trying to order his thoughts. "You're like a Hoover. So mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels ... ah... impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

James dangled a spent condom between his fingers like a rat corpse. What the shit, the thing was filled with his own sperm. You make me feel used, he told her.

That was how Lydia was feeling the longer James kept her waiting. She couldn't make up her mind whether she was Jonesing more for sex or for a confetti-covered cake donut. Both of them would go down in two minutes and but only one of them would come back up in a satisfying swirl of green and blue and pink.

That was the real reason she was locked up in Idaho.

Her orthodontist in Grosse Point ratted her out to Grandpa Ben and Grandma Adele when he told them that the back sides of her teeth were pitted as a middle-aged woman. What a shit show. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food, but there was no fucking way she could ever let herself be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was always so empty. No wonder when she looked in the mirror, she was always surprised to see her that she was really there.

When she was young, Lydia had loved to look at herself in the mirror.

Her first memory was of skating down the long mirrored hall of the big house in Grosse Point calling \"Mom\'s coming. Mom\'s coming!\" Her nanny had told her that her mother was coming home from Europe. For hours, four year old Lydia skated the main hall in her bare socks. Back and forth. Back and forth.

Grandma Adele finally told her she\'d wear out the floorboards if she didn\'t quit. What was funny about the memory is that Lydia remembered almost nothing about her mother's actual visit. A cloud of perfume, maybe. Her mother\'s low, assessing voice. \"My, you\'re not very big,\" she said, as if her size was somehow Lydia's fault.

It was the expectation of being judged that stuck with her. Her hair was too curly. Or her legs were too thin. Or her voice had too much Detroit in it. Once, Lydia heard her mother refer to her as "the little Jew." She learned later that it was the mother's blood that defined Jewishness and her comment didn't make sense.

It wasn't till much later, when she actually lived with her mother in New York, that she learned to have no expectations. Why she had such a visceral memory of watching herself slide along the waxed floor, she had no idea. That day, it felt like she was flying with her hands out ready to catch the thing that was coming with great joy.

It was only when she got it that she realized her hands were empty.

By the time James finally shoved the shower rings to the side, Lydia was already clawing her way up his long, thin body and scissoring her legs around his waist. She groped at his waist, trying to undo his belt buckle and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!" She really felt like the top of her head was going to blow off. She couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was halfway down his throat.

Suddenly, the bathroom door banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtain-ringed tub and settled on the toilet. James' eyes widened and locked with Lydia's and they both froze. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting when they heard the thunder of water in the toilet, then a quick flush.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard.

The door closed behind whoever it was and a pent-up laugh flew out of Lydia's mouth like a caged bird.

"Shit." James breathed into her ear. "That was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands, keeping them still.

"I can't. That new girl... I thought she was dying," James held her away from his body with stiffened arms.

I'm dying, Lydia thought, feeling an unfamiliar moment of empathy for the epileptic girl who'd just had her body kidnapped by a seizure. Her emptiness was unbearable enough without any flopping or jerking.

"You don't have to think! Just feel!" She thought he was kidding and tried again to haul at his belt buckle. "C'mon!"

"No! What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" She patted his zipper, looking for evidence of welcome. She found none and said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way she was flopping?"

Lydia tightened her thighs, wiry and toned from years of gymnastics and ballet, into a death grip. But James, who was a foot taller and ten times stronger, pushed her relentlessly down past his knees like a donut.

"Don't hold out on me!" she wailed.

"I'm not. It's just ..." James hesitated.

In the pause, she shot up and slapped his face as hard as she could.

"What the hell?" His cheek flushed bright red where her blow had lit his skin like a flare. "Why'd you do that!?"

"I need it!"

The flush reddened like a trouble light. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly turning me on."

"Limp dick!"

" What? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

"Fucking dickless wonder!"

They were both huffing like whales at the surface. Lydia felt a rising volcanic pressure in her chest that made it hard to breathe.

James was already backing away from her. He stepped out of the tub and the rings jangled like an alarm bell.

"You can't get it up!" she cried. "You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked with surprise.

"You weren't calling me names an hour ago!" James was talking about the quickie she gave him before breakfast up against the back wall of Healing House's garage while they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins the night before.

That was then, this is now, she thought. "Faggot!"

James had his hand on the white, porcelain door knob and for a deranged instant, Lydia had the impression he was fondling a skull.

"Why would I fuck you?" he said. "You're fucking crazy."

The bathroom door shut. A sound of bumping and clicking ice. Lydia let her body slide down in the tub until her head rested on the white porcelain edge. What she was feeling was the ice floe drifting away from land.

08232025 Thoughts about Two Mouth Redraft

I want to get OG to the Moose rescue quickly.

OG priorities:

OG feels hopeless at the start and her mood transforms to hopeful by the end

OG comes up with and drives the travois idea and makes it work

Moose in peril is getting tired after swimming in circles in freezing water for hours. It looks like it's beginning to lose hope, to want to give up, which OG can relate to

Backstory of how OG goes to the Smithsonian and visits the Native American exhibit that shows her the tribe running away from their ancestral lands away from the army

FRONT DOOR TO BARFLAND

OG waits at the front door in stillness while chaos rages around her.

She rides in the back to escape the noise; witnesses James and Lydia get separated

Rachel is exchanged for Lydia on the way

Josh makes a plan to hike with the slow pokes while he lets James lead the fitters so they can hike the the whole trail

ON THE TRAIL TO THE LAKE

AT THE LAKE WHERE THE MOOSE IS SWIMMING

They see that the moose has fallen through but they can't do anything

OG can't bear to see the creature drown; wants more than anything to save something, anything against all odds

OG comes up with travois idea

She emotionally blackmails James and Rachel into working with her by threatening to jump in the lake herself

James, Rachel & OG join forces, build the travois and break a narrow channel

The moose derails their plans by refusing to swim into the channel, so they throw rocks at it and James knocks one antler off

The moose climbs out of the Lake and let's loose a far like a trumpet blast and all 3 of them dance around with an alien feeling of hope

Josh finally arrives and they extort pizza out of him for not telling what they did

Scene locations

HH entryway

Van ride in Barfland

Hike uphill on snowshoes where they leave slowpokes behind

Moose rescue at Two Mouth Lake

Unclear how to break up the genes between OG an James

OG has to narrate/present in close-third POV the backstory of the travois and the rescue plan

Maybe James picks up the snow shoe hike scene where he bonds with Rachel as friends after Lydia is sent back to HH for punishment. James reveal more about OG: what she looks like, how crazy & scary she is, plus his interaction with Rachel

08252025 James POV on Moose rescue

James was embarrassed at his bad aim. He meant to hit the moose in its broad ass but the wonky shape and the moose's treading motion made the stone ricochet and smack one side of the antlers like a rifle shot. He was amazed that half the antler broke off, leaving a bloody round spot where the antler was anchored like a third eye. It sank like a stone, and weirdly, as if losing the a part of the mighty rack lightened its load, the moose stopped circling where it had fallen in and entered the channels they had broken with some whinnying and whale-eyed head shaking that was painful to see, especially since it was bleeding.

OG focused on the rainbow of water droplets that the moose's hide scattered against the blue sky.

James focused on the antler he knocked off and it seemed to him that the very tired creature was able to stagger onto shore because he'd knocked so much weight off its neck.

Maybe the bridge of Two Mouth Rescue is how James and Rachel bond, as if the electricity that sparked between them in her epileptic seizure made stupid small talk between them unnecessary. When you've seen someone seized by unseen hands and shaken till their eyes roll up in their skull, it pretty much quells the need to ask where someone is from and what they're majoring in at school.

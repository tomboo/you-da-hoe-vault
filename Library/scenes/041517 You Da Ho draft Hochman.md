ONE

Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy when all you had to go on were the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Nine young adults--- "YAs," as the staff at Inner Horizons called them to differentiate them from the "ADOs" who were 17 and under and equally immature--- all straggled into the living room for Process Group. People dropped or flopped or lay curled up in fetal position on three couches, arranged in their usual off-kilter circle, before the meditation gong rang at ten AM.

Healing House's rust and gold tones and nubbly beige rugs and heavy oak looked Idaho-homey. Bland landscape paintings on the walls matched the bland, jmuted plaid on two couches. The oldest, most comfortable couch was the one people fought over. It was upholstered in a jumble of small black and gold letters that no one could read. It was a decor that reminded Old Girl of home in the worst way. It made her remember what used to be home while being a million miles away from it.

Darlene, the therapist on duty, staked out the sacred wingback chair. She called Process Group to order. And then introduced the newest member of the Inner Horizons team like a cheerleader -- "Meet Rachel Interlachen! Yay!"

On the weekend, Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two ex-cops in matching ski jackets and T*rust in God, Buy a Gun* baseball caps. That meant Rachel's mom and dad had paid a bundle to have their flipped out, freaked out, raging mad, or catatonically comatose daughter escorted to Idaho by personal guard to get her into treatment.

Rachel, a tall girl with very dark skin and a hollow face, wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." On her eggplant-colored wrists, there were raised horizontal scars. Not vertical. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like most of the girls in the program, including herself.

Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a bitch-faced cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Old Girl tuned out Darlene's introduction. She contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear on the eave from the ottoman she'd moved near the window. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the largest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth that lined the eave. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

A curtain of snow cut off any hint of the massive Ponderosa pines that ringed the yard. It had started falling last October and was apparently going to keep on falling until May, Dim sulfurous light beat its way through the gloom.

Old Girl was eleven when she made her first suicide attempt. She had raided the medicine cabinet at her guardians' house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was that Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the universe along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed caplets and fish oil jammed the shelves, but Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's most embarrassing way to go?

At 17, after a year and a half in Adolescents, Old Girl now applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to kill herself. Nothing gross, for example. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor who thought someone had pushed her beyond the ropes---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water she expelled so hard that she burst a blood vessel in one eye ---all fluids were verboten. Double-ditto road rash, like the kind she got when she'd fallen out of Uncle David's Buick turning a corner on the way home from picking her up at middle school. Her body weight carried her out the unlatched door and she learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. It wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken arm and the harrowing experience of having gravel picked out of her hip with forceps.

Hanging? Definitely off the approved list. The big objection to asphyxiation was something she'd read about how your tongue swells up three times its normal size and then hangs out of your mouth like a brown banana. No thank you.

When Old Girl moved from Ads to YAs after New Years, she left her single room at Calm Cottage ---don't even get her started on the Program's stupid names---and moved into Healing House which was 15 miles from Couer d'Alene. The property bordered on the Kootenai National Forest. Next door on the other side was the dump.

She couldn't see any improvement in the level of maturity from Ads to YAs, unless she counted the fluency in psychobabble. The first thing new resident learned was to spout on like paid professionals about accountability and personal validation and developmental delays.

Healing House was also a lot more beat up than Calm Cottage. It was a one story ranch house. Old Girl assumed that was to prevent people from jumping. The living area separated two sleeping wings that angled away from each other. The wings were named for old Indian tribes: girls lived in the Flat Head; boys slept in the Black Feet wing. It took about one nanosecond for the wing names to devolve to the Fat Asses and the Black Heads. Somewhere in Dr. Hazey's small empire of repurposed residences around town, he had a manor home named for the Shoshones where the Show Ponies cavorted.

Naturally Fat Asses couldn't fraternize with Black Heads, and vice versa. Residents ate together, processed together, recreated together, and slept by themselves. God forbid you actually got close to anyone.

The wall thermometer outside read 28 degrees. An hour before, it was 23 degrees. Yippee! Idaho's definition of spring.

At breakfast, she'd overheard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the fix-it guy who picked up the trash whenever he felt like it. Margaret told him to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl, who was consumed by thoughts of suicide, that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery.

How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The insistence in Margaret's loud voice that morning made it seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who drove a rackety ancient truck that held double stacked rows of jouncing barrels. Maybe melting was the key. The icicle dripped moisture when it warmed up during the day, then refroze into lethal weapons at night.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her suicide attempts---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straight hair fan out like a sun storm in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process of dreads had squeezed the copper out of her hair. Now it looked dull as cardboard. Death would pale her freckles; she supposed. Would it also flatten her hooked nose?

Usually she covered her strange proportions with baggy jeans or dark shapeless sweats. Her long legs made her look like a stork with the heavy breast of a turkey. The Fedora hat she wore to look hip wasn't very practical when it was freezing. She would have to carry it in her backpack and wear the black, pilling ski hat with the earflaps until the last minute.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job.

Margaret would have to wield the scissors. Anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Lydia Bronfman was a cutter. She had lost the argument about who had to process first. She was also a nympho and bulimic and the only child from some famous beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the mid-west in her nasal singsong Accountability Letter for fucking Axel Friedman, her therapist. Everybody was mad at Lydia for getting Axel fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why Lydia was apologizing. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall since she had sex with everybody. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat alone in the corner, could count that high.

Lydia channeled Marilyn Monroe while she listed behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing in a breathy voice. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she said, enjoying her audience. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody was saying."

Darlene rapped her clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by dime-sized sapphire earrings the size of dimes. "How can I take ownership if I don't tell you what I did?"

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Old Girl had a hard time sleeping because her mind was too busy fabricating scenes of her death. She liked scenarios that were as plot driven as mysteries. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Vera Wang dresses. Weather and setting, depending on her mood, varied between dark and creep-meister or grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she would imagine a fishing boat that sailed on oblivious to a body falling out of the sky. Tragedy didn't have to slap you in the face.

She wondered how much warmer it had to get to make the icicle do its work. If she watched the temperature during Process Group three times a week and checked it before dinner every day, she'd get a read on the melting and refreezing progress. The problem with real life was that there was so little you could control.

"Angela! Wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice, cut into her daydream. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle, Angela," Darlene said.

Old Girl shook her head. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally would *not* answer to the name she'd been given before her family vanished. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and an ache in her throat from having her stomach pumped, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, the new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?" said Darlene.

"I don't know anybody named Angela."

"I'm sorry. Would Old Girl please join us?" Darlene put air quotes around the name "Old Girl."

The pleasures of double homicide-suicide were in her mind as she swiveled obediently back to the group. A black-and-white photo gallery took up one wall of the living room. Thirty or so people from the early 20^th^ Century were eyeing Process Group with judgmental eyes. Old Girl wondered what the old street sweeper at work with a hand-made broom or the brick maker who carried hundreds of pounds of bricks on his shoulder would make of the whining and rationalizing and griping and blaming and circle-jerking that defined processing.

On the bright side, she added the number 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Lydia was now blabbering about how she'd coerced a police officer with a blowjob. Her short black curls bobbed over a pink cashmere sweater. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene made a note, and then flipped to a clean page on the clipboard.

"It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist's shake up after Axel's departure.

Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved to Young Adults. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized founder Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from the get-go. A Yale degree in psychiatry on Hazey's wall said he specialized in Adolescents, probably because he still was one, though the man was practically senile. She'd seen the year 1986 on one of a dozen diplomas mounted on his office wall one day when she was too wound up to sit during session. That would mean Hazey had to be what... almost fifty?

James Olson, the blonde, quiet surfer from Malibu, California, now had the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd said in one of those tense, shame-fests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get up. He was saying, "I traded my Revos for the candy," when Darlene wanted to know how he could afford Jelly Bellies on his \$5-a-week snack allowance.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high. Darlene wanted to know whom he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, his room mate and a meth-addict motor-mouth, had supplied the candy because Reza's New York Jets cap had the Revos hanging off the back of it. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. After three months without running away, Young Adults were allowed to take 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with his trade. At Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex. Ching-ching-ching. A galaxy of Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, another drip of moisture beaded up and rolled down the icicle to the edge of the eaves. It hung there as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions. Time thinned until Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time seven more people processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism --- if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it--- and then it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged her to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

The curtain of streaming snow was now so thick it cut off any hint of the blue-black wall of fir trees that ringed the yard. The sun hung out there somewhere. Too weak and wan to do more than ooze sulfurous yellow light through the swirling flakes.

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced outside,then at the ceiling as if she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's failures had aged her. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled slowly backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

FIND A PLACE FOR

Time was maddeningly elastic at Inner Horizons. You were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards if you fucked up. The clock ran forward for short periods but if you earned a demerit, say, for failing to take the trash out or fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed, or you refused to participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during Process Group like the one going on right now, the clock would turn around and run backward and taunting away from you. Old Girl had experienced heading toward a weekend recreational passes or a once, a chance for a weeklong trip home to Aunt Peggy and Uncle David, and just when she thought she was close to getting on a plane, the crazy clock would rewind and she'd find herself back at ground zero.

If she had known the clock was broken, she could have accepted it but the fact that the clock ran fast sometimes and slow at others and then took a god-awful leap backward to put her at zero over and over again made her hopeless with despair.

Two

HAZEY CALLED MARGARET INTO HIS office at 9 AM. Gretchen, the nutritionist, shot her a Grinchy smile. Shit in a shoe! Had the witch ratted Margaret out for saying the oatmeal sucked?

Margaret needed her crappy, low paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional psychiatric treatment facility West of the Mississippi." That's what Darlene, who'd been trying to land another job for months, had told a colleague that morning on the phone.

Margaret couldn't afford to leave, no matter how crappy the pay. Her husband, Hank, ruptured a disk moving a 300-pound patient at his job as a nurse at Benewah Health almost a year ago. They'd been living on one income ever since. The taxes on their 10-acre farm were due next month. She had no idea how she was going to pay them.

Hazey sat king-like behind his gleaming walnut desk. Not a paper on it. Only a folder and an expensive fountain pen the shape of a silver bullet.

\"Gretchen said you contravened her authority and questioned her personal worth in front of the residents.\" Hazey loved big words with chewy syllables. In fact, what Margaret had said to Gretchen Beener, possibly the only trained dietician in the world who couldn't follow a recipe for oatmeal, was, \"Are you trying to poison them? This shit tastes like charcoal."

\"The oatmeal was burned,\" Margaret said carefully. \"The kids were complaining that it tasted foul.\"

\"They\'re always complaining,\" he said. \"They\'re kids.\"

Well, Hazey had that right. Even though all the kids in the program had psychiatric issues, they were still, at heart, kids. Quick to laugh at Margaret's dumb jokes. Quick to whine and complain. Quick to point out the disappointing behavior of adults. Just like her own kids in their teenage years, just more fucked up.

\"I\'m a really good cook,\" Margaret said. "I could take over breakfast. Gretchen's always complaining she doesn\'t have enough time for meal planning.\" Really, she was always complaining that she needed a cigarette, which perhaps accounted for the fact that every taste bud on her tongue was dead.

Hazey frowned down at a glossy color brochure with a picture of a tropical blue ocean and palm trees for so long Margaret wondered if he\'d forgotten how to read.

She waited a decent amount of time. When he didn't respond, she asked, "Is everything OK?\"

\"I need a vacation. The stress is killing me.\"

Doctor Hazey didn\'t look stressed. He was reclined in a leather chair with his feet on the desk. At 49, the same age as Margaret, he looked like he took care of himself a lot better than she did. A tall tweedy man with gelled salt-and-pepper hair, he wore his usual professorial sport jacket with suede elbow patches and dress slacks. The paisleys in his tie looked like red eyeballs.

Margaret couldn't take her eyes off the shoes that were thrust in her field of vision. One was a black wingtip with a shiny, flesh-colored sole. The other shoe was brown. A wingtip, but scuffed on a worn black sole.

"Dr. Hazey, do you know your shoes don\'t match?\"

He slid the palm trees over a fraction of an inch and peered at his feet. They looked like two narrow barges on the lake of the desk. The news seemed to take a long time to reach his brain. \"I can\'t meet Lydia Bronfmann's mother in these.\"

Lydia's mom was making a fly-by? The only family that Margaret knew about was Lydia's paternal grandparents, the ones who made a fortune in liquor in Michigan. Margaret racked her brain and couldn't recall Lydia receiving any phone calls or letters.

"I thought her grandparents had custody?"

Hazey shook his head. Not a hair moved. "Her mother has custody but she has to see Lydia once a quarter or she loses it."

In Sandpoint, Idaho, where Margaret grew up, custody was when they took you in the back of a police car to the Cottonwood penitentiary.

"Lydia said she wouldn't talk to her." Hazey sighed. He flipped to a page of elderly sunbathers without wrinkles near a cerulean sea.

"Look on the bright side. She probably won't notice your shoes," Margaret said.

Whatever Hazey meant to tell her when he called her into his office got co-opted by the shoe crisis. Ten minutes later, Margaret found herself behind the wheel of Hazey's Lexus SUV. She was amazed to drive a car with heated leather seats. Only 1900 miles on the odometer.

It was easy to find Hazey's enormous glass and concrete house on the west shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene. It was the only aggressively contemporary place in a neighborhood of log houses that were built to look like cabins but were five times larger than the one Margaret had grown up in.

Hazey's driveway was clear of snow. Dry as a desert. Shit and Canola! He had a *heated* driveway?

Margaret's lower back winged at the sight of river-blue and rust-streaked slate, the only spot of color in a uniformly white neighborhood. She'd spent an hour that morning shoveling her ten-year-old Suburban out of the rutted country lane she and Hank lived on. Hank couldn't lift a bag of dog food since the accident.

Normally the fact that Hazey made more money than she and Hank would ever see in a lifetime didn't bother her. But was a 5% raise too much to ask?

Hazey was known to call Inner Horizons an albatross around his neck or when he was in a bad mood, a vampire that sucked his blood.

If Inner Horizon's was a vampire, quite a bit of blood had been sucked into building the glassed-in, two-story entry. Gleaming black wood floors. A red and black art rug with a zigzag pattern that was repeated in exactly the reverse order in the living room. Margaret's dream of having an electric garage door opener embarrassed her for its poverty of the imagination.

By the time she worked her way back to the master bedroom, passing not one but *two* white sofas that would have stayed clean in Margaret's house for less than five minutes, she was convinced Hazey truly was insane.

Some forty pairs of shoes were arranged in mahogany cubbyholes. Anybody could make the Hazey's mistake with so many pairs of shoes, she thought, except that the chandelier in the closet was big enough to light up Chicago. Who would put a chandelier with a million crystals where no one could see it? Margaret wondered for perhaps the thousandth time, had getting a Ph.D. replaced Dr. Hazey's common sense?

She was about to leave by the side door in the kitchen when she heard the clanging of garbage bins. Out front, she spotted Rusty Harrow, who picked up trash for all the Inner Horizon's facilities. Unincorporated Kootenai County was too backward to have its own garbage service.

Rusty was pawing deep in a garbage bin, occasionally holding up junk to his inspection. Probably collecting anything salvageable to sell at the dump he'd inherited from his old man. Margaret shrank back from the kitchen window so she wouldn't be seen.

There was something off about Rusty Harrow. Actually, there was something off about all the Harrows, starting with the old man, Stan Harrow, who started the dump back in the fifties. It was hidden on the other side of the butte from Healing House about a mile and a half as the crow flew, but five miles away by dirt road.

Stan Harrow beat the crap out of those kids. Three of the Harrow boys were older than Margaret and Rusty was in her grade through elementary school to whatever year he dropped out of high school. She still remembered him coming to school with occasional bruises and black eyes. Once when she sat behind him in the 8^th^ grade, a trail of dried blood ran out of his ear.

These days, you'd call CPS. Back then, everybody turned a blind eye. What people did at home was their business.

No wonder all of Rusty's brothers and the one sister---Olga? Helga? --got the hell out as soon as they could. All except Rusty who'd inexplicably stayed on. When Stan died in a mysterious trailer fire, Rusty took over the dump and made a living picking up from anybody willing to pay him under the table.

Now and then, she'd see him one of the six other facilities that comprised Hazey's psychiatric empire. He was still driving his old man's ancient stake-bed truck. Amazing the old junker still ran. She hadn't talked to him in years, other than to yell at him for leaving the bins overturned in the driveway. He looked like time had been hard on him. He'd always been built like a fireplug, but now his black, greasy hair was receding and he'd gone to flab in the gut. His shoulders were powerful and muscled from a lifetime of hefting trash barrels. Margaret still remembered the musty, feral smell that trailed him in the halls of high school and wondered if he was still allergic to bathing.

The smell of smoke wafted by Margaret's nose from the cat door. Damn. Now Rusty was taking a smoke break.

Margaret supposed Hazey had contracted with him to pick up trash here. Haley probably buried his personal fees in with the business bills. Just one more way bosses made money and people like Margaret didn't.

She wandered past a glossy black dining table with red leather chairs. A sad grouping of water-starved poinsettias ran down the center. Maybe it used to look festive but now, a month after Christmas, pale spindly arms reached weakly for the sun. Withered leaves dirtied the black veneer.

Where was Hazey's housekeeper? Margaret had counted nine Grape-nuts-encrusted cereal bowls in the sink. When she looked in the fridge, there was a single carton of 1% milk and four bottles of Röderer champagne. Margaret's Costco-stocked cupboards and jars of home canned fruit and a freezer half full of Sausage, the pig Hank had raised and butchered last fall, made her life look pretty full. Did the man eat out every meal except breakfast?

What a life.

By the time she wandered back to the master bathroom, she had to take a pee. She resolutely refused to look in the black low-slung toilet. Some things you just didn't want to know about your employer.

Clearly, the man didn't know how to pick up after himself. His bed was unmade. Dirty tee shirts and balled up underwear and a pair of pajama bottoms dotted the carpet. A certain dishevelment had cropped up in Hazey's dress after Alma's departure. She preferred thinking about her boss as an overspending, luxury-flaunting chucklehead than a lonely, slightly down-at-the-heels man unraveling at the seams like his pajamas. She opened the medicine cabinet to look for an Excedrin and did a double take.

Holy shit!

Hazey\'s cabinet wasn\'t just a medicine cabinet; it was the whole drug cornucopia that Inner Horizons kept stocked for its residents. Magically reconstituted in the director's bathroom! Her first thought was that Hazey must have been dying. HIV/AIDS? But Hazey seemed completely asexual. Uninterested in either sex. So that didn't fit.

She read labels for a prescription for Klonopin. Another for Atavan. Diazepam. Valium. Delaudid. Tirazepam. A bottle of Clonazepam prescribed to April Cohen whom Margaret remembered as a New Yorker with the investment banker dad who had moved his daughter to McLain when Harvard opened their new anorexia wing.

She reached for a bottle of Adderall; this one belonged to Reza Silverstein. Reza was the motor mouth ADHD kid from Camden, New Jersey, who couldn't sit still for love nor money. Hazey had gained weight after Alma's departure but a week or two ago, he'd been bragging about how he'd lost twenty pounds "just like that!" He punctuated how easy it was with a snap of his fingers. Just say no, he'd said. Was her boss saying No to food while he said Yes to Reza Silverstein's Adderall?

When Angela Livengood's name showed up on a bottle of Lorazepam, Margaret's maternal hackles went up.

Old Girl had a hell of a time sleeping. The kid was famous with the Night Supervisors as a card shark. It was common knowledge among the night staff if you needed help staying awake on your shift, all you had to do was walk by Old Girl's room with a heavy tread. She'd come right out with a deck of cards.

Margaret liked Old Girl. She was wicked funny. Never complained. Personally, she would have preferred that Old Girl would bitch and moan or even howl at the moon if it helped relieve her depression.

That morning, Old Girl had asked Margaret about the danger from falling icicles. "You're not thinking of standing under one are you?" Margaret had asked.

"What---you think I've got a hole in my head?"

"No, but I think you might want one."

"You never let me get away with anything!"

"Who would I have to bug if you weren't around?"

Old Girl had flipped one floppy deadlock away off her forehead and sighed. "Of all nut houses in the world, I get the one with Mother Fucking Teresa."

By the time Margaret read all the labels on the shelves, she counted up 89 prescriptions of a psychotropic nature, the majority for kids who had left the program.

About half way through her inventory, she registered the rumble of Rusty Harrow's truck leaving the driveway. Margaret\'s brain was busy solving the conundrum of the enormous drug stash in Dr. Hazey\'s home bathroom and she no longer had time to think about how crazy Rusty Harrow was.

Dr. Hazey was writing new prescriptions for whatever drugs he wanted in the names of kids he\'d treated and those records were available in Hazey\'s office. Margaret cleaned his office every week and she knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the top right drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and anybody else who wanted to know whatever he didn't want them to know but was too lazy to hide.

She wished she hadn't taken all the bottles off the crammed shelves. Damn. What if Hazey organized his drugs in a certain order? She randomly tucked them in wherever she found space. Nothing she could do about it if Hazey figured out that she\'d spent an interesting half hour perusing his personal Pleasure Chest.

She was so shaken by the discovery of Hazey's drug stash, she forgot the damn shoe she'd been sent for. She remembered it on the way out of his gated community. The one with the sign that said Kootenai Reserve. Reserved for everybody but the Kootenai Indians, they meant.

The shoe was where she left it on the kitchen counter. Size 13 Triple EEE Brooks Brothers with a hole wearing through the sole.

On her way out, the arms of the neglected poinsettias on the dining table seemed to reach out to her. She felt a wave of guilt. Honestly, she wasn't a jealous person. She was a good employee. One who cared about the Inner Horizons kids and wanted them not to suffer.

She emptied out the kitchen teapot and gave all the plants a drink. The image of lonely Dr. Hazey eating Grape-nuts at the kitchen sink in his wingtips sucked the green envy right out of her and she even loaded all the lonely bowls in the dishwasher.

Dr. Hazey. He was crazy as a loon, she supposed, but he was her loon. Now what in creation was she going to do about it? Leverage. She needed some goddamn leverage to get Hazey to do the right thing.

Christ on a crutch.

Right in the middle of the concrete steps where Rusty Harrow had enjoyed his mid-morning snack, she stepped over an empty beer can and a coil of salami skin like a snake. Forget the rigmarole of de-arming and re-arming the security system. She threw Rusty's trash in her purse. It would serve Hazy right if beer dripped on the leather.

Three

ONE OF THE STUPID FAMILY stories Dad loved to tell was about the day he had to leave an emergency board meeting at his heart defibrillator company because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to preschool and Jamesy and the Schwarzenegger kid are having PB&J sandwiches and grape juice," Dad would say. "There's the Schwarzenegger with his arm around James, drinking out of the same glass." That night, Maria Shriver calls up and says James left a perfect bite mark on her kid's butt.

"'I told James to bite his tongue next time,'" Dad would say. "Or at least wait till after the board meeting." As if James could control his urge to strike out which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. No advance planning involved. The impulse came. He bit down.

It was only later, like the moment he stared at the crazy pattern in the safety glass of a shattered windshield, that he realized it wasn't as fun as it had promised.

"What the shit?" he cried when the new girl whose name he'd forgotten landed in his lap during Process group. Her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at the blond girl's face upside down. Her pupils were rolled up like a window shade; white and mapped with tiny red capillaries you couldn't follow.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get Bruce!" she shouted. Then, pointing at Lydia, she shouted, "Call 9-1-1!"

Half sprawled on James and half on the carpet, the girl began flopping like a carp. Everybody in Process Group perched on the edge of their seats watching her as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between thankfulness that the seizure put an end to the accountability bull shit and truly appalled at the sight of Bruce, the burly van driver, kneeling on the girl's elbows while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James laid his hands on her thin, long legs and he felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if she were being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, while James held on with all of his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying-on of hands on a person seized by electricity, impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. The girl's body had a will and an agenda all its own. He glanced at Lydia and tried to catch her eye, wondering if the bodily highjacking shook her as much as it shook him. She was plucking something out of Darlene's purse and wasn't even tuned into girl's seizure.

After a bone-jarring shiver that started at her head and rolled through the girl's body the way a dog shook off water, her eyes -- a bruise-darkened blue -- popped open. She glanced around the cluster of unfamiliar faces and James had the impression she was thinking she'd woken up in hell. Consciousness spread slowly over her face, followed by a deep blush of shame. The monster is out of the closet, James read, and it is me.

"Are you OK?" Darlene asked her. James squeezed her hand, feeling fingers thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then catching his eye, dropped his hand as if she'd been burned.

Darlene and Bruce decided to load her into the Suburban and take her in to Kootenai Hospital. It was 20 miles away but it would be faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Gretchen, the Dietician, in charge. At least Gretchen wouldn't be touching food while she was busy supervising the group they left behind. James couldn't understand how even her carrot sticks tasted weird.

By then, Process Group was officially toast.

Everybody replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Lydia, to whom everything always came around to sex, said she thought the new girl fell in James' lap because she was trying to give James a blowjob. "I thought I'd have to fight her off," she said. Reza, his motor mouth roommate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants.

"Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

"They must have known she was epileptic!" Old Girl was pissed off. "What the fuck's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than let her rip him a new asshole with her razor tongue. The girl was pretty scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. She had an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he'd was more familiar with at bottom of a tequila bottle. He surprised himself by saying, "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

Paul, the mammoth Aspbergery wizard, who never ever said a word, actually spoke. "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like a ghost was speaking.

"What are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

Everybody laughed. Paul went back to doodling equations on the back of his hand.

Lydia bumped James from behind, the sign she had to have sex right now. How could you think about sex when you were shaken to the core?

James' parents could afford to throw a brand new Mercedes off a cliff every three months which was the equivalent of his quarterly fees at Inner Horizons. Dad, CEO of Life Monitor Inc., and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, and a neurosurgeon, were both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, reminded him in his therapy session. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked. James's answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

James's Mom was always asking him why he did the shit that he did. Sometimes he even asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time" was the only answer that made any sense to him.

It didn't seem to him when he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on weed or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka from his dad's liquor cabinet\-- that he had trouble staying on task or became easily distracted.

Once in a good moment with Dr. Mom, he asked her why he and Susan, his sister, were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system figures out how to talk to your frontal cortex."

He'd looked up the limbic system. As he now understood it, the lizard brain housed all his fears and fuck-ups. The frontal cortex controlled the decision-making parts of his brain, which appeared to be stunted.

He commented when they were having pizza on the way to basketball game that his frontal cortex must be the size of a walnut." Oh, no, James," she said. "It's the right size. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to the rest of your yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections. "Time," she said, matter-of-factly. "Only time makes the brain connect." She sighed. "And good genes."

Maybe that's why Susan had a high round forehead. All those genes and connections she inherited programmed her straight A's in AP classes when he barely got into Cal State with a basketball scholarship. All Susan's neural connections made her brain bulge out and James' lack of them gave him low impulse control.

Plain and freckled Susan did exactly what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by any text or IM from his pals. Lydia's demand that he meet her for stand-up sex in the bathroom even though he was beginning to hate the sight of her was no different. Susan would say, "I have to study for my Calc test," while James Pavlovian response was always, "F3A3."

Fuck yeah, anytime, anywhere, any place.

Four

Lydia waited for James in the unheated bathroom off the living room. She was standing in a cast iron tub the size of an iceberg. Naked from the waist down, wearing thin cotton socks, It felt like she was standing on a block of ice.

In two hours---exactly one hour and 56 minutes, according to Grandpa Ben's birthday present of a Piaget watch ---Lydia's mother Rahel was coming to visit . If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart.

She'd already checked her wallet. The \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse during the new girl's epileptic fit was safely tucked away. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black nails. It would also pay for a French manicure with perfect white crescents, a service that cost \$60 bucks on New York's upper East Side and \$15 in Coeur d'Alene. The one good thing about Idaho.

If she'd known Rahel would show up in Couer D'alene, she'd never have gone Goth Girl.

Looking around at the oak veneer in the faux country bathroom---even the toilet seat was blond oak---Lydia made a note to herself to remember to stash her cheap-ass Betsey Johnson knock-off tote on Esty's side of the room.

She'd had it drilled into her by both her mother that only poor people wore fakes. People with money intuitively knew what was real. Lydia had studied in Lausanne, Switzerland, at a girl's school for four years, went to private school for three years in Grosse Point when she lived with Grandpa Ben and Adele, then during a brief fling Rahel had with a Superintendent of Public Schools, she went to NY public school in Manhattan for less than a semester. Rahel took her out of PS #19 in a NY minute the day Lydia came home with head lice. Most of high school was spent back in Switzerland at a different girl's school, where they taught her how to dress in deportment classes and she taught herself how to undress under the lacrosse bleachers with the assistant coach.

Even in authentic Jimmy Choos, Rahel would be faster than Lydia in running shoes. Her mother kept herself tiny as a ferret and she was always harping after Lydia to lose weight. If Lydia's weight went up two pounds, it was social suicide on Rahel Bronfman's scale. What man would want you if you were fat?

The first thing Lydia planned to do after Rahel took off on her Lear jet was to run downtown to Dunkin' Donuts and stuff herself with every cake donut and cream cruller on the shelf. She'd imagine her mother looking at the clouds at thirty-thousand feet while her daughter scarfed donut after donut. Then Lydia would open her mouth and vomit everything she'd swallowed into the maw of the second hand purse her mother had left behind for her birthday. That's what I think of your stinking birthday present, Mom.

Lydia wondered what in hell was keeping James. She pushed away the image of the new girl's blond ponytail thumping the hardwood. The sightless eyes rolled up white. The wild tattoo of her heels. Lydia's Godzilla itch for sex, as relentless and bad as it was, was at least on the inside of Lydia's body, hidden with all the other horrible things she kept locked up . Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside of what the world saw as a petite and perfectly maintained body. It was a small mercy that she didn't have to wear her ugliness on the outside like the epileptic's hair shirt.

She had been so hoping the new arrival at Inner Horizons would be a boy. Actually, a hella-boy with a hella-Godzilla-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed on Saturday when a tall, bleary-eyed blond named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her she could only have herbal tea!

Another of Inner Horizon's rules with no reason. It was just as impossible to answer as the question of why no boy ever wanted anything to do with Lydia outside of sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped, the smell of sex trailing after them like skunk. Were guys like James, who were clueless in most things, somehow onto her desire to make them weak? Once they got what they wanted, did they intuit that she didn't have anything else to give? What else would you give someone when you already gave them access to your body? No clue.

Yesterday after marathon monkey sex in the girl's restroom at Northern Idaho Community College where she'd started taking classes, James had muttered, "I feel dirty."

She felt like he'd slapped her. "I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's..." James thought for a long moment as if trying to order his thoughts. "You're like a Hoover. So mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels ... ah... impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

James was holding a spent condom between his thumb and forefinger like a rat corpse when in fact, the slimy thing was filled with his own sperm. "You make me feel used," he said.

That was how Lydia was feeling the longer she waited. She couldn't make up her mind whether she was jouncing harder for sex or for a confetti-covered cake donut. Both of them would go down in two minutes and but only one of them would come back up in a satisfying swirl of green and blue and pink.

That was the real reason she was locked up in Idaho. Her orthodontist in Grosse Point had ratted her out to Grandpa Ben and Gramma Elaine, telling them that the back sides of her teeth were pitted as a forty-year-old's. What a shit show. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food, but there was no fucking way she'd ever be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was always so empty. No wonder when she looked in the mirror, she was always surprised to see her reflection.

Early in Lydia's young life she had loved to look at herself in the mirror.

Her first memory was of skating down the long mirrored hall of the big house in Grosse Point calling \"Mom\'s coming. Mom\'s coming!\" Her nanny had told her that her mother was coming home from Europe. For hours Lydia skated the main hall in her bare socks. Back and forth. Back and forth.

Grandma Elaine finally told her she\'d wear out the floorboards if she didn\'t quit. What was funny about the memory is that Lydia remembered almost nothing about her mother's actual visit. A cloud of perfume, maybe. Her mother\'s low, assessing voice. \"My, you\'re not very big,\" she told her, as if that was somehow Lydia's fault.

It was the expectation of being judged that stuck. Learning that her hair was too curly or her legs too thin or her voice had too much Detroit in it. Once, Lydia heard her mother call her "the little Jew\" and when she learned later that it was the mother's blood that defined Jewishness, it didn't make sense.

It wasn't till much later, when she actually lived with her mother in New York that she learned to have no expectations. Why she had such a visceral memory of watching herself slide along the waxed floor, she had no idea. That day, it felt like she was flying with her hands out ready to catch the thing that was coming with great joy.

It was only when she got what she was expecting that she realized her hands were empty.

By the time James shoved the shower rings open, Lydia was already clawing her way up his long, thin body and scissoring her legs around his waist. She groped at his belt buckle, trying to undo it and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!" She was feeling like the top of her head was going to blow off. She couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He was just starting to kiss her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes widened and locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard.

When the door shut, a pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands.

"I can't. That new girl... I thought she was dying," James said, holding her away with stiff arms.

I'm dying, Lydia thought, feeling an unfamiliar moment of empathy for the epileptic girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. Her emptiness was unbearable enough without any flopping or jerking.

"You don't have to think! Just feel!" She hauled at his belt buckle, thinking he was kidding. "C'mon!"

"No!" James straight-armed her in torso. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" She patted at the area below his belt, looking for evidence of welcome. When she came up flat, she said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way her eyes rolled up in her head?"

Lydia's thighs were wiry and toned from years of gymnastics and ballet . She tightened them into a death grip but James, who was a foot taller and way stronger, pushed her relentlessly down past his knees like a donut.

"Don't hold out on me!" she wailed.

"I'm not. I just ..." James hesitated.

In the pause, she shot up and slapped him as hard as she could.

"What the hell?" James's cheek flushed bright red where her hand had lit his skin like a flare. "Why'd you do that!?"

"I need it!"

Now the flush looked more like a trouble light on James's cheek. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly turning me on."

"Dick head!"

" What? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

"Fucking dick!" They were both huffing like whales at the surface. Lydia felt a rising volcanic pressure in her chest that was making it hard to breathe.

James was already backing away from her. He stepped out of the tub, jangling the curtain rings like an alarm bell.

"You fucking faggot!" she cried. "You can't get it up. You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked up. The red on his cheek bones where she slapped him burned bright in blue-white skin.

"Limp dick! "Her openhanded slap snapped his head back. "Dickless wonder!" Another slap.

"You weren't calling me names an hour ago!" James was referring to the quickie she gave him before breakfast up against the back wall of the Healing House garage when they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that the raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins the night before.

That was then, this is now, she thought. "Faggot!"

James had his hand on the white, porcelain door knob and for a deranged instant, Lydia had the impression he was fondling a skull. "Why would I fuck you?" he said. "You're fucking crazy."

The bathroom door shut with the sound of clicking and bumping ice. Lydia let her body slide down in the tub until her head rested on the cold white porcelain edge while she watched the ice floe drift away from land.

FIVE

AFTER HIS WIFE, ALMA, LEFT him for a horse whisperer, Dr. August Sanders Hazey often found himself staring at the black and white photo on his office wall. The portrait from the early 20^th^ Century showed three farmers dressed up on their way to a party. He wished he could go with them.

A neat stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical insurance premiums needed to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the dour but ambitious head therapist, remained unread. Unsigned.

Dr. Hazey checked the clock again. Another hour before he could reasonably down another muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck for his session with Rahel Bronfmann nee---What? The Grosse Point heiress to the Bronfman alcohol fortune had divorced, remarried and then divorced again in the year and a half since Lydia Bronfmann came to the program. How the woman remembered her own name was a mystery.

His plan was to assure Rahel about Lydia's Bronfmann's progress, which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl, a cutter and a bulimic, had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. Lydia had four write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct. The rest of her file was stuffed with carefully coded phrases: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (i.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening (keeping her under lock-and-key worked, to a point). "Recommend single room" (can't get along with Essie Lattimer, the roommate).

What he could say definitively say about Lydia Bronfmann was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were never late.

Parents like Rahel Bronfmann nee \_\_\_? came to Dr. Hazey to be reassured. He'd tried passing off this duty to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene had a problem with brutal honesty. She had no idea how to be reassuring without outright lying. When parents met with Darlene, she of the dour and sour personality, there went another monthly check that should have gone to Inner Horizons and ended up being written to the new Anorexia Unit at McLain, associated with Harvard, or to Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu where lucky patients got to surf. God, it was a dog-eat-dog-with-anxieties-world.

Hazey had long ago mastered the trick of hitting the right balance between avuncular reassurance and avoiding the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact almost every adolescent he'd ever met toyed with sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

By the time Rahel Bronfman Fiat (soon to be ex-Fiat, Lydia said) sailed into Dr. Hazey's office, she was thirty minutes late. She waved a vaguely dismissive hand at him, simultaneously air-kissing Lydia on both cheeks. It flashed through Hazey's mind that perhaps the girl's mother missed her cheeks by an inch because she really couldn't tell if she was there.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A flutter of an eyelid communicated that Rahel hated the mop of short black curls that Lydia had stopped straightening soon after filing a formal complaint that she couldn't find a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "It's so... informal." Rahel's voice was low, with the Detroit scrubbed out of it by either good schools or a voice coach.

Her mother smiled at her daughter with her delicate nose a touch too high. From the grim expression on Lydia's face, she seemed to be thinking about shoving Rahel's false eyelashes up her cosmetically enhanced nostrils. She had two of them, didn't she? Two roads to hell, she would think.

Rahel was a petite, dark-haired woman, a perfect clone of her daughter or, Hazey supposed, vice versa. Lydia, arms crossed on the couch next to her mother, was also tiny but rounded in that childlike way while her mother was tight and lean without an ounce of softness. Hips, narrow as a teenager, with calves like slip knots above excellent chiseled ankles. Clearly, Rahel's workout routine was more military than the Marines.

Lydia's mother's first concern was whether her daughter had put on any weight. "Lyd has a tendency to fat, like I do," Mrs. Bronfmann said, patting a wiry haunch that was as flat as a Greyhound.

Though the woman *was* attractive in a feral way. When she laid a hand on Hazey's arm---he'd made the mistake of pulling his wing back chair close to her---he felt like a cream puff awaiting her sharp teeth. "I hope you're helping my little girl," she said, her voice deep and throaty with concern. "Lydia's all I have."

"Rahel," Lydia said, "Dr. Hazey isn't my therapist. That's not his area."

Rahel said, "You're not being treated by the Head of the Program? Is that what you're saying?"

"I asked for a woman therapist," Lydia said. "You know. Because we get along so well." To this enigmatic statement, she gave Rahel a bland and sugary smile.

Hooboy.

When Hazey tried to probe gently about why Rahel didn't join the weekly calls for Lydia's family therapy, she said airily, "I've been out of the country" as if phones and Skype were yet to be invented.

"Even young adults can feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their therapy," he said.

"Did she say something about me?" Rachel cried. "I'm a good mother!"

Hazey took the hint and smoothly deflected Rahel's claim, saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfmann---your father? --- is the paternal figure in Lydia's life." Clearly, the key issue between mother and daughter wasn't going to be solved in a 45-minute conversation between Lear Jet refuelings.

"It's so good you're here. Lydia was very surprised when we told her about your visit," Hazey said. This was code for Lydia's crying jag and refusal to meet with her mother until she extorted an art class at NICC out of them, though she wasn't ready for that level of freedom. "Would you two like some time to yourself? I can step out of the room."

Both Rahel and Lydia looked at Hazey like he was going to abandon them in the middle of a fire storm. "No" Lydia cried, at the same time as Rahel was standind, saying, "No, no, Dr. Hazey. I'm only here to say hello and drop off Lydia's birthday present. You know she just turned 18 this week."

"Last week," Lydia said. "Mom and I have birthdays in the same month." Lydia smiled a sugary smile when she added "Only now Mom is 17 and I'm older than she is. It's great when you can make your birthdays run backwards."

The conversation went down hill after that. Less than fifteen minutes after the start of the meeting, the clack of Rahel's departing heels jackhammering in Hazey's overloaded brain. God, he needed that muscle relaxant. He absolutely couldn't. He had to control himself. He had to stay awake for his four o'clock appointment with Old Girl.

He called Darlene and told her about the disastrous encounter with Lydia's mother., off loading the job of triage to his next-in-command. Then he laid back in his reclining chair and contemplated the young farmers on the way to their merriment. Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, the only regular patient he still saw was Old Girl. He'd had to drop all his other long-term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of the administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections?

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her. He supposed Lydia Bronfmann would be amazed. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep Old Girl on his crowded schedule though it was hell on his schedule to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include the only patient who made him laugh. Old Girl continually surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. And if he didn't get through to her, he was afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to jolt the girl out of her suicide ideation. She seemed to be responding to a new cocktail of antidepressants but suicide had been a part of her identity so long, he couldn't seem to break her death wish. It was like she'd been on the path to her own destruction for so long that the walls had built up over her head while the path she walked cut deep into granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair she could barely see the stars above her.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit heel. He was also lazy. And unproductive. And he really, really wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for a pick-me-up because he was a professional and he did care, even he mostly didn't act like it.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. He couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a healthy young woman would wear dry wooly scraps of hair like a rag bag mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with nine weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her sexuality and she buried it in unisex clothing and matted hair that looked like desiccated snakes.

Didn't she want a boy friend? Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horizons from becoming a bed hopping swap fest. But maybe he should make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way than sex with one of her peers? That boy from Malibu---Justin? Jamison? James?---he was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing a woman with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a reason for the No Fishing Off the Company Dock rules. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at NICC now that she had finished the Intensive program and was now taking community college classes . If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought.

The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the muscle relaxants.

Six

Lydia had fortified herself for her mother's visit with Seven for Mankind jeans, a Miu-Miu blouse and over-the-knee black Ferragamo boots. It was just that in her post donuts, hollowed out, state, she kept having the out-of-body experience of getting smaller until she couldn't feel her weight on the couch.

When it came out that the reason for Rahel's visit was that her mother wanted to take her out of the Program so that she could control Lydia's maintenance allowance and live on her funds until her next divorce settlement came through, Lydia was surprised that her mother put the decision on her. Rahel's carmine nails played with the gold clasp on her Blenciaga bag and Lydia had a vision of being swallowed up by the black braided leather and being turned into a bag shaped block that would be left on the luggage shelf until someone remembered to retrieve her. Leaving the Program would be great. Leaving her mother in the lurch would be even better.

"So I guess you're stuck with me," she told Dr. Hazey as her mother's heels clicked away from her like a radioactive counter.

Hazey turned his back to her. He seemed mesmerized by the only open water that remained unfrozen on Lake Couer D'Alene. The rest of the lake was a white parking lot and ice was relentlessly closing in on a flock of spinning coots that were chuckling and churning circles in the diminishing space.

"That's good. I think." He seemed to be asking a question.

"I thought you'd be happy that you weren't losing my fees," Lydia said.

"I think your mother will be more unhappy at losing your fees than I would be." The slam of the front door gave rise to an ambiguous smile.

"She'll get over it. She always does."

"Hmmm. Is that typical?" Hazey asked.

"What?"

"For your mother to walk out on you?"

"Oh that was mild. The last time I saw her, she called me a little pervert and an ingrate."

"Well, is it unusual for your mother to lose her cool?"

"That wasn't losing her cool. You should see her when she's really mad." Lydia had seen her throw a drinking glass and dislocate a man's shoulder.

"What does she do when she's really mad?"

"I didn't see her for three years from the time I was almost 15 till I was 17."

"Want to tell me about that?"

"Not particularly."

Hazey sighed. He went to the locked file cabinet behind him and rifled through the B's till he found the Bronfmann file. He paged through the bulging sheaves before he found what he was looking for. "It says here that your grandfather charged your mother for lack of supervision for a minor and maintaining an unhealthy environment." The file also said that Rahel Bronfmann's finance had been caught in bed with her daughter by Lydia's nanny.

"So she blamed you for the failure of her marriage?"

"Why do you think she called me an oversexed little ingrate?"

"So she's getting back at you by getting access to your finances?"

"She isn't too good with money, like she said."

"Actually, I think she's pretty darn good with money. She knows how to get it when she needs it."

The coots on the edge of the circle somehow managed to work their way into the inner circle so that the ones on the outside in the cold could depend on getting warm. Lydia wasn't sure how the system worked but sit seemed pretty elegant.

"Just out of curiosity, how big is your monthly allowance?" asked Dr. Hazey.

"It's not called an allowance any more. They changed it to a "maintenance allocation" when I turned 18. It's \$22,000 a month now that I'm technically an adult. Isn't all this stuff in there." She gestured to the file.

"It's news to me that you are actually saving your trust fund by being here."

Lydia blinked. "What's it cost to keep me locked up?"

"\$12,000 a month, give or take."

"What's the take?"

"If we send you to Stabilization, you can add another \$3000 to the total."

"Oh, like an annuity."

Hazey smiled. "Kind of."

After a pause, he asked, "Did you want to have sex with your mother's fiance'?"

"He was a pig. If it meant she wouldn't marry him..."

"That's a lot of responsibility to put on a 14-year-old girl."

"What do you mean?"

"Saving your mother at 14?"

"No, no. By then I was almost 15. She really couldn't see what a dick he was."

"Did you want to hurt her?"

" I was trying to help. She just didn't appreciate it so she stopped talking to me. That's when Grandpa Ben took over custodianship and I went to live in Grosse Point."

Hazey leaned toward her with his hands tented in front of his face. "Lydia, you've been at Inner Horizons more than a year now. How would you characterize your progress?"

"I've been fucked up for 18 years. You don't think you can change me in only a year and a half, do you?"

"Actually, I don't think we can change you at all. You're the only one who can do that."

Lydia went over to the window to contemplate the circling coots. She looked away and caught sight of the large gold wrapped present her mother had left behind. "Can I open my present now? Before she comes back to take it away?"

He waved her ahead and she tore into the shiny foil paper. She made swift work of the clump of silver pine coins and red berries attached to a coil of silver fabric ribbon. In an interior box , she peeled back a nest of snowy white tissue that covered a picture framed in formal gold filigree.

Lydia leaned in to peer at the image. Her stomach lurched sideways.

Lydia's mother was sitting on a yacht in Portofino harbor next to a dark haired man. The man gazed at her in adoration one hand on her thigh. Rahel was looking at the camera in the act of raising a glass of straw-colored champagne .

Lydia knew that photograph. And she knew it had been altered. The original had been taken the day before Rahel and Aldo Fiat were scheduled to get married in Church of St. George . But it wasn't Rahel who was sitting on the pristine white yacht floating on blue Mediterranean water. It had been Lydia sitting next to Aldo on the formed fiberglass bow with the sun setting behind them. Her mother had been behind the camera and she had taken the photo. Now she had somehow excised Lydia from the image as if she hadn't been there.

Aldo squeezed Lydia's adolescent knee in one hairy hand while whispering in her ear, all his attention focused on her. Lydia's 14-year-old hand raised a straw colored glass of ginger ale in the air while her mother's 40 year-old face stared back at the viewer with a knowing smile. A low hum of distress sounded in the room and it took Lydia a second to realize the sound came out of her

Dr. Hazey was watching her. "What's upsetting you about this picture?"

How to describe the happiness of that day without going into all the aftermath when Marlene, her east German nanny, walked in on Aldo thrusting like a piston into her?

"I was there," she said, pointing at the image of her mother. "That's not Rahel, that's me." She put her index finger on the picture, on the place where Aldo was stroking the inside of a thin knee under the fabric of the skirt. She felt the red indentation of those cigar scented fingers. The black hairs that lined the back of his hands which were sparser than the black hairs that coiled around his groin

Hazey's eye brows knotted with puzzlement as he tried to parse what she was saying. "You mean you were there when the picture was taken?"

"Yes. I was. I mean... no. I was sitting where she is. Mom was taking the picture and Aldo was sitting next to me with his hand on my knee." She stabbed at the large, sausage shaped fingers and looked away from Hazey.

"Mom had the photo retouched to get rid of me."

She had always liked Aldo. He was fun and funny, always joking around with the yacht boys and the masseuse and masseur and telling them all dirty jokes that were too old for her in his Italian-accented English. It bewildered he when she woke up to him lying on top of her, kissing her breasts and forcing her legs apart with his knee. She screamed when he started poking at her. It hurt like fire and it felt like he was both suffocating her with his weight and splitting her in two and it was the noises she made to defend herself, even as Aldo pressed one hairy hand over her mouth and hissed at her to take what he she'd been begging for, that woke up Marlene, the nanny, asleep in the next room.

"That's my leg, can't you tell? Look how skinny it is."

Hazey leaned closer and she heard his intake of breath when he saw the adolescent thigh.

"Why would your mother give this to you for your birthday?"

Therapists! Sometimes you had to do all the work because they were just too damn stupid to see what was right in their face.

Lydia shrugged. "Now you can't even tell I was with them."

The raised glass of pale bubbles. Aldo's laughing eyes. The delirious regard for the woman who's skirt he was pushing his hand under. Oh, to have never existed on that day the way her mother wanted.

"Your mother is a sick woman," Hazey said. "I hope you see that."

"She may be sick but I'm the one who's missing."

"You're here now," he said. "You don't ever have to be in that position again."

Lydia was already closing up the white nest of tissue in order to cover up the image.

"You're right," she said. "I doubt my Grandfather will ever let me live with her again."

"What about you, Lydia. Do you want to live with your mother?"

She turned hopeless eyes toward the churning birds that were spinning in the hole that was growing smaller by the freezing, flake-filled minute.. "Not today. But most days. Crazy, huh?"

"Understandable," Hazey said. "I''m not surprised."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

Lydia finally asked the one question she'd been wanting to ask for years. "Dr. Hazey, is she crazy or am I?"

"Yes," he said.

"Damn. I was afraid of that."

Her last question was one she'd thought about off-and-on for years, whenever she decided she was making progress in therapy and felt briefly optimistic. "Could you fix her if you worked with her?"

"You mean, if your mother was my patient? If I worked with her in therapy?"

"I know it's never going to happen.... But\--?"

"I don't fix people, Lydia. No therapist does."

"Well, what good are you?"

Dr. Hazey's expression was sober, as if he were thinking about the fucked up relationship between mother and daughter and unhappy with his conclusion.

"I didn't say therapy wasn't helpful. All I said was that change is up to the individual."

"So you must work with a lot of patients who can't change. Doesn't that make you feel like a failure?"

He rolled his eyes. "Out of the mouths of babes," he muttered, under his breath.

He ended by saying that he would bring Darlene up to speed on Rahel's visit this afternoon. "No doubt you'll be revisiting this conversation for some time."

For no reason, one of Aldo's hoary old jokes came back to her like a ghost. "Dr. Hazey, do you happen to know the definition of eternity?"

"Can't say I do."

"Two people, a ham and their relationship with their mother."

OLD GIRL WAS PISSED that they'd moved Rachel's stuff into her room.

They brought the girl back from her trip to the Emergency Room right before Med Check. Old Girl made a point of looking absorbed in reading *Stranger in a Strange Land* in case the new girl wanted to get chatty. Rachel unpacked two huge suitcases while Old Girl wondered if she'd think it was weird that her side of the room looked like no one lived there. The shared closet was almost bare with the exception of one jacket and some tee shirts she didn't want.

Rachel laid out a quilt and two matching pillows along with sheets that she'd brought from home. It was a crazy quilt of velvet and polka dots and purple and orange spangled fabric that somehow all worked together though none of it matched. A photo of herself with a girl who looked like a sister and two adults on a beach in Mexico, all wearing stupid sombreros, went on the bed side table. Next came a photo of the same adults in a Range Rover parked near a herd of zebras.

By the time she finished unpacking, she was out of hangers. Then the bell for 8:00 Med Check rang.

Old Girl showed her where the Drug Room was off the kitchen. The beefy nurse, Gloria, was counting out pills into multiple rows of plastic cups. Gretchen, the dietician, was counting out pills and checking the contents of the little cups against a clipboard.

"Did the Emergency Room check you out?" Gloria asked Rachel. Rachel rolled her eyes and said that the podunk Emergency Room of the podunk Kootenai Hospital gave her the standard podunk medical response: "Epilepsy? You're on Depakote?" A Sikh doctor in turban and clogs peered under her eyelids and told her she was good to go.

Old Girl had gotten good at reading upside down in the early stages of her psychiatric education. Gretchen prepped a pill cup for Rachel that held almost as many pills as Old Girl's what with her epilepsy drugs plus anti-anxiety this, anti-depressant-that. Our cups overfloweth, she thought, reading the long list of meds on Rachel Cathcart's chart.

"Who's Angela Livengood?" Rachel turned to Old Girl with a perplexed look. "I haven't met her yet."

Old Girl arched an eyebrow. "You don't want to. She's a bitch."

Rachel said Inner Horizons seemed to have a lot of bitches. One had already rifled her suitcase and stolen her new, never-worn Lulu Lemon pants before she even had a chance to unpack. "What's so bad about Angela?"

Old Girl held a gingery dread lock in front of her eyes, making her look both demented and purposeful. "For one thing, she'll rip your ears off if you call her Angela."

"Why?"

"It pisses her off. It's a stupid name."

"It's not. It's just old fashioned," said Rachel, scrutinizing all the Healing Housers who were forming up in a straggling line for their daily cocktail of drugs. "What does she look like?"

"Like me."

Old Girl tightened the scrunchy that collected her dreads in a spray of ginger-brown stalks. She was trying for a fountain of cattails on the top of her head.

"I haven't seen anybody else with dreads here. Who's she rooming with?"

Old Girl yawned. "You."

"You're up, Oldster," Gretchen called out and 0ld Girl obediently took the little glass of water held out to her. She threw back a dozen or so pills in a practiced swallow. Then Old Girl opened up her mouth and let Gretchen swab around her mouth, under her tongue, between her cheek and her gums. She leaned backwards to let Gretchen peer, like a spelunker, into the cave of her mouth.

"How's it going with Abilify?" Gretchen asked. "It's the end of week three."

Old Girl raised one shoulder to her ear, like the hunchback of Notre Dame, and she dragged one leg in a halting step toward the door. "I'm cured! Am I good to go?"

Rachel waggled her fingers good-bye to Old Girl, Tweety-Bird style. She called after her. "That Angela bitch could be wrong. I'm taking Ability and it got better for me."

"As long as you don't call her Angela," Old Girl said, "That's all the better it's going to get."

EIGHT

SATURDAY WAS OUTDOOR ACTIVITY DAY. People were trying to find their snow gear. Old Girl, waiting at the front door, ski-hatted, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy blue down, feIt like a preschooler. Where was the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and over her neck?

They were supposed to leave at eleven but by the time everybody found all their gear, it would be closer to noon. It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door at the house she grew up in in Portland while Mom wrestled Gabe into his snowsuit. She was five years older, so she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding his compact square body between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down to get his foot corked into a green boot. Old Girl half-imagined a pop when the foot finally slipped in. Did it bloop? Or was it more like a thwock? The reverse of a champagne cork, she thought.

What was Gabe doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the sun-dappled Before of her life, and came up blank. Gabe was a smiling dark-haired baby -- not the colicky screamer she had been, according to Aunt Peggy. Her mind was empty as an ice-covered lake.

Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. He was a builder and she used to be able to call him up by smelling fresh-cut wood. Now, when she carried kindling and split logs for Healing House's wood stove, all she smelled was pitch. Dad was gone, escaped up the chimney. He was even farther away than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a senior citizen had driven a Cadillac up on the sidewalk and crushed all three of them.

The sky was its usual color of cement. The van hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how the Idahoans said it). A French name from some ancient trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just eleven kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the blizzards.

Barely five miles out of town, James and Lydia got a warning for inappropriate touching and they were separated. Now James sat next to the driver in the front, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Lydia's crotch and Rachel Interlachen slumped against the window next to him. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but she'd checked out okay at the hospital after her fit. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Lydia in the far back of the Suburban AKA Barfland.

Barfland felt glacial. Luckily, Lydia was in a pout so Old Girl didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Lydia had traded oral sex for candy in the past week. Blowjobs. Just another word for Idaho money, Lydia had told her last week.

Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House. Endless blue trees. A landscape where nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About three miles was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature dropped.

Josh told them the plan was to make them snowshoe up to Surprise Lake. It fed into the main lake. The hike was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head back to the van.

The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt like she was always being assaulted. After Peggy and David drove off, the first thing she understood had been taken away was a quiet place to hear herself think. For the millionth time, Old Girl missed her iPod, which had been confiscated the day she came into the Program. Some asshole had broken into the storage locker where contraband was kept---probably Reza, the klepto---and now it was permanently lost.

Old Girl had dark plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

THE TRAIL TO TWO MOUTH Lake climbed gently for a mile. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of this hellhole, he wanted to be in shape to play basketball at Pepperdine. Would the move back home to Malibu be like going from one circle of hell to the next? He'd been working his way through *The Inferno* from the rag-tag library at Healing House, not that he'd ever let on to his parents. They'd long since given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but World of Warcraft.

As they zigzagged up a trail, James caught views of the upper peaks. Gray-white in the near-distance, white-blue in the distance, until the vastness stretched diamond white to the sky. A stutter flight of a bird shocked out of a bush by their noise. It winged away in flight with tight claps of its feathers to its body in a syncopated stroke-stroke-stroke and gllllliiiiiiddde.

The chitchat quieted down once the trail steepened. Lydia lagged at the back of the line. She was still in a snit about how James had wrestled her hand away from his crotch in the van, which was how Josh caught them. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight! The fucktard. Was he a piece of meat? He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Lydia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the women's bathroom at NICC where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (Progress! His mother enthused on their weekly conference call.)

He wished there was an Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Lydia was motivated by the danger rather than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for love, he told himself. It would be nice just to be liked.

The new girl, Rachel, tramped steadily behind him. She was keeping up with him and they were way ahead of the pack so he assumed she was in pretty good shape. He'd heard she was a dancer. Old Girl, who was dogging their heels, was also in shape but she didn't count because she spent hours on the treadmill every day. James always had to hand over his allowance so she'd let him have a forty-five minute run. Five bucks for a weekly allowance! What kind of trouble could you get in with that? James remembered the day he turned eight and Dad handed him \$50 for his first allowance. The look on Mom's face when she found all the licorice he hid under his bed.

Giant snow-heavy Ponderosa pines pinched off light on the trail. It felt claustrophobic. A whumph of snow dropped from a branch in a blinding plume that made him jump.

James was always shivering in Idaho. When you grew up in Malibu, shorts and flip-flops were all you wore to armor yourself against the day. Idaho required a full body suit of flannel and wool and two-inches of down. Sometimes it felt so thick, he wasn't even sure he was in there. The day of the hike, though, he was sweating. He threw off layers of down and wool and polyester that smelled rank and disgusting. He'd expected a sense of freedom or at least largeness when Mom and Dad told him they were sending him to the Idaho wilderness "to grow up." Instead, he felt small and inconsequential, a mere speck in thousands of miles of trees and mountains and ice that went on forever. If you fell down, no one would ever find you.

"Slow down!" somebody in the back yelled. Rachel stepped on the back of James' snowshoe and he almost fell over. "Sorry!" she said. James knelt to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the straps. "It's okay, I was dreaming."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone sounded tentative, like she was worried about breaking Inner Horizon's endless rules. They'd gotten the mandatory stay-together lecture at the trailhead. James had heard it about 50 times, even at the bowling alley.

Old Girl stepped out of the trail and skirted around them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "Don't sweat it," he said to Rachel, "It's OK as long as the three of us hang together."

He tramped steadily upward, glad to work on his endurance. The stillness was disconcerting. No foot tracks. A soft skitter of some four-footed creature's footpads. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone, who lived at the end of their street. What he'd really like to see is a wolf though he'd settle for an elk. Something majestic. If he saw an elk, he'd have something he could talk about on the weekly family torment call.

James parents were always asking him why he did the stupid shit he was always doing. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time" was the only answer that made sense to him.

He didn't seem to be able to think long term. He never thought about the consequences. Generally, he was thinking, "Hey, this'll be rad!" Or "Whooee!" It was later, as when he was hanging upside down and staring at the crazy pattern in his shattered windshield, that he wondered if the fun was ever worth it.

If that was the life lesson he was fated to repeat forever, how could he bear it?

His parents should just give it up and accept that James was a fuck-up and a loser. Not everybody could be like his sister, Susan, with A's on her Princeton report card, which occupied a week of agonizing dinnertime harangues while James hoped his report card had gotten lost on the way to Siberia. He checked the mail faithfully but once he started coming home drunk and stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks? A shit load, apparently.

RACHEL HEARD THE BOOMING BEFORE she saw it. A tinkling sound like breaking glass. Thrashing and crashing, accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl raced ahead of her down the blue-shadowed trail that descended to a lake, followed by James who put on speed like a sprinter. A thunderous crack. Then came an odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Rachel had ever heard.

By the time she got to the lake, the moose was already tiring. Rachel could see cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged dark pool a hundred yards from the lakeshore. A moose floundered in roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. The moose would lunge part way up, heaving its massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break off with its weight. Every time it managed to get up, another ledge of ice would shear off. The black water was dotted with snow clumps that shuddered and bobbed while the creature fell back again and started swimming in circles.

"Holy shit!" James' voice was awestruck.

"What can we do?" Old Girl's usually deadpan voice broke high and squeaky. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight of the struggling moose, she registered the fracture of Old Girl's careful facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind as the moose made another attempt to throw itself forward. It had huge antlers and rolling eyes that started in terror as it fell backwards.

"Get a stick!" Old Girl clawed at a clump of downed alder trapped in the ice at the shore. She got both hands on a branch and started jumping on it to try to break it out of the ice.

"What good is that? What's it going to hold on with?" James cried.

"Maybe we can get a branch under it. Lever it up somehow." Old Girl beckoned to Rachel and Rachel started jumping with her until the branch splintered and broke.

Rachel and Old Girl were holding the ice-laden branch in their bare hands when the elk made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back into heaving water chocked with floating ice. As they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its shoulders and withers sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of its antlers lit by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above the blue-black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly under, the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-clotted hole.

My God, Rachel thought. Oh my God.

By the time the rest of the group joined them on the shoreline, the water had stopped spinning and the ice blocks barely shivered. Josh pointed to the jagged hole in the ice and said, "Looks like something fell through. Got any guesses what?"

Rachel opened her mouth to tell them about the moose but Old Girl instantly stepped sideways, and nearly knocked her off her snowshoes. What the\--?

James was busy inspecting a clump of withered aspen saplings as if they had some kind of blight.

"Jesus, watch where you're going." Rachel yanked her snowshoe out from under Old Girl's netting and kept her mouth shut, as Old Girl intended.

Reza said a grizzly fell in. "Look. You can see its claw marks."

James said, "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else saw the cloven tracks and thought a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, Godzilla and Dr. Hazey, the head of Inner Horizons. "He forgot to look where he was going," said Danny.

A gust of wind and a drift of snowflakes ended the nature lesson. Josh said they had to turn back to the trailhead before the snow got serious.

When James turned away from the shoreline and took up a position right behind her on the trail, as if he wanted to watch over her, Rachel's heart gave a tiny lurch. She remembered James squeezing her hand during her seizure. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Or was there a God and the black pants she always wore like a uniform had saved her like she hoped?

ELEVEN

OLD GIRL WANTED A RAZOR in the worst way. If she had a razor, it would only take a second.

Her new roommate, Rachel, was on her quilt-covered bed, shuffling through a make-up bag. "Damn. I forgot my toenail clippers. Can I borrow yours?" she asked.

Old Girl snorted. "They took those away from me when I got here."

"How do you clip your nails?"

"I don't. They just grow under my feet. They're so long now, I don't need shoes."

Rachel actually laughed at the hoary joke. "If I'd known they'd give me a comedian for a roommate, I wouldn't have made such a stink about coming here."

Old Girl felt the uneasy tug of friendship but she dismissed it as something she couldn't afford. Too bad she wasn't going to be around long enough to tell all her suicide jokes. Not that many people appreciated them.

"Yippee! I didn't forget!" Rachel waved a wicked pair of clippers at her.

Old Girl was amazed. "Didn't they go through your stuff when you got here? That's contraband."

"Toenail cutters?"

"You don't cut your nails and make them bleed? Like every other girl here?"

Rachel shrugged. "Guess I'm just not that creative. Not like you."

"Me?"

"You're always saying something clever. What else would you call yourself?"

Truthful was the word that flashed through Old Girl's brain. Truthful. Not clever. Not funny. "Your standards are pretty low."

Old Girl felt sorry when she caught Rachel's wince. For the millionth time, she regretted her ability to unerringly identify a soft spot and poke it.

Lydia passed the door of their room and flashed them a shit-eating grin. She'd been hogging the bathroom as usual. "Lights out in three minutes," she called. She grinned like the cat that ate the canary and the coke stash too.

"Bitch" Both girls spoke at the same time. Then they laughed.

On the way to the shower room, Old Girl had a flash of inspiration. Cutting nails to the quick wasn't the only thing clippers were good for. "Mind if I borrow your clippers?"

Rachel hesitated.

"I don't have HIV."

"It's not that. It's ..." Rachel leaned one hip against the sink, clenching her fingers like she was trying to grab at something elusive. "I don't know you well enough to watch you hurt yourself."

"I don't know you well enough to off myself in front of you."

Rachel handed over the clippers without another word.

She went about her face washing routine, which looked like it required a rocket science degree to get through all the steps, unlike the splash-and-dash method that Old Girl used.

When Rachel finally toweled off her face, Old Girl made a show of holding up the clippers so Rachel could see her drop them back in her make-up bag. "See. No harm, no foul."

\#

It wasn't until Rachel walked by the Baby Changing Station that she saw Old Girl's handiwork. Old Girl had used the nail clippers to scrape off the "c" in the type so it read, "Baby Hanging Station."

Thank God I got the roommate with a sense of humor, Rachel thought. This place would be hell with someone who was really depressed.

TWELVE

YOU LEAKED OUT FEELINGS AND pain at your peril at Inner Horizons. Her first therapist, who\'d left the program in three months because she hated Crazy Hazey and needed to make a living wage, had been unrelenting in her quest to get Old Girl to \"open up.\" You\'re only hurting yourself, Rosa liked to say.

"No woman no cry," Old Girl answered.

Rosa laughed when Old Girl rolled her eyes at her clichés. Then she spun out a laundry list of homilies for fun. \"The truth will set you free.\" \"Open your heart and let me in.\" \"Honesty is the best policy.\" "The heart is a lonely hunter."

Bull shit. If you got close to anybody at the Program, they either ratted you out or they left. Rosa, whom she\'d secretly admired, had escaped to Seattle, hadn\'t she? Now Old Girl was stuck with Dr. Hazey for a therapist.

Her new roommate huddled in her bed with the blankets over her head, pretending to sleep. Every few minutes a hand would snake out from the sheets and she'd grope around on the bedside table for more Kleenex. So far, Old Girl counted four Kleenex forays.

Finally she addressed the lump under the covers. "If you keep that up, you\'re going to be buried in snot rags."

A long pause. After which Rachel emerged from the blankets, setting off a cascade of Kleenex balls, and yanked on the lamp. Old Girl had been writing a list of stuff she needed to take with her., her page lit by the headlamp she wore like a spelunker. She scribbled a reminder to be sure to take it with her.

Rachel, pretending to be nonchalant, was busy rooting around in the sheets for the Kleenex blobs and dumping them one by one in the shared Hello Kitty garbage can. Old Girl wasn't taking that.

\"Rough day?\" Old Girl asked. \"Or are you saving your boogers?\"

Rachel turned a sad sack corner of her lip down. \"You must be used to it by now.\"

\"Used to baring your soul and letting people eat it like potato chips?" Old Girl inspected the unraveling end of her longest dreadlock, crossing her eyes to focus on the disappearing rat. \"You sort of get used to it.\"

\"Are you?"

"What?"

"Used to it?\" Oh fuck. Not a good time to reach out and touch someone, she thought to herself. She faux-casually switched off her headlamp, hoping that Rachel would get the message that their nascent slumber party was over before it started.

\"Reach out and touch someone," Rachel said. "Is that a song?\"

\"No, some ad campaign. My mom used to sing the jingle.\"

\"My mom died when I was born," Rachel said.

Oh double fuck and fuck a duck. Now what? There was no way Old Girl was going to share with Rachel that she lost her mom too. Why seem like she wanted to be friends when she didn't? Instead, she said, "I killed mine."

\"What? With your jokes?\"

Old Girl bit back a laugh. "You're quick,\" she said. "Smart ass."

The two girls, one red eyed and sniffling, the other closed up like a clam, sized each other up.

Then Old Girl surprised herself by saying, "My mother really is dead." Old Girl wondered if she'd been taken over by a zombie who'd had taken up control of her stony heart. Her words sailed out from her dark and dreary corner like the light that was now shining on Rachel\'s face.

"Mine isn't. I just wish she was." She pass Old Girl a picture of two white people beaming on either side of a tall black girl in a graduation cap. "That's her and my dad. I'm adopted."

Old Girl\'s heart flexed the least little bit in Rachel\'s direction. It was a rare experience at Healing House when someone surprised her.

\"What do you think of James?\" Rachel asked.

\"He\'s OK. Kind of a jock boy. \"Can you trust him?\"

"I can trust him to hog the treadmill." Whoo boy. This was not a question Old Girl could answer without consuming a piece of her own liver. \"Trust him with what? Your virginity?\"

Rachel laughed. \"No, stupid. He seems nice.\"

Everybody seemed nice until you told them something you cared about and then they used it in Process Group to make you eat your own shit.

Has he been here long? Rachel wanted to know.

"I don't know. Six months? Seven? He came here from wilderness camp, someplace in Bumfuck, Utah.\"

\"Bumfuck, Utah, to Bumfuck, Idaho. Good progress."

\"It\'s not Idaho. It\'s You-Da-Hoe,\" Old Girl said.

\"Udahoe?\"

Same mistake she had made, putting the emphasis on the You. "You-Da-HO if you fuck around with James. Big demerits for fishing off Inner Horizons' dock."

"What do they care?"

"Hell if I know. STD's? Chlamydia? It's hell on the sheets if somebody has crabs because they breed faster than lice."

She could see Rachel thinking for a minute. The girl seemed comfortable with silence, something that made Old Girl warm to her. Everybody in the Program talked non-stop about their problems and after few days, all you wanted was to make them shut up so you could hear the wind in the trees.

\"Why do you want to know about James?\" Old Girl asked.

\"Is he dating Lydia?\"

Old Girl snorted. \"If blow jobs are your idea of dating.\"

Rachel tilted her head in the manner of Rodney Dangerfield, Aunt Peggy's uber-smart border collie. Rodney was the smarter than most of the people at the Program. You could talk to him and you\'d swear, when he tilted his head in that intelligent way that he was about to answer.

\"She\'s a sex fiend. No personal boundaries. She'll fuck anything that walks. Well, except for Dr. Hazey and nobody knows if he can get it up.\"

Rachel nodded like she wasn't surprised. \"Hazey\'s kind of smarmy. He said he thought I just needed some self-actualization.\"

Self-actualization. That\'s what Dr. Hazey sold to anxious parents while refusing to let his charges develop a self without being locked up or drugged.

\"Is Hazey a stoner? Rachel wanted to know. "He did my intake session and he was slurring his words.\"

\"Everybody\'s a stoner around here if they've got any money. Why not Hazey?\"

\"You\'re full of questions,\" Rachel said, wagging a finger at Old Girl.

\"That\'s because I don\'t have any answers." She dropped her headlamp in her backpack next to her bed and gestured to the beside lamp. "Do you mind?"

In the darkness, Old Girl went to sleep wondering what Rachel would think tomorrow when she woke up to an empty room.

Lydia kept a rigid balance sheet and by nine pm, it was time to see what it added up to in her moral accounting. She went over today's score while flossing and brushing her teeth at the sink in the room she shared with Essie .

1.  1\) Stealing \$20 from Darlene's purse.

2.  2\) Slapping the shit out of James for refusing to have sex.

3.  3\) Crying like a baby during her mother's visit, then telling Dr. Hazey to fuck off for defending her.

4.  4\) Joining in on the Essie torment with psychopath Danny and sycophant Reza, both of whom made her want to puke, then taunting Essie until she lost it and got sent to Stable for stabbing Reza in the hand with a fork.

5.  5\) Palming Essie\'s dinner brownie and cramming it down her throat, then puking it up in Margaret's office, and leaving it to ferment in the trash can so Margaret would be gassed out of her office in the morning.

If she had been just middling bad, like usual, say she had laughed at James's flat feet or poked fun at Big Paul for failing to lose weight or talked trash about the new girl's freaky fit in her hearing\--she would have made herself sleep without a pillow. If her behavior was worse, like she'd ratted on someone for sneaking cigarettes (Maida) or shamed them enough to make them cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose, wiped up grape juice with a favorite cashmere sweater (Danny), she would have stripped the bed and made herself lie all night on a bare stained mattress without a blanket.

It wasn't until she heard Charlene report at dinner that Idaho storm winds were gusting and the wind chill factor was five degrees below zero that her inner judge declared a trifecta. Bare floor. Open window. Nude.

Stripped down to camisole and bikini pants, she ran through her usual skin care routine, removing her make up and lathering French eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, exfoliating the dead cells from her face with a salt scrub, closing her pores with an astringent that smelled like sulfur and vinegar from the Dead Sea, thinking about how when the cat played with the mouse too long, it was time for atonement.

At nine PM, she cracked the window open as far as it would go and by nine-thirty, frost had already started to crystalize the inside of the pane with ice diamonds. Her bare feet felt the wind stealing across the floor and a prickle of skin on the back of her neck rose in anticipation of full body goose bumps.

She dropped her underpants and knelt at the side of the bed like a cloister penitent. Then she lay on her right side where she could see the drift of slowly swirling snow flakes chase the heat away from the room. You made your bed, now lie in it, she told herself.

It was dim and silent. A silver glow from the waning moon reflected off the snow covered fields that led to the Kootenai River and the pulp mill next to the train tracks that skirted Coeur D'Alene.

Healing House settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans. She forced herself to keep her eyes open so she could watch the slow progress of the moon creep up the far wall and crawl across the ceiling with a swath of glacial blue light. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.

A whisper of frigid breeze brought up chill bumps up on her legs and arms. Quiet, she ordered herself to stop trembling.

You did this.

You're disgusting.

You're not even here.

Fourteen

BY 10 PM, OLD GIRL HAD cleaned up her side of the room and liberated some wire hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there were an exit survey with suggestions for improvement, Old Girl would have written, "If you want people to hang up their clothes, give them enough hangers."

"Fire the cook" would be first on the list.

To write a note or not? The problem was she couldn't think of anything to say. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Iowans, had tried everything on her behalf. SSRIs, psychotherapy, cognitive behavior drills, prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies). Once, in desperation, they took her to a New Age regression quack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her up like he was going to ship her back to Iran: all in the spirit of making her "better."

Old Girl knew in her heart that there was no better and why make her aunt and uncle pay when worse was what she'd come to accept? She doubted whether \'You did your best" would bring solace to two nice people who, but for fate and a senior citizen with early Alzheimer's, would still be taking two vacations a year instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Old Girl's treatment. Her parents' life insurance policy had been reasonable but after three years of treatment, it didn't take a math wizard to figure the money was running out.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter. "

"Me, too." A pause. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Trina who was bi-polar and OCD and who knew what else. Rachel hadn't said much since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding any.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Old Girl's writing wasn't going well. "You keep sighing." Old Girl didn't know she'd even made a noise. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. Old Girl has a stash of pills hidden in the closet. That had cost her a trip to Stabilization. "You can only say 'it snowed' so many times," she said.

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote," It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

"See, you are smart."

"Am not!"

"I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group."

Old Girl couldn't remember saying anything in Process Group; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down in silence while emotional shit storms flew around the house like shrapnel.

"What'd I say?"

"Lydia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Lydia always brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring. Had Old Girl meant it? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A McDonald's job wasn't going to pay for tuition or books. She wasn't planning to make prostitution a habit; she\'d just do it until she could save enough for rent. Then she could get by with stripping. She didn't have big boobs but she had a nice ass, if the boys here were any judges.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form.

She'd saved up six Benadryls from several bee stings and the pills were ready to dissolve in the Night Mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two AM, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket was a hundred dollars she'd managed to save by working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had gone to sleep so she was startled when she heard her say, "Did I look horrible when I seized?"

Old Girl turned her chair around, in order to face Rachel lying curled on one side with her covers pulled up to her chin. "Like a ling cod." She paused. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel's bell-like laugh proved to Old Girl once again, that whenever she told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, Charlene's corduroys could be heard wearing themselves out between her thighs. Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka. Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed down the hall, telling everybody it was time to hit the hay.

"I'm just going to take a last pee," 0ld Girl called to Charlene. She closed the bathroom door from the outside, making sure Charlene didn't catch her exiting the hall. Charlene's cocoa was in the living room next to a Self Magazine open to a makeover page. Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight.

The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked unbearably sad. Old Girl wished she'd been nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the weeping cream.

AT TWO AM, CHARLENE WAS SNORING on the couch, her mammoth chest rising and falling. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. We're all on our own, she told the diamond splash of stars that lit up the driveway. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted, as if the stars were shedding light.

Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked, her boots creaking. The temperature had dropped. She had been in Idaho long enough, she realized, that she had learned to speak snow. Like the sight of Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to cry.

Her plan was to walk two miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by somebody heading south. At I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with a trucker.

If she gets lucky, maybe she can sleep in the cab unless the driver wants company. Old Girl has Travis Tritt and George Jones and Willie Nelson CDs in her backpack. T-Bone Pickens, a blues growler makes her feel like somebody in the delta has lived her pain. It's all in the front pocket of her Hello Kitty backpack to offer up like trucker candy. The backpack was a Christmas present from her mom when she was ten, and it\'s too small for her now but she can\'t bear to give it up. The kitty is half worn off and Margaret has been bugging her for weeks to let her soak it in Spray-n-Wash. It used to be pink and purple and now it\'s gray, old, tattered, and frayed at the edges \-- she had to sew up a corner recently where her pens wore a hole in it. The more tattered it gets, the more she likes it. By the time she offs herself, she hopes Hello Kitty will be completely erased.

Inside the pack is a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt. A blue grass band named Mighty Squirrel. Only in Idaho. Better than sex, she plans to say. She hopes she gets the rare trucker who thinks so.

She walks for what seems like forever. Near the bottom of a slope---she hadn't realized the road was so hilly from a car ---she hears a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct is to get off the road and stand unseen among the cedar and spruce trees that reach long fingered branches to the stars. She's thinking about the moose at Two Mouth Lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to save itself. That was too painful to remember. Old Girl is seeing the moment the moose surrenders. The calm that steals over its dark eyes. The way the sun fights its way through the clouds and flames the antler tines with its sharp rays.

She imagines the moose sinking down through a column of blue to the darkness. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held regally toward the thinning light.

It would be breathtaking, floating legs and a radiant, glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. A wedding ring. A child's plastic boot. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial blue beast, like the jewels of the floating realm.

Engine noise thrums closer. In the depression in the roadway, at the bottom of the hill, it will be impossible to see a dark object on the ground until it is too late. A realization she feels like she's been moving towards her entire life. She will think more about the run details tomorrow. Maybe plan out the route better. Or take a look at a map in the library.

For the moment, she'll just lie still where the moonlight doesn't reach and stretch out. She scuttles into the center of the the roadway on all fours, hoping whoever is in the car isn't riding the brake. Lying on her side, she lays her cheek down ands let the ice crystals cut into her skin. She faces the high beams. And waits for the waters to close over her head.

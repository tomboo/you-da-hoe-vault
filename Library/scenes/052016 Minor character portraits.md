052016 Minor character portraits

Bruce, the therapist on duty, had pale blue eyes, a round smiling face and the body of a lumpy snow man. His feet were precisely square, like bricks, and James wondered how the hell he was able to buy shoes.

Darlene had been assigned as Lydia's therapist after Rosa left for a job in Seattle. Rosa had been petite with dark, serious eyes. In contrast, Darlene was big-boned and horsey with large, flat feet. Her seriously squared off haircut made her look like she was middle-aged although she told Lydia she had just turned 36. She was a single mother which would make anyone serious about staying employed, she told Lydia during her first session. Lydia took the comment to mean, "Don't get me fired."

Gretchen, who was measuring out applesauce to substitute for butter in the brownies, had thin pursed lips that were only slightly larger than the thin lines she drew on her forehead every morning. Deep brackets from nose to mouth framed a permanently disappointed face. If you saw her from the back, she looked almost adolescent, straight as a stick, no hips, possibly anorexic. When she turned around and you saw her embittered face, she looked like life had ground away all her softness.

Bruce had started at the Program the year Hazey founded it. The way he talked, the beginnings of Inner Horizon were little different than the beginning of time when all was chaos. Bruce was kind---all the kids liked him---and Margaret liked him too, except for his unfortunate conviction that Dr. Hazey was a genius.

Josh (James POV)

Josh was a tall, rangy man with light hazel eyes that stood out in his dark, egg plant-colored face. He'd been raised---in his words, "hatched"---in Baltimore somewhere deep in the projects. He thought living in Idaho was like living in Mayberry and the habits of the locals hilarious. Gun racks in every pickup, John Birch Society bumper stickers, deer antlers for hood ornaments, the drug store that dispensed live bait dispenser from a retro-fitted soda pop machine. You put your money in and a packet of wriggling night crawlers or meal bugs or maggots would drop into a tray and then you had to feel around and pull them out.

It had never occurred to James that being the only black man in town bothered Josh until the day Josh had to leave session early in time to pick up his wife's birth control prescription at the pharmacy before it closed. "I wouldn't want any kid of mine to be the only black kid in town," he said. By that James intuited that Josh felt strong enough to ignore all the people whose heads flipped backwards when they saw a black man walk past in all-white Idaho but he didn't want his children to walk the same gauntlet.

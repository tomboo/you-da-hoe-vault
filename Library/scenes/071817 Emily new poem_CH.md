**Poem 1**

You empty her sea-salt ashes,

shaking the mortuary's plastic bag

at shoreline on a pebble beach.

Low tide. Calm inlet.

Families on a grassy knoll

at the end of the cove.

The ashes form a surface cloud,

a milky coffee spill,

washing in, washing out,

no swell to carry them away.

We throw cut flowers---roses,

dyed-blue carnations, lilies---

they stay shore bound, too.

Some ashes lie where they fell,

white sand to anyone who wanders

down the beach to gather stones.

We chat about your sister's first art show,

A niece's job in a dental office,

Ash flours the sea.... (this is where i think you can go on to make a turn that refers to the loss or the person. it needs some reference to the person who is gone but remains which is how i am reading the metaphor of the ashes that remain.

**Poem** **2**

All this time I thought I needed resin

and putty knife to fix myself,

not cantors and canticles and curses

and cake makeup and white gloves

and low hemlines and shorn hair

and parsnip and a carp grinder,

and a willingness to be who I am not

This is an urgent matter my make belief.

Life threatening. Why else would I assume

an identity not my own, and kvetch?

I want to be a graying butch

with garden mud under my fingernails

I want to not know 24 hours a day who I am.

I want to sit by a river tattooed by horse flies

And write poems about lupine and volcanic ash

and give up pretense and profess

I don't know why

I like to misrepresent myself.

**Poem 3: Rain on Snow**

It's raining so much the pathway is a bog,

sundew-less. Double-time rain, triple.

I get the words down before they seep,

before they latch and form a trickle

to find a better way. Without this race

merely an abyss where sparks

have not yet been embroidered.

I can't reclaim something

if it has not been taken away.

If I destroy the knowledge I had

how do we match (find?) the shreds?

If I turn all the questions into statements will I know?

I will know.

Then my water purification plant malfunctions.

Thank God I am in a perpetual state of emergency.

I call the snow plowman's number\--

the ice-packed, watery stuff the same price as the powdery.

Pickup trucks with plows bolted to their fronts

look like boats with hulls.

Shouldn't they be dry docked?

Rain rots yet is pure---transparent, round,

slippery, refusing to stay in one place

and yet it roots beneath the welcome of wood pith

and pulps it.

**Poem 4**

God snoozes. I take his reading glasses

and guerilla glue to fix the broken tablets.

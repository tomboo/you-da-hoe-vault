10022025 Opening Sentence with negatives

Nope, not, nix, nada, nothing, nary, nil, none of it --- all the nothing she wasn't thinking about as she pressed an index finger to the ice on the inside of the glass in the living room of Healing House. The ice had formed on the inside of the pane in the cold that had broken the cold records of Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, after nothing but storms.

Nay, negative, never, not, knowt, knot-headed, nothing burger. Now she was thinking of names to call herself so she wasn't, couldn't, wouldn't, didn't think about all the people who weren't around her, all the things that were forbidden to her, all the life that was absent or voided in know-nothing Idaho, not so lovingly renamed Youdahoe, by all the non thinkers who were all joining in the living room of Inner Horizons, because if you landed in Inner Horizons, you were truly the most knot-headed, nabob to to be stupid n enough to get yourself locked up in a psychiatric care center that didn't care, even if you were failing to thrive, with a few barely worth mentioning exceptions, like Margaret and, when he wasn't stoned, Dr. Hazey, the Founder.

Cyn's question

I want to concoct a sentence that amplifies my character[']{dir="rtl"}s depression and grief over losing her family to identify the struggle between life and death she[']{dir="rtl"}s engaged in. I don[']{dir="rtl"}t want the sentence written but want a list of negatives to play with. If you can identify words that rhyme, alliterate or have like vowel sounds please separate them out.

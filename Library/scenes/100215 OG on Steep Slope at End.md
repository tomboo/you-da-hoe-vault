100215 OG on Steep Slope at End

She can hear the car accelerate over the rise. A yellow cone of brightness white and blinding makes her look away. The sudden grind of a downshift. A squeaky squeak. Then an arctic whoosh. Then, to her everlasting surprise, a blast of frigid air pelts her as something as large and heavy as an ocean wave sweeps past her and rushes on down the hill.

She left the pack where it fell.

The hill was lit up by moonrise and milky stars and bright snow reflections as she scuttled, slipping, half-falling to her knees in a blue shadow where a group of tall Ponderosa loom over the whiteness. Up hill, her pack looked like a lump of stone.

She lays her body down across both lanes in an effort to make a bigger target. Flat on her back, she folds her hands over her chest, her preferred position for sleep.

She drops her pack with the peanut butter sandwich and peanut butter cookies she'd cadged out of Margaret for an afternoon snack. Then she scuttles away from it into a shaded blue dip in the road where the tallest Ponderosas loom. If she turned her head, she could see the dark pack like a lump of coal in the bright snow light that washed the road with a silver gloss.

She heard wheels crunch over frozen churned snow and ice. A constant chatter came towards her over the rumble and hum of the engine. A yellow cone of light swept the trees along the roadway, then the brightness seemed to swing and weave as if a drunk was at the wheel.

It seemed to take forever for the car to crest the hill. She heard the downshift of the engine, the chatter of tires over snow crust and broken up ice. Light burst over her body in a yellow cone, then amazingly, it swung and arced away into the trees to the right. A huge dark shape whipped past her, so close, she felt a gale-force blast of frigid wind. It kicked up a blast of ice and snow as if someone had tossed a shovelful of gravel at her on its way by.

Here's what Old Girl remembered ever after. The sound of a downshift. A growling engine like a feral creature. The chatter of tires over chunky ice and snow. A frigid blast of gale force wind that pelted her in the face with shards of sharp rocks and ice.

Here's what Old Girl would remember ever after. The ground was freezing. The snow which looked soft and inviting from a distance hid a layer of black, unforgiving ice.

The engine broke the profound stillness like a predator's growl.

She heard and then felt the vibrating growl of the engine. The chatter of tires chewed up the snow-chunked ice. A downshift, at the crest of the hill. A fleeting impression of dark mass and weight that skidded past. It passed so close to her boots that a frigid gale force wind threw a packet of sharpened needles in her face, followed by a tremendous, earth-shaking bang.

She scrambled to her knees amazed that she'd been passed by, then further astonished by a sight that her mind wouldn't believe.

A truck still running and smoking appeared to have driven up the straight trunk of a Ponderosa. It stands upright, truly vertical. It's back end is buried up to the real wheels in snow and the front wheels are still spinning on either side of the tree as if the driver has his foot on the gas. As she watched, the truck slowly leaned to the side and appeared to swing a short distance around the bole of tree as if gravity had woken up from its own amazement and slowly reasserted itself. A second, much quieter bang sent off a small explosion of snow flakes when the truck fell over on its side, still leaking exhaust.

Old Girl's eyes told her she was seeing something impossible in nature. Trucks didn't drive up trees. They didn't smoke and rumble with front tires spinning while the bed of the truck ground and shuddered in the well of snow at the base of a hundred feet of pine.

She had the fleeting impression that gravity woke up at the same time she rises to her feet. The truck crashed over onto its side, throwing up a cloud of snow and smoke that floated around it like a small explosion.

The truck leaned slowly and almost walks itself around the split trunk, pulling yellow heartwood with it as it fell.

The walk to the hill

Old Girl's boots crunched under her in the silence for the first couple of miles. She slipped and lost her footing when she reached the long descent that the locals called Harrow Hill. She flailed and windmilled a long second trying to stay upright but she slid out of control on the hard pack and banged the back of her head on a skid of black ice.

Old Girl's boots crunched along for the first few miles on the journey away from Healing House. Then, on the long descent that the locals called Harrow Hill one boot flew out from under her and the next thing she knew, the back of her head whacked a layer of black ice that was hidden under a deceptively soft furze of new snow.

For a second, she lay still, feeling her brain ring like an alarm clock waking up to pain. A milky wash of stars winked overhead like a thin fog sprinkled with diamonds. They were vast against an even vaster blackness. So distant it was impossible to imagine the immensity or the eternity it would take to reach them. The ground was hard and unforgiving as granite, as unforgiving and cold as the stars that made her feel like a speck in the universe.

On the ground, feeling cold seep into her bones, she wishes she is still warm in her flannel sheets, listening to the sound of Rachel breathing. She hates to admit, even to herself, that she has grown to like the sound of someone else alive and breathing with her in the darkness. That's when she hears the sound of an approaching car far away.

She shivers, wishing she was curled up in her flannel sheets and listening to the sound of Rachel's regular soft breathing. She doesn't like to admit it but she has grown to like the sound of a friend in the room. Knowing that she isn't alone in the dark feels good. Ever since her best friend's mother told her that Mom and Dad and Gabe were gone, she'd felt separate from the world of the living. Even the reminder of that night and the news that cuts her off from every thing she's ever known makes her colder.

Several inches of snow had fallen after the pass of the snow plough. The road looked deceptively soft. Underfoot though, her boots crunched on a slick layer of ice. Several times, her boot would slide out from under her unexpectedly and she had to catch herself from falling. It wasn't a problem until she reached the steep hill that the locals called Harrow Hill. That's where she fell and whacked the back of her head.

Strenger Road had been snowplowed hours before. A light dusting of snow, maybe an inch or two, covered the old ruts and chewed up chunks of ice and pea gravel mixed with dirt and rocks. It looked deceptively soft as far as Old Girl could see but underneath, her boots crunched on a layer of frozen nd refrozen ice that was slick enough to skate on.

Every few steps, even on the flats, one or the other boot would slide out from under her and Old Girl found herself flailing to keep upright. Eventually she perfected a kind of sliding gait that involved not picking up her soles. The trick was to always stay in contact with the snowy surface and not let gravity take over.

She fell painfully on her ass about halfway down the steep hill the locals called Harrow Hill. She was mincing and duckwalking with smale steps, aware of the icy layer under the hardpack. One boot whoosed out from under her and she was turtled on her back pack with her head ringing like an alarm bell.

She lay still. Discombobulated for a minute. The ground was freezing. She could feel the black ice, hard and unforgiving as granite under a throbbing elbow. She was so cold. And mortally tired. At this rate, it would take her another hour, maybe two, to get to Highway 95 where she had a tiny chance of hitching a ride to I-90 where the big trucks hauled their loads to Seattle.

That's when she heard very faintly in the distance a low rumbling engine. The ruts in her mind took their usual path away from the trouble it took to stay alive to the quickest and easiest path toward death.

She shrugs out of her pack and just leaves it in the middle of the road. She half runs, half-skates down the slope to a blue-dark shadow near the bottom where several of the tallest Ponderosas loom. He won't see me there. She amends her thought to, even if he sees me, he won't be able to stop.

The engine rumble comes closer---it seems to take forever after she lays her body flat in the road trying to cross as much of both lanes as she can to make herself a bigger target. Even a blind man won't be able to miss her.

The engine rumbles closer. It grows in volume until it sounds like a predator's growl at the moment when a cone of yellow light crests the hill. Even a blind man can't miss me, she tells herself when her own eyes are blinded by brightness. For a brief instant, she has the impression that the light is swaying or sweeping back and forth across the lanes.

At the moment the night goes black, a dark mass sweeps past her with a frigid gust of wind like an enormous wave crashing by. It's so close she has a fleeting impression of engine noise and hot oil and rot.

A tremendous crash and whang.

Old Girl brushes at her face in astonishment, wiping away shards of ice and wet and grit as if someone has throw a shovelful of slush in her face. She sits up, eveyes taking a moment to adjust from the burst of bright light back to the dim silver snowlight. Only inches from her boots is a huge tire tread of pushed up, granulated snow that swerves off the road and travels the berm piled up on the road side by the plows. Her eyes follow its unerring path to a mangled smoking impression of metal and broken branches and a tree bent at a crazy angle.

Her eyes follow the tire tracks' unswerving path on the road for a short distance, then angling off to travel the berm of snow piled up by the snow plow before it stops at the grove of looming trees at the bottom.\
It's the weirdest, most impossible sight she'll ever seen.

A large green truck appears to be trying to drive up one of the tall Ponderosas on the forest side of the snow berm. It stands vertically on its back end, the rear tires embedded up to the wheel wells in the snow at the base of the tree with the front wheels spinning on either side of the trunk. Smoke swirls with a small explosion of snowflakes. Headlamps shine yellow light into a canopy of dark branches that hover over the standing truck like dark wings.

As Old Girl takes in a sight she can't believe, the truck begins a slow lean and then appears to almost walk a few inches around the trunk before it whumpfs to its side as if it decidesto give up its impossible road to the stars.

A quieter bang and whang of springs. A puff of smoke. A small explosion of that snowflakes that fly free. The engine \-- Old Girl hadn't realized it was still running\-- abruptly quits. The silence is profound.

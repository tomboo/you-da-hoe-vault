Lydia\'s Bad Behavior

\"Oh holy shit,\" Margaret said. \"You didn\'t inhale and now look! There\'s Lydia.\"

She hauled her big frame out of the van. This seemed to require a lot of grunting.

James watched her cross the front windshield and haul ass toward a red pickup. This time, there was no rapping on the window. She yanked the passenger door open and backed out of the cab with a flailing Lydia. Pants unzipped fist flying, Lydia was pissed. James had been the recipient of Lydia\'s anger and he didn\'t envy Margaret, who was simultaneously trying to shield her face while dragging a kicking round-housing Lydia toward the van.

By the time Margaret got her to the van the guy who\'d been in the truck with her was making a beeline for Margaret. She was busy talking a mile a minute to Lydia and didn\'t see the big cowpuncher with murder on his mind.

James sprinted toward the melee- it looked faintly Biblical, with Margaret\'s death grip on one of Lydia\'s arms and the cowboy in the shitkicker grip on the other, like they were going to split the baby on their own.

Margaret was hollering, \"Let go or I\'m calling the cops!\"

\"She\'s a grown woman! She can do what she wants.\"

\"Not while I\'m on duty,\" Margaret snapped.

\"Who the hell are you?\" The guy looked like he\'d lifted a lot of hay bales with big shoulders and muscular legs. James came and stood shoulder to shoulder with Margaret who was nothing to sneeze at in the size department. James had arm wrestled her for fun and she\'d nearly beat him.

Lydia said, \"Leave her alone. She\'s just doing her job.\"

Margaret had a vicious scratch on her neck from Lydia\'s lethal nails. A look flashed over her face like the job Lydia had just referred to was not worth what they paid her but it was replaced by grim determination.

\"You! In the car,\" Margaret said to Lydia. Margaret pointed to the company van emblazoned with the name, Inner Journeys, and the tagline, \"Let us transport you to happiness with yourself.\"

The cowboy saw the sign and said \"You\'re one of those nut cases?\"

\"I\'m not nuts,\" Lydia said. \"I\'m in treatment.\"

\"Treatment for what?\"

\"Gonorrhea,\" Margaret said.

That let the air out of the guy\'s tires. Lydia shrugged, like \"what can I say?\" and he went back to his truck without another word.

Nobody said anything in the van until Margaret pulled up to the front of Healing House.

\"Here\'s what I can\'t figure out,\" Margaret said. \"Do you two think I\'m blind?\"

James exchanged a look with Lydia. \"What?\"

\"I find James smoking dope in the parking lot bold ass brass. All I have to do is look over 2 stalls and there you are lighting up a joint,\" Margaret fixed him with a dark look. \"The next thing I see is Lydia with her pants around her knees giving some guy she\'s just met a blowjob.\" Now Lydia was getting the Margaret stare down.

\"In broad daylight. In the school parking lot, for heaven\'s sake. Where anyone with a brain in their head and two eyes could see you with you lips wrapped around some guy\'s dick!\"

Margaret threw the car keys in her purse and gathered up her belongings. \"I have two eyes and a pretty good brain. Don\'t insult me by shoving my face in your shit.\" She marched into the house without waiting for them. Lydia said uncertainly, \"Is she going to report us?\"

\"Not if we don\'t pull any more crap,\" James said.

\"It was pretty stupid to get caught like that,\" Lydia said.

\"She\'s a pretty good egg,\" James said.

\"Bad ass. That woman is way more bad add than we are.\"

Lydia Rewrite

Margaret hauled Lydia out of the car like she weighed nothing. Bare naked she probably weighed 100 pounds, not that James had ever seen her naked- only titties one at a time, like small but juicy lemons, and of course the pink rose tattoo on her belly that pointed it\'s thorny stem between her legs. She was kicking and flailing like a toddler having a tantrum and Margaret had her hands full trying to protect her face from Lydia\'s wild punches so she didn\'t see the big cowpuncher dude come around the pickup bed stuffed with rolls of barbed wire.

James was moving to stand back up before a conscious thought hit him. The cowpuncher was about Margaret\'s height but burly and muscular and from the expression on his face, pissed off as hell from having blow job interruptions, thanks to Margaret.

\"Don\'t even think about it, cowboy,\" James said. Margaret shot a surprised look at him but the cowpuncher didn\'t back off. He grabbed Lydia by one scrawny arm and Margaret who had a death grip on her other arm yanked the opposite direction.

Lydia yowled \"You\'re hurting me!\" and then James was on the cowboy\'s back, hauling him backward, away from both women.

He punched the asshole a couple times in the neck, more like slaps with an open fist. All he wanted was to get him to let go of Lydia and get away from Margaret.

But the cowboy was mad now, and he started punching James with his fists and kicking at him with his shitkickers. James took a blow to the side of his head and was thinking to himself, how the fuck did I get here? When Margaret the avenging angel slapped the shit out of Mr. Cowboy with her purse.

Cowboy had his hands over his head and he was backing away saying \"Ok, Ok! Quit, you fucking crazy woman!\"

Margaret did indeed look crazy; her teeth bared, a big fifty year old rotund woman, bitch-slapping a man 25 years younger with a purse the size of a small suitcase.

When she had him on the run, she marched back to James and Lydia who were watching her with amazement. She had an angry red scratch down the side of her face, whether from Lydia\'s nails or the cowboy\'s fist, James didn\'t know.

\"You--,\" she raised the purse in a threatening manner at Lydia who scuttled into the van and went to the very back, as far as possible from Margaret.

\"Jesus H Christ,\" she said, starting up the car and breathing like she\'d just gone 10 rounds in a prize fight. \"I\'m out of shape.\" Nobody said anything the rest of the ride home.

At Healing House Margaret shut off the van and listened to the engine tick. She couldn\'t decide if it sounded more like time was running out or a bomb about to go off.

\"Are you going to fill out a repot?\" Lydia\'s voice broke through the ticking.

\"Did you learn your lesson?\" Margaret answered with a question.

\"Yes,\" Lydia said.

\"And you, James,\" she said. \"Are you going to light up again?\"

\"No.\"

\"Good,\" she said. \"I won\'t tell if you won\'t.\"

She couldn\'t believe how close she\'d come to punching the loser\'s lights out. What the hell was a grown man doing preying on a girl like Lydia? She was 19 but she looked like she was about 13 and she wanted affection so badly she\'s do anything to try to get it, even if it meant sucking off Jed SImplot who should have been old enough to know better. Christ. What she wouldn\'t give to tell his mother, Mary wouldn\'t use her purse, she\'d cut his dick off.

Reflection about consequences.

Now that she was out of her white hot fury at seeing Jed Simplot , a grown man of 30 pushing Lydia into his lap, it occurred to her that maybe there were other options besides punching the loser\'s lights out. Hazey was always telling the kids \"Violence doesn\'t solve anything.\" If that were true, why did it feel so good to whack Simplot into the middle of next week?

She knew she should report James for drug use and tell Lydia\'s therapist about the blowjob but how could she, without coming clean about her own bad behavior? Gretchen wouldn\'t hesitate to rat on the kids, which is how she decided on the spot to sweep the last hour under the rug.

What Hazey doesn\'t know won\'t hurt him, she reasoned. Or me.

She\'d let James and Lydia stew a little. It wouldn\'t hurt them to worry about the consequences of their actions. She\'d been doing it for years and it hadn\'t hurt her, had it? It hadn\'t made her quit losing her temper either, but there was always hope.

Never trust a skinny cook.

Margaret at Costco

I want to write a scene about Margaret doing a shopping run at Costco and going on a jihad about people who don\'t return their grocery carts. It\'s a little \_\_\_of not being too important to take care of the small things as well as the large.

What\'s she mad about? Hazey\'s style of management is to let shit run down hill. Gretchen makes the least paid person in the program\--Gretchen\-- do the dirty work and she takes credit for ideas or work that\'s not her own and it drives Margaret crazy.

A- Everybody do your part and the parking lot will be cleaner. That was Margaret\'s motto but apparently she was the only one who practiced what she preached.

This is a POV, not a scene.

B- A case of Maalox? margaret perused the list and stopped on that one. Who drinks Maalox by the case? She\'d have to ask Gretchen when she got back. It wasn\'t Hazey. That man never worried even when all hell was breaking loose around him.

The next item was definitely Hazey\'s. A case of laxatives. The man\'s drug use had his whole system so stopped up you\'d see him disappear in the bathroom for hours. Gretchen had descended to lurking outside the john to get the good doctor to sign off an purchase orders and office supplies.

Margaret didn\'t lurk. She just shoved papers under the door and found them on the counter later.

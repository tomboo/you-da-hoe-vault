012219 James and Rachel tighten up

Rachel's bedrock response was to turn her own feelings of inadequacy against herself. She couldn't stand how she didn't measure up: to her parents. To her grandmother, most of all to herself. She tried to be nice to or at least empathize with everyone else but she couldn't do the same for herself.

"So how come you're a helper with everybody else but a task master to yourself? What's that about?"

Reza was supposed to be working on his own Impact Letter to his parents. He was uncharacteristically quiet, though every once in a while, a sigh came out of him like a sad wind. After a while, he abandoned the writing in favor of picking at the bandage wrapped around his hand. He'd worried the end so much, it no longer stuck and pretty soon, he was unwinding and rewinding it, trying to get it to behave.

"Would you do this up for me?" he said. "It's driving me crazy."

"Hey, write you own accountability crap. I've got enough problems with my own."

"Not my letter. Help me with the bandage. It keeps coming unraveled."

James got up from his desk and came over to the bed where Reza was writing, propped up by his pillows. He sat down and partially unwrapped the gauze which was grimy and wrinkled from Reza playing with it. "Jesus, this is a mess. Quit unwrapping it or your hand'll get infected."

"Want to see it?"

"Not really."

Reza's face fell. James took pity on him and said, "Okay, fine. It'll be easier if we start over."

When he got the bandage off, Reza's hand looked like raw meat. The skin was red. The dark tine marks looked like fang marks and the area around them was swollen and puffy.

James toughed it gently, off to the side. "Does it hurt?"

"Like a bitch."

"She really got you."

Reza turned the hand over and James was amazed to see that the fang marks were reproduced on his palm like stigmata from a very weird snake. "Man. She stuck the fork all the way through you."

"Good thing she's not any bigger or she would have nailed me to the floor, instead of the table," Reza said.

By then, James had the gauze nicely straightened with no wrinkles. He rewrapped it, round and round, then reset the butterfly clip so it held tight and kept the germs out. Quit fucking with it. I wrapped it tighter so the pressure should make it feel better."

"How do you know how to do that?"

"Mom's a doc." James couldn't count the number of times he'd been wrapped up expertly by her neat surgeon's hands. "I learned it from her."

"Are you going to be a doc?"

"Oh, hell no." James had no idea what he was going to be if he ever grew up but the mountain to climb where she was seemed impossible. "I barely got into USC. Med school would be ridiculous."

Reza sighed his windy sound. "I know what you mean. My dad thinks I'm going to get into Harvard and be an economist like him."

"Parents," they both said in unison, like they were united in the knowledge that genetics made them insane.

"Hey," James said, into the silence. "I'm sorry for what I said last night."

"What?"

"What I said about..." This was harder than Josh made it sound, "... that thing about 'monkey boy.'"

Reza waved him off. "Oh that. You've said worse."

Hard didn't come close to it. This was eating glass.

Reza was inspecting his bandaged hand like it was some wounded thing cradled in his lap. "You call me 'Apu' all the time. That's worse. I'm not even Indian."

James swallowed a big shard.

"Yeah, Josh told me I should apologize for that too."

"Oh, so you're apologizing because Josh said to? That's even worse." Reza squeezed his small body through the very small space open between his headboard and where James was weighing down the mattress. It was like a Houdini maneuver, the way he turned sideways, assiduously avoiding touching James with any part of his body and eeled himself out of proximity.

At the door, he turned back, saying, "Thanks for the wrap job, not the apology, White Boy."

Hoooboy. James was seeing Josh in his mind's eye at the end of the abortive family call when James had hung up on Mom and Dad. "That went well," he had said, his pink palms with the black edges spread in defeat.

Hell, he thought. Why is everything so hard? Does anybody ever catch a break. I meant well. Now I've made it worse.

"I was just kidding."

> "It's not funny."\
> "You said you love the Simpson! How funny Apu is. How much he makes you laugh."

"Jesus, James, Apu's a stereotype made up by some white guy about people he doesn't even know about. Everybody thinks all South Asians run the Korean grocery store. I'm not going to Harbard but I'm not doing that!"

That's when Reza eeled like Houdini off the bed, squeezing through a very small space between the headboard and James's big body. He made damn sure not to touch him.

At the door, his small brown body as stiff as a plank, he said, "Thanks for the wrap job, White Boy. Not the apology."

"Jesus, James. You were there when those assholes yelled at me to go home. What, did you forget? Or didn't you notice?"

Possible places:

1)  Extend Josh/James family call with Josh's later advice about Reza

2)  Add the short apology scene on its own

3)  Add a reference to those thugs who yelled at Reza to go hom in downtown Couer d'Alene

4)  Figure out what to do with queef scene and the fact that Reza has no girlfriend; figure out where to put the memory or scene-in-present time of Reza being at the candy shelves unable to choose.

\--in the van waiting for others to show up for pick-up

\--at the bench waiting for pick-up where they gather

\--in their room?

\--in a joint scene with multiple characters, no supervision at the moment

\--on the hike to Two Mouth Lake where James has to get away from Reza who's annoying him and he runs up to snowshoe with Rachel. Queef could be the intro to how James feels about girls. Could he tell Rachel what Reza said?

\--does James tell Rachel about the candy store observation

"My dad loves candy. Now he can't eat it because he'd diabetic," said Reza.

"I like candy now and then but it's not really my jones." James was thinking about all the other jones that got him into more trouble than a super-sized Baby Ruth.

"I like to eat jelly beans in front of Dad because it drives him crazy. He wants to eat candy so bad, he's practically shaking with rage when I hoover them down."

"Nice."

"You don't torment your parents?"

"Not with sugar." James preferred codeine mixed with tequila or Ecstasy or weed or selling Adderall to fund whatever other torments were on the list.

"My mom says I have his genes and sugar might come back to bite me."\
"Are you worried about that?"

Reza poured another sugar packet into his mouth. "He's old and fat. I'm never going to be like him."

Margaret snorted from the driver's seat. "Don't bet on that. It happens quicker than you think."

Both Reza and James rolled their eyes, secure in the knowledge that the future was ordained for everybody else.

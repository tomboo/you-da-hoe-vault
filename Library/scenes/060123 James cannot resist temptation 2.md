060123 James can[']{dir="rtl"}t resist temptation

THERE WAS THIS OKAY-LOOKING Idaho girl who sat next to James in English Lit class. He'd noticed her because she was always popping her gum. Annoying but kind of sexy, in a country kind of way. She had a thing for red, white and blue spangles. Shit kickers. Her notebook sported a glossy picture of Shania Twain in cut-offs and she'd written on the front in loopy gold letters, \"That Don\'t Impress Me Much.\" Shania Twain was so out of California's main stream, she lived in an alternate universe. James was used to *Do you know the wae?* memes and teeth-chattering GIFs of Kermit the Frog shaking from all the pressure to get into a good college. *Anxiety, LOL!*

The Dixie-looking-chick didn't appear to suffer any life anxiety unless she couldn't decide whether to sign up for a class at NICC or earn \$12-an-hour slinging French fries.

James remembered girls in Malibu middle school with decorated notebooks of Project Runway collages and sayings like "Fierce!" and "I want to be Heidi." Idaho was born behind the times so maybe college notebook styles were just another form of backwardness. Consider that dude in the back row of class who was still rocking crocs way after everybody in California had moved on.

Last Friday, the country girl offered to let him look at her test when Professor Williams gave them a pop quiz.

James had refused, politely, but today she passed him a note while Williams handed back their papers. James got an A on the quiz and a B+ on his Huck Finn paper with a note that said it it would have been an A if it wasn't late. She slid her C minus grade with an urgent "See me! Note under Shania Twain's ass.

Her note said, \"Got some new weed from Tijuana. Want to try it?\"

Did a bear shit in the woods?

After class, she walked him out to a mud-covered Tundra truck in the parking lot near the Student Union Building. James asked her what the deal was with the mammoth trailer hitch on the back and she told him she was a barrel rider. She turned her back to show him the spangled Indian warbonnet sewn onto a short denim jacket. "Wow. '*Queen of the Idaho Warbonnet Rodeo Since 1911,"* he read out loud. "You don\'t look that old."

She snorted, not unattractively.

Professor Williams had this weird habit of calling all the girls Miss So-and-So. Today he'd addressed her as Miss Tempter when he asked her what she made of Huck and Jim traveling South, deeper into slave territory, on their journey on the Mississippi.

"What\'s your real name?\" he asked.

\"Candy."

It was James's turn to snort. \"Candy Tempter? That's hilarious."

"Not Tempter---Tremper.\"

"Oh, bummer." Tempter was way closer to the mark as she expertly rolled a jay between red lacquered nails and pulled a lighter out of a purse with leather fringe as long as her hair.

They were parked in the back of the lot near the fence, a quick walk to the bench down the block where Margaret picked them up and dropped them off. It was close to three. Margaret was due at 3:15. He had plenty of time to chill.

\"Ladies first,\" he said, when she offered him the blunt. She put it between red glossy lips and sucked in and held it in her lungs before she handed it over.

James hadn\'t had weed since the night of the disastrous Tequila and weed and Circle K night in Topanga Canyon. He smelled the familiar, calming smell and he could already feel the slow relaxing of his veins before touching hi lips to the paper. He leaned over to take the joint.

Rap! Rap! Rap! \"James Olson! You get the hell out of that truck!"

Holy fucking shit.

Margaret was standing next to his window. Hands on her hips. Glaring at him as if he\'d beaten her dog.

He looked from her to Candy. "This is awkward."

Candy\'s exaggerated eyebrows flickered higher. \"Who the hell is that? Your mother?\"

\"Um... No.... We're ... not related. \" He had no idea how to describe Margaret. An avenging angel? The vacuum Nazi? A lead-footed van driver and eager-beaver cleaner and 24-hour police?

Rap! RAAAP! Rap! Margaret seemed ready to drive her fist through the safety glass. James shrugged apologetically, opened the passenger door and stepped onto the sidewalk with the smell of weed curling around him like a snake.

\"Thanks for the Shakespeare notes,\" he said,

Margaret got him up by his elbow and she frog marched him away from Candy and her tempting truck all the way down the block to the still-running van.

\"What the hell are you thinking, you nimno? You\'ve been doing so well! Now you blow it when you're just getting it together?" Margaret turned back, mid-rant, and shouted at Candy who was watching them with wide amazed eyes as if Margaret had just roped her calf. \"Stay the hell away from him! Can\'t you see he\'s recovering?\"

James, who was 6- 4", felt like he'd shrunk a foot. He couldn\'t believe how easy it had been to pick up a blunt when he\'d sworn he wouldn\'t ever touch one again. It had seemed so normal, so instinctive in its ordinariness, like he'd been asked if he wanted a Coke or a drink of water and his mouth said yes before his brain registered the thought. He didn't give a shit about the Inner Horizons agreement to take no drugs that everybody signed when they got to the Program; what appalled him was how easy it had been to blindly breakt the rule he'd set for himself.

Nobody else was in the van. According to his watch, James still had ten minutes of freedom which he assumed was going to be spent having his ears blistered off.

Instead, Margaret said clamly, \"Good thing I got here early.\"

\"Why? So you could embarrass the shit out of me?"

\"So I could save you from yourself, nimrod.\"

What the hell was a nimrod? Or a nimno? If it was some kind of Youdaho sheep shit, she had that right.

\"Are you going to write me up?\"

\"Should I?\"

\"I didn\'t inhale,\" he said, with asperity.

Inexplicably, Margaret laughed.

A big har-har-har countrified laugh, unaffected and open. He had no clue what the big woman thought was so funny and it would be years before he heard the phrase \"I didn\'t inhale\" at a party with people of his parent\'s generation who\'d been around when Bill Clinton was president. It would be funny then how he would remember Margaret\'s laugh like it was yesterday, when he hadn\'t heard it in years

["]{dir="rtl"}Seriously, James, don[']{dir="rtl"}t be an idiot and throw away all your hard work."

It wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t be the first time, he thought.

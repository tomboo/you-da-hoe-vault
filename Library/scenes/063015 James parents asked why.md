063015 James parents asked why

James parents were always asking him why he did the stupid shit he was always doing. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time" was the only answer that made sense to him.

He didn't seem to be able to think long term. He never thought about the consequences. Generally, he was thinking, "Hey, this'll be rad!" Or "Whooee!" It was only later, as when he was hanging upside down and staring at the crazy pattern in his shattered windshield, that he wondered where the fun went.

If he was fated to repeat that life lesson forever, how could he bear it?

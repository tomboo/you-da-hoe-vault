022709 Udahoe 1^st^ draft

**Udahoe**

By Cynthia Hartwig

**Process Group**

Nothing ever happened in dog-suck Idaho. Middle of winter, snow falling with the regularity of the minute hand on the clock: one minute it was snowing fat flakes from a slate sky and the next minute and the next hour and the next day and the next month, from October to April, snow continued to fall like sand from an eternal hourglass. Within the first five minutes at Inner Horizons in Couer d'Alene, Idaho, all the residents called it Udahoe. Get it? U- Da- Hoe for getting stuck here.

Old Girl --she refused to answer to any other name \-- had been at Inner Horizons two years, so long she barely recognized the loopy girl signature she made on her intake forms when she was Klonapined up to the eyeballs and frog-marched into the program by two Christ-spouting "escorts" in matching ski jackets. Since being admitted to the adolescent group for 14 to 18 --year-olds, (by 17, she had four suicide attempts to her failing credits, the last one nearly successful). She'd now graduated to the young adults group (18-24) which was theoretically voluntary, unless like Old Girl, your guardians had petitioned the courts to give them Extended Custody because there was a high probability she would off herself. Old Girl couldn't see any difference in the level of maturity between the Adolescents and the YA group, unless you counted the improved facility in psychobabble which came with the territory of three hours of individual therapy every week and once-every-other--day Peer Process Groups, like the one underway.

She was watching an icicle spear stuck to the eaves get longer, the Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry, while Process Group yammered on with the usual crap from Inner Horizon's finest.

A new girl arrived last night-- Darlene, the therapist on duty, introduced her to Process Group as Rachel -- who was marched into Inner Horizons in the middle of the night which meant Mommy and Daddy paid a bundle to get her out of their hair. On her arms, so everyone could see them, were fresh cut marks. Horizontal marks not vertical, so she wasn't serious. Eighty percent of the girls at the program were addicted to self-injury. Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and confiscated your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a fat cook who couldn't follow a recipe if you'd been smart enough to hide the gun you'll want to put to her head.

The new girl doesn't get the deal yet about Idaho. Old Girl knew she was imagining vistas of blue Ponderosa pines and diamond sparkles on lakes as blue as robin's eggs and seeing herself schussing down endless slopes of white. She had the endless part right. Wait till she was trapped by four gray walls and group fucking therapy and emotional shit storms fifty times a day. Old Girl sometimes put her head under the covers at 8 p.m., she was so exhausted by the emotional traumas of 25 adolescent screw -ups.

"Let's welcome Rachel to her new family!" Darlene was a chirper. Family was pretty close to the truth. Everybody sitting in the circle of couches and chairs in the oversized living room was just as fucked up and dysfunctional as a real family, except none of the participants would have forked out \$12, 000 a month for the pleasure. Darlene's happy voice, to Old Girl's practiced ears, took her back to story time in first grade, when Mrs. Frederickson passed out graham crackers and let the class lay on the carpet while she read them stories with happy endings. Here, there were no graham crackers -- Inner Horizons doesn't allow snacks in between meals because of the overload of anorexics and bulimics in the program -- and no stories that Old Girl was aware of with happy endings there was only James Olson, the first participant in Process Group invited to introduce himself by 'taking ownership of his behaviors.': Inner Horizon speak for telling the new girl what fuck-up brought him to a residential psychiatric program with a staff ratio of 1 to 4 in the middle of nowhere.

James Olson, 18, surfer-blond, not yet used to his gangly body (he was famous for tripping over his own feet) ticks off his behaviors in a sing-songy voice. "Substance abuse, alcoholic, DUI, ..." James stops to think. "... and littering."

Yuk. Yuk. Old Girl has heard the joke before. A few of the people here less than a couple months cracked smiles.

Maxie Smith, a pale freckly red head with an infected nose ring, went next: "An-OR-Ex-I-A, Bu-LIM-i-a, self-harm, stealing." Newbie Rachel cast her eyes up to the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. Old Girl felt for her: what were you supposed to do with the next recitation from Princess Leia, the Jewish American princess from Westchester, New York? Sex addict, inappropriate touching with a minor, prostitution, sexual harassment of a teacher. And that was leaving out half the shit she'd gotten in trouble for here.

So it went around the chairs, across the couch. Cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex, shoplifting, peer violence, theft, assault and battery, sibling abuse, incest: you named it, the Inner Horizons family had wrecked their lives a million ways.

Rachel's hunched over, shoulders drawn in, her face a rigid mask of Klonapin affect, newly prescribed.

"Tell us about you," Darlene urged when the circle finally came back around to her. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Rachel opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood, as if she'd been called on to recite, and stepped a few feet into the circle. Then her eyes rolled back in her head and she pitched backwards, knees buckling over the coffee table, straight into James Olson's lap.

\* \* \*

James wasn't there when the new girl was introduced. He'd been late to Process Group because his therapist, Josh, was late for his individual session so they went 15 minutes over. It wasn't like missing out on Process was a big deal. Three times a week under the microscope of your peers would make any normal person insane.

Normal. That was a joke. James was surrounded by the lame and halt at Inner Horizons, all the abnormal with parents who could pay the freight. Like James' parents: Dad, CEO of his own company, and Dr. Mom, a clinical researcher, both of whom were used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh had reminded him of today in his session.

"What the shit?" he said to Ophelia, next to him on the couch, when the new girl stood up. James had been expecting her to walk out. Instead, her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. She went over backward, falling towards him, and when he caught her by the shoulders, he had the unusual perspective of looking at her upside down face into the whites of her eyes. *Exorcist time*. Her pupils were completely sucked inside her skull.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get a wooden spoon!" she yelled at Leia. "Somebody get Bruce and call 911!"

By this time, the new girl was flopping like a fish on the carpet and everybody in Process was sitting forward on the edge of their seats like they were watching Chain Saw II at the multiplex. James was torn between being thankful to the new girl for providing something new to talk about and feeling appalled at the sight of Bruce, the day manager, forcing a spoon between her teeth while Darlene held her by the ears.

James and Reza were instructed to hold onto her legs and the second he touched her, it felt like being attached to someone being electrocuted; James could feel something like a shock wave circling through her body, around and around. Her muscles tensed and clenched and her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, even though James was holding one leg down with his full strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying on of hands on a person seized by electricity, as if a bolt of lighting struck out of the ether-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process group wisdom. After what seemed like an eternity of convulsions, the blond girl's eyes -- very blue, almost opal-- popped open. James had the impression the new girl was looking up him and the other faces clustered around her and wondering whether she'd died and gone to hell. Consciousness -- of what she'd done, not necessarily who they were -- spread over her ashen face like a slow motion wave of horror. *The monster is out of the closet---and it is me*, James thought.

When she sat up, James, still holding onto her legs, surprised himself by squeezing her hand. The fingers were long and thin, fragile as bird bones. She squeezed automatically back, then dropped James' hand as if she'd been burned. James, embarrassed at his clumsy attempt at comfort, jumped to his feet. Her eyes met his and James had the feeling she was seeing him for the first time.

"Are you feeling better?" Darlene was asking her. The new girl was still holding the spoon she'd removed from her mouth. She looked tired and dazed. James thought he could see shame pouring out of her pores, as she inspected the carpet, avoiding all the eyes that were still watching her hoping she'd do something even more bizarre.

Because Healing House (all the houses had lame-oh names) was ten miles outside of town, Darlene and Bruce, the day manager, decided to load the new girl into the Suburban and take her to the hospital; it was faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Micah, one of the Junior Counselors, in charge.

After that, Process Group was officially toast. Everybody basically sat around and replayed what they each were thinking when the girl went down. Alice, the anorexic-bulimic who never thought of anything but food, said, "I thought she was going to barf up breakfast."

Reza, the kid from New Jersey, said, "I thought she was going to the bathroom."

"Didn't they know she was epileptic?" Angela, the mean girl who'd been at the program the longest of any of them, was outraged. "Shouldn't they be more careful?"

Angela wouldn't deign to speak to him, a short timer of only six weeks (an eternity, in his mind). How was he supposed to know she called herself Old Girl. *Excuuuuus e me*. "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you can plan for." James surprised himself by standing up to 0ld Girl. Usually he avoided her rather than give her the chance to jump on him.

Paul, the kid who never *ever* said anything, said, "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like they'd heard from a ghost.

"What the fuck are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her *head!"*

They all laughed then and Paul went back to inspecting his favorite flower in the carpet. James wasn't sure but he suspected Paul was autistic but he'd been too busy with his own shit to find out.

\* \* \* \*

**Peer Interaction**

The itch was reaching Godzilla proportions. It was terrible.. The more you scratched, the worse it itched. Leia had been hoping the newbie would be a boy --a hella-boy with a hella-itch itch to match. She had been seriously bummed when the long haired blond girl stumbled into breakfast that morning asking for coffee. The expression on her face when they said she could have herbal tea!

James was busy stuttering through his list of behaviors in Process Group: Darlene's dopy idea of a welcome ritual for the new girl. James seemed to be confessing his sins to the ozone. A flush crept out of his shirt collar and began climbing up his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school? James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Leia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Leia's experience, which was vast, boys were hella- horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, its implacability (a word on her G.E. D. vocabulary list) they dropped off like flies.

It was the new girl's turn to show her underwear. She stood up and then she went Freaky Friday and started jerking like a break-dancer strung out on Angel Dust. *Maybe they should have given her the coffee,* flashed through Leia's mind.

Leia got the wooden spoon that Darlene screamed at her to get --*what, are they going to beat her with it?* -and then, because she didn't know what else to do, sat down in Darlene's chair while the seizure went on and on. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so freakish Leia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's bag crammed into the chair seat next to her. The wallet was clearly visible at the top. Everybody else was tuned into the freak show. She picked out a twenty dollar bill in one smooth motion and it was safe in her pocket before the jerking and shuddering came to a stuttering halt.

When Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling the blond up to go to the hospital, Leia nudged James from behind, then slipped into the bathroom.

She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the tub pant-less. Some brainiac had installed the old porcelain claw-foot tub on an exterior wall of Healing House. Maybe it was okay in summer but in the middle of January, she half-expected ice cubes to spill out of the tap. Nobody in their right mind ever took a bath in here; Healing House didn't have enough hot water for twelve people, much less heating up a frozen this tm size of an iceberg. Leia could hear her nutcase aunt back in Montreal telling her, "Get in and get out!" when Leia had to take a bath in the winter. Maybe that was why David, her cousin who was three years older, started to crawl into her bed when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. It was perhaps the only kind thing she'd ever thought about him. Was this Inner Horizon shit finally working?

She dismissed that idea like a smell in the bath room. What in hell was taking James so long? She had heard the Suburban rumble past the window on the way to the hospital, she thought.

Then the shower rings jingled and Pavlov's dog couldn't have climbed up James lanky body and thrown its legs around his waist faster than she did. James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was half way down his throat. He was kissing her back when the door flew open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes were locked on Leia's. She could feel a silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to sit her lip to keep a giggle from bursting past her teeth.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being heard-- that, and the fact that the Pee Clogger didn't bother to wash at the sink.

When the door barked shut, her nort flew out like a caged bird. She had bitten down on her lip so hard, she had drawn blood which James wiped off gallantly with the tail end of his flannel shirt. "Shit," he breathed, "that was close." "Not as close as this, big boy." Leia pawed at his belt buckle but James put his hand over hers and held her off. '"Don't," he said. "There's no way I can concentrate. Not after all the shit that's gone down today. "

The itch was strumming in her Leia's inner thighs by then. "Concentrate? What's there to think about?" She had a momentary flash of empathy with the crazy girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Leia shared most of the time. The feeling that her body , never Leia, was the one in charge. If the body didn't get what it wanted, it would seize what it needed, the hell with the consequences. Leia saw the new girl's heels drumming the floor. \"Pleeeeeease!" It came out like a whine, but she couldn't help it. If she didn't set off, she was going to break in a million little pieces.

James was already jingling the curtain rings, on is way out of the this.. \""Just chill," he said, trying to make light of things. The bathroom temperature dropped another twenty degrees as the door shut behind him.

**Outdoor Activity**

**4**

Saturday. Outdoor Activity day. Everybody was running around trying to find their expedition wear. Old Girl, ski-hatted, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy down at the front door, feIt like a pre-schooler. Where's the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and over her neck? Connor, her brother, refused to wear them in the second grade and even now, old Girl can see the expression of surprise on mom's face. Connor, the family diplomat (she's the family fuck-up), made things right by squeezing Mom around the knees. Would that be so hard? Grab Helen by her padded knees and tell her she's sorry for making a mess of her life? The age of miracles has long passed them by.

The sky was the color of cement. The Suburban hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how Josh told them to say it). A French name from some ancient trapper who was looking for beavers to slaughter. It was loud in the van, everybody squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They haven't been let out for Outdoor Activity for more than three weeks because of the relentless snow. People were singing to the radio which was tuned to some country western sob song. Old Girl has never gotten used to the noise. When Mom shipped her out to Idaho after her third suicide attempt, the first thing she understood had been taken away from her was a quiet place to hear herself think.

That's why old Girl sat in the far back, even though it was barf land and cold... At least she was removed from having to make small talk in order to avoid getting marked dorm on peer interaction.

James and Leia already had a one plus a warning for inappropriate touching barely five miles away from the house. Now James sat next to Josh in the front seat, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Leia's crotch. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Leia in the far back. Yesterday, Leia forgot to mention sex addict in her litany of behaviors in front of the new girl. Being a nympho was the first thing she usually hit you with. Anorexic and bulimia and cutting were too garden variety to brag about. Luckily, Leia borrowed somebody's Ipod and emitted tinny hip-hop rhythms from her ear buds so Old Girl doesn't have to pretend she's interested in how many times Leia has traded oral sex for candy in the past week.

Instead, Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons which frankly looked pretty much like the view from their living room window at Healing House, with endless blue-tinged trees and a frozen landscape in which nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About a mile was Old Girl's calculation. Less if it was snowing.

The leader's plan was to snowshoe up to a mountain lake that fed into the main lake. It was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it does, they'll turn around and head for the trail head. The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt like she was always being assaulted. You live with eighteen troubled adolescents and the first thing you realize they've confiscated from you is quiet. Old Girl was used to wearing her Ipod but it had seen stolen by some ass hole two weeks ago. Another IPod was stolen this week. You didn't catch old Girl whining about it, like Leia, next to her, jerking her head to the beat. Old Girl had darker plans for the thief, involving pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular glass shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, absentmindedly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste, until she could have the whole slice.

Rachel heard it before she saw it. A sound like distant breaking glass. Then thrashing and gnashing accompanied by jagged hoarse snorts like a horse in distress. Angela \-- she'd told Rachel to forget her name, the only name she answered to was Old Girl -- raced ahead, followed by James who was fleet as a deer, tailed by Rachel. A thunder crack. An odd whinnying that wasn't like any horse Rachel had ever heard in her junior riding days, got louder, more intense, as they ran.

By the time they reached the lake, the elk was already tiring. Rachel could see the cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged pool of out a hundred yards from shore. An elk floundered there, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. She would lunge part way up, heaving her massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break with her weight. Every time it seemed to get a purchase on the edge, another cliff of snow-covered ice would crack off like a whip. The black water was dotted with snow clumps and floating ice that shuddered and bobbed while the creature swam in circles.

"Holy shit," James voice was awestruck.

"How can we help?" Angela cried out like she'd seen struck. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight of the drowning creature, she registered the fracture of Angela's careful cooler-than-thou facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind while the elk made another lunge. It had huge antlers and starting eyes that rolled in terror as it circled in the freezing water.

"Don't go out there. You'll fall in." James voice was matter-of-fact, as if he'd already accepted the inevitable.

Angela wasn't having any of that crap. "We need a stick!" She started yanking at a clump of downed aspen partially submerged at the lake's edge. She got her hands on a stout branch and was using her bodyweight, trying to break it off at the trunk.

"What's it going to hold on with?" James was looking at Angela as if she were nuts. "Don't even think about going out there!"

"Maybe we can lever it up. Just enough to help it onto the thicker ice. " Angela addressed Rachel like a drill sergeant. Rachel grabbed on to the branch with Angela and with them both jumping near the joint, it finally began to splinter and crack.

Rachel had the ice-laden branch in her bare hands when the elk made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back, and then, as they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its head and body sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of the antlers floating as if suspended by unseen strings above the black water. When the antlers finally slipped soundlessly under, the only sign that the elk had been there were a few slowing whorls in the jagged hole.

The rest of the group joined them on the shore, led by a pissed off Josh. "What the hell were you thinking?" he demanded. "You're supposed to stay with the group." Jose issued his second warning of the day on James, and he said Angele and Rachel were both getting ones for poor peer interactions and rule infractions. Rachel was still fuzzy about Inner Horizons arcane system of "consequences," which involved numbers from one to three for everything from household chores to therapeutic improvement. Angela didn't seem upset, and James was also unfazed.

Rachel opened her mouth to tell the group about the drowning elk when Angela fell into her side, nearly knocking her to the ground. *What the\--?* James had turned away from the group, and was acting like he was busy inspecting a clump of sad aspen saplings with some kind of blight. Rachel took the hint and kept her mouth shut. "Jesus, watch where you're going," Rachel said to Angela, yanking her snowshoe out from her under Angela's foot.

Josh, playing wilderness guide, pointed out the jagged hole in the ice. "Looks like something fell through 'Can anybody guess what?"

Everybody, except Rachel, Angela and James, hazarded an idea. Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big the hole is. You can see its claw marks."

An acne-inflicted boy Rachel hadn't met, rolled his eyes in disgust. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else noticed the tracks and thought maybe a moose fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, and zebras, along with Godzilla and Dr. Buchanan, the head of the program.

A few light snowflakes began to drift in sideways. That ended the nature lesson. Josh called for an about face before the snow got serious and told them to hightail it back to the Suburban. Josh, a native Idahoan, had some weird local expressions. On the car ride up to the trail head, he'd yelled back at one of the kids *Shut your pie hole*. Not a phrase Rachel had heard in the New York bedroom community where she'd grown up until the year both parents were killed in a car fire.

The car fire was the demarcation line in Rachel's maturity. Afterwards, she could never decide if she was hopelessly older or hopelessly younger than her peers. Epilepsy was just the icing on life's bitter cake. Hardly worth mentioning, except for the embarrassment of yesterday's performance. She was still touched that James had tried to squeeze her hand. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Had the black pants she wore like a uniform protected her like she hoped? She couldn't see how.

030609 Lights Out

Close to 10 p.m. She had put her things in order. Cleaned up her side of the room. Liberated more hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there was an exit survey, Old Girl would have written *Buy some more hangers* under suggestions for improvement. *Fire the cook* would be good too.

To note or not to note? The problem with noting -- she'd been reading Shakespeare' s (insert title of "Noting" comedy) was that she could think of nothing to say that would make any difference. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Indianans, had tried everything on her behalf. SSRIs, psychotherapy, dialectical behavior treatment, prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies), once (in desperation) some New Age regressionquack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her on the carpet like a rug salesman: all in the spirit of making her "better." Rachel was pretty sure it didn't get any better than this and why make her aunt and uncle pay for better when worse was what she'd finally accepted? Something banal, perhaps, like " It wasn't your fault, " or "You did your best," then. She doubted it would make any difference to those two nice people who, but for fate and a fraying lamp cord, would still be taking their three a year vacations in Hawaii instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Angela\'s treatment. Her parents had left behind a reasonable insurance policy but after three years of "treatment" it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess the money was running out.

Why they did it, Angela couldn't imagine. If she'd pulled the shit on herself that she pulled on them, she'd have tossed herself out on the street. In one of he suicide attempts-herthird? Fourth? -- she'd sled all over the white grout in their new bathroom.they replaced it without a murmur. So no note? Just a cancelled invoice from Inner Horizons with "paid in full" written across it. Old Girl wished she'd thought of the idea before the bookkeeper locked up her office. It would have been easy to make up a business class assignment that she needed it for.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter. "

"Me, too." A pause. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Tina who had borderline personality disorder and high anxiety and who knew what else in a witches brew of genetic malfunctions. Rachel hadn't said more than "Good morning" and "Night-night" since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to life at Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding one.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Angela's writing wasn't going well." You keep sighing. And fiddling with your dreads." Old Girl didn't know she'd been sighing. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. *Angela has a stash of pills hidden in the closet.* That had cost her a trip, early on, to Stabilization where Klonapin turned her into a Zombie.

"Nothing new to report. You can only say 'it snowed' so many times. "

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote," It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

Rachel was looking at her from the confines of her bed. "You're funny. And smart."

"Am not!"

"You are. I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group." Rachel couldn't remember saying anything in Process; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down and endure in silence the emotional shit storms that made the air of Healing House fairly vibrate with anger and hurt and despair.

"What'd I say?"

"Leia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Leia *always* brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring to listen to. Had Old Girl meant what she said? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A dumb job at the Tasty Freeze wasn't going to pay for tuition or school books. She wasn't planning to make a habit of prostitution, she\'d just do it until she had enough for a deposit on a decent studio apartment. Then she could get by stripping. She wasn't big-boobed but she knew she had a nice ass, if the boys at Inner Horizons were any judge.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form. She'd saved up some Benadryl from a bee sting and had them ready to dissolve in the fat, slobby night mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket, the inner one next to her heart, was a hundred dollars she managed to save by a combination of taking back stuff she bought with her allowance (if it was under \$20 bucks, most stores would just give you the cash) and, working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had dropped off to sleep so she was startled when she heard her ask,, "Did I look horrible when I seized?" Old Girl turned her chair around, so she was facing Rachel, who lay on her side, covers pulled up to her chin like she'd tucked herself carefully into bed. "Like a carp." She paused. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel actually snorted at this snorer. "*See*, you are funny." Her smile proved to Old Girl that once again, whenever you told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, she could hear, coming toward their room, Charlene's corduroys wearing themselves out between her rubbing thighs. *Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka.* Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed down the hall, giving Old Girl plenty of time to hit the lights.

Out in the hall. Charlene was stopping at every door way telling people to hit the hay. "I'm just taking a pee," 0ld Girl called to her. Closing the bathroom door from the outside, she made sure Charlene didn't turn and catch her waiting by the door. Charlene's cocoa cup was in the living room, next to a *Self* magazine open to a make-over page. Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight. The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked unbearably sad. Charlene must bring her own canister of whip with her every night. Old Girl wished she'd seen nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the spreading cream.

> \* \* \* \*

At 2 a.m., the beeping of her watch alarm (she'd put it next to her pillow to avoid waking Rachel) pulled her out of deep sleep. She was so far under in the still dark waters of sleep, she didn't want to come up. She considered running the next night but dismissed the idea because she'd was out of Benadryl..

Charlene was snoring gently on the couch, mouth open. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. We're all on our own, she told the crystalline splash of stars. She'd never seen so many stars, sharp as cut glass overhead Had they ever seen the Milky Way in Jersey, she wondered. Only at the Planetarium. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted down, as if the stars were shedding light. Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked . Her boots creaked with every step. A sign that the temperature had dropped into the teens. She had been here so long, she realized, she was becoming an Idahoan. *I speak snow*, she thought, and like Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to go back to her bed and sleep.

Her plan was to walk three miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by a truck heading south. Then at I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with another long haul trucker. If she got lucky, maybe she could sleep in the cab unless the driver wanted company. She had a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt. Even a five-and-dime special called Greatest Country Western Standards of Nashville. Better than sex, she planned to say. She hoped she got a trucker who thought so.

She'd been walking awhile and was near the bottom of a long hill (she hadn't realized the road was so up and down from a car) when she heard a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct was to get off the road and stand unseen, near one of the giant Ponderosa pines that reached long fingered branches to the stars. She'd been thinking about the elk at the frozen lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to get up on the ice. That was too painful to remember. Instead, Old Girl saw the moment the elk had given up. The calm that came over its huge dark eyes. The way the sun, which had fought its way through the clouds, caught the antler points with its weakened rays. She imagined the elk sinking down through a column of blue to the darkness below. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held regally toward the receding light.

It would be breathtaking, floating long legs and a radiant, sun-sprinkled glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. Fish skeletons. A wedding ring. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial-blue beast, like the jewels of a ruler of the floating realm.

The engine noise was coming closer. She was at the dip in the roadway at the bottom of the hill where it would be hard to see a dark object until it was too late. She lay down on her side, facing the blinding lights and waited for the struggle to end.

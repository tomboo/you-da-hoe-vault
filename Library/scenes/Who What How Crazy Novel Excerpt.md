YA Novel Excerpt

**Who What How Crazy?**

**By Cynthia Hartwig**

Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy with only the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Ten other Young Adults locked up with Old Girl at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment center in Coeur D'Alene, were straggling into the living room of Healing House for Process Group. People flopped or curled up in fetal position on the three couches arranged in the usual off-kilter circle before the gong rang. Nobody wanted to get written up for being late.

Healing House's living room looked Idaho-homey. All earth tones and nubbled beige. To Old Girl's way of thinking, the decor reminded her of home in the worst way. It made her remember what home was supposed to be like without coming within a million miles of it.

Darlene, the Lead Therapist, took the only wingback chair and called Process Group to order. She introduced the newest member of the Inner Horizons team like a cheerleader -- "Meet Rachel Interlachen! Yay!"

A week ago, Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two Mormon Church men in matching ski jackets. That meant Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to have their flipped out, freaked out, drugged addled daughter personally escorted to Idaho to get her out of their hair.

Rachel, tall and hollow-faced, looked like she was 15 though you had to be at 17 to belong in Young Adults. She wore a "Give Up the Ghost" tee shirt. On her wrists, horizontal cut marks. Not vertical. So, a garden-variety self-injurer like every other girl in the program.

Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a skinny cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Old Girl tuned out and contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear hanging from the eaves. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the largest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth lining the picture window. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

Snow had started falling last October and was apparently going to keep falling until May. It snuffed out any hint of the ring of massive Ponderosa pines around the yard. A dim sulfurous yellow light beat through the gloom. Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up in rural Idaho, all the inmates called the place You-Da-Ho? Get it? You -- Da -- Ho, for doing whatever fucked up shit that landed you in the middle of the Idaho wilderness with people even more fucked up than you.

Old Girl was eleven when she first raided the medicine cabinet at her guardians' house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the alphabet along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed and fish oil crowded the shelves. Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that crapping yourself to death was the world's shittiest way to go?

Now 17, after spending a year and a half in Adolescents, Old Girl applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to off herself. Nothing gross, for example, like Ex-Lax. Ditto, Ipecac. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor who thought she'd been pushed beyond the ropes---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water she'd vomited so hard that a blood vessel burst in one eye ---all bodily fluids were verboten. Double-ditto road rash, like the kind she got when she fell out of Uncle David's Buick on the way home from middle school. She'd let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door and learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. The car had to be going at least thirty-five miles an hour or it wasn't worth all the handwringing and recrimination, not to mention a broken arm and a cup of gravel that had to be hand-picked from her hip with tweezers.

Hanging was also off the approved list. Mom and Dad and Gabe were killed in a car crash so she'd had to leave Girl Scouts before she learned knot tying. The only thing she knew was a slipknot. A further objection to asphyxiation was something she'd read about how your tongue swelled up and then hung out of your mouth like a banana slug. Nope. None of that.

When Old Girl "graduated" from Adolescents to Young Adults after Christmas, they moved her out of Calm Cottage in downtown Coeur D'Alene. Healing House was located 15 miles from town on the border of the Kootenai National Forest.

She couldn't see any improvement in the level of maturity in Young Adults unless she counted the advance in psychobabble. Everybody sprawled on the overstuffed couches could spout like paid professionals about accountability and self-actualization and personal validation. Except no one would volunteer to go first.

During breakfast, she'd heard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling at the fix-it guy who picked up the trash whenever he felt like it. Margaret hollered at him from the front door to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand still and let an ice shard put you out of your misery. How would you know when it was ready to drop? The tension in Margaret's voice made it seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who drove a rackety ancient truck like a maniac. Maybe melting was the key. Was it the cycle of melt and freeze that thickened the thing into a weapon?

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straightened hair fan out in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process that formed dreads had squeezed the copper into the color of cardboard. Death would flatten the freckles, she supposed.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job. Margaret would have to wield the scissors. Anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Lydia Bronfman was a cutter. She had to "take responsibility" first because Darlene "volunteered" her. Lydia was also a nympho and a bulimic and the only child of some famous beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the mid-west in her nasally singsong about fucking Axel Friedman, her therapist. Everybody was mad at Lydia for getting Axel fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why Lydia was apologizing. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall since she had sex with everybody. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat alone in the corner, could count that high.

Lydia seemed to be channeling Marilyn Monroe with her breathy list that included blowing and sucking and corn holing. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she said. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody was saying."

Darlene rapped her clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by large sapphire earrings. "How can I take ownership if I don't tell what I did?"

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Old Girl had the worst time sleeping because her mind was too busy fabricating death scenes. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Vera Wang dresses. Weather and setting, depending on her mood, varied between dark and creep-meister or grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she would imagine a fishing boat that sailed on oblivious to a body falling out of the sky. Tragedy didn't have to slap you in the face.

She wondered how much warmer it had to get to make the icicle do its work. The problem with real life was that there was so little you could control.

"Angela! Wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice cut into her day- dreaming. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle, Angela," Darlene said.

Old Girl shook her head. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally would *not* answer to the name she'd been given before her family vanished. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and an ache in her throat from having her stomach pumped, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, the new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why not Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?" Darlene said.

"I don't know anybody named Angela."

"I'm sorry. Would Old Girl please join us?" Darlene put air quotes around the name "Old Girl."

The pleasures of double homicide-suicide flitted through her mind when she swiveled obediently back to the group. On the bright side, she added the 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Lydia was now going on about how she'd coerced a police officer with a blowjob. Her short black curls bobbed over a pink cashmere sweater. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene sighed, then flipped to a clean page on the clipboard. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist shake up after Axel's departure.

Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized founder of Inner Horizons, was Old Girl's therapist. He had a Yale degree in psychiatry on his office wall that said he specialized in Adolescents, which was funny since the old far was practically senile. She'd seen the year 1986 on one of a dozen diplomas mounted on his office wall on a day when she was too wound up to sit during session. That would mean Hazey had to be what... almost fifty?

James Olson, the blonde, quiet surfer from Malibu, California, was telling the group how he got caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack. Small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program which was crashing his birthday Porsche stoned on weed and poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd said in one of those tense, shame-fests that made you want to climb in bed and never get up. Darlene asked how he could afford Jelly Bellies on his \$5-a-week allowance and he told her he traded his Revos for the candy.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high.

"Who'd you trade with?" Darlene asked.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, a meth-addict motor mouth, had supplied the candy because the Revos were currently hanging off the back of his New York Jets.

Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. If you made it through three months without running away, Young Adults were allowed to take 10 credits a quarter at community college "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with his trade. At Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy he lost his sunglasses and another pair would arrive via Fed Ex. Ching-ching-ching. That's how a galaxy of Milky Ways ended up stashed under his mattress.

A drip of moisture beaded and rolled down the icicle to the edge of the eaves. It hung there as if time in Idaho was stretching to its farthest dimensions. Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time nine people in Group processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism --- if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it--- and then it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged the new arrival to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced at the ceiling as if she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's failures had aged her. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled slowly backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

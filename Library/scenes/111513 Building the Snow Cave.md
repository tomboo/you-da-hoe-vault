111513 Snow Cave Building

an Impossible Choice

When Old Girl came to the program, she thought she'd be able to act her way out in a month or two. It took about six months to figure out that she was stuck in a Catch 22 for crazies. If you acted nuts like Etsy---throwing her breakfast bowl of Cheerios when Reza wouldn't pass the sugar, smashing the mirror in the bathroom with her fist, standing on her therapist's desk and screaming, they sent you deeper into Nutsville or what they called Stable. Stabilization. If you acted normal, didn't engage, didn't misbehave, did your chores, worked on being pleasant, turned in your homework on time, and went to their stupid R&R, you were treated as equally nuts. "Faking it." "Passing." "Severely depressed. Probably suicidal."

If she hadn't been suicidal when she came in, she certainly was by the time she'd been there a week.

Every idiot incarcerated at Inner Horizons was stuck there. No one ever got out on their own volition. You were stuck like flies in Superglue, she thought in her darkest moments, because there was no incentive to the jailers for you to get well. Your parents---or in her case, her poor aunt and uncle---kept forking out the exorbitant fees and Dr. Hazey bought another Mercedes that you knew you had paid for, and the status quo went on while she could have burned the money in a bonfire and at least have gotten warm.

They were all standing around at the moment in front of a dispiriting fire out in the middle of bumfuck-wilderness. Josh, the guide, had resorted to pouring the gallon of lighter fluid on the wet wood to get it to burn and after the initial whoosh of flame, the logs went back to smoldering. Dank, wet and blackened with a lot of smoke and no heat.

Everybody was wet and freezing. They'd trooped up a mountain, breaking through crusted over snow and slogging up to a flat meadow where Josh demonstrated how to build a snow cave.

He'd divided the group into teams of three and then given them a two hour deadline make their own caves. Old Girl got stuck with Reza who weighed about 90 pounds and couldn't keep on a task if you tied him to the Ponderosa pine they chose to build their cave next to. James was supposed to be on their team but he begged off with the excuse that since Reza was his roommate, it was cruel and unusual punishment to make him be on his team too.

That left Etsy. This was her first week back from Stable and she'd come back so pumped with whatever downers they'd given to control her, she was nearly catatonic. Today she had her eyes open but she lumped along in her men's size 10 boots and overalls in sullen silence like she was a Zombie.

When the sky started to drizzle and spit, old Girl knew why death seemed way more appealing. If somebody put her in charge, she'd put Etsy out of her angry misery, then follow her over the chasm in a New York minute.

Unfortunately, all she was given were Idaho minutes, a euphemism for eternity, while they dug deep, wet snow for hours. She and everybody else sweated up a storm and they'd all stripped off hats and gloves and jackets to claw and fling the heavy concrete snow away from their structures.

Surprisingly, Etsy got into snow removal. She was a one-woman excavator, chugging along like a machine with the one shovel they were given. Why they couldn't all have shovels for the Sisyphean task was anybody's guess. Welcome to Inner Horizons, a trip through Inner and Outer hell.

Reza wandered off during the digging to bug James, so Old Girl and Etsy hunkered down and concentrated on snow removal until they had a space big enough for maybe a fox or a small coyote to crawl into. The walls were supposed to be three feet wide. They'd followed Josh's instructions to create a round domed space and dig a trench to make a narrow tunnel for an entrance below the level of the cave floor. That way, heat was supposed to rise. At the end of two hours, Old Girl could just barely shimmy on her belly through the passage to a dim, slightly lumpy space that she couldn't turn around in. It felt cold and clammy lying on snow in your wet Capilene underwear shirt and rain pants that were soaked with sweat. Maybe you wouldn't freeze to death but you sure as hell would want to if you had to spend a night stranded in the woods.

She was just lying in the cave, taking a break from trying to dig out a space big enough for an Etsy-sized person, when a muffled sound of whooping and shouts began to work their way into the gray dim space. She was thinking of backing out feet first through the tunnel when a giant weight whumpfed down on her without warning. Her face was buried in corn snow in the well of her outstretched arms. It felt like a giant rhinocerous was standing on her head and back. It was dark and she had a nose and mouthful of snow and she couldn't lift her head to breathe because of the rhinocerous's weight in wet concrete encasing her head to toe.

The cave fell in? It seemed astonishing to her that she'd been buried alive doing exactly what she'd been told. She'd been following instructions to the letter and now she was being crushed to death and she was slowly suffocating no more than a few feet from 15 people. I'm dying. There is a God. Her last cogent thoughts.

"Crap! Crap! Crap!" Somebody was singing a repetitive litany that sounded like a rapper's prayer.

She came to on her back in the snow with Josh giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which was slightly icky because she could taste left-over tuna fish on his breath and she could feel her chest rise with the strange sensation of him blowing something warm and tuna-ish into her throat.

She wanted to tell Josh she was all right. To say that she was awake. That she was conscious and aware that Reza was dancing next to Josh like a demented imp singing "crapcrapcrap" in a holy litany while Josh knelt over her and breathed into her lungs.

It took forever before she was able to wave her hand around and turn her face away from Josh's mouth. She couldn't seem to form words but she coughed a deep racking cough. "Oh holy Christ, she's alive!" Josh cried.

He hauled her to a sitting position and Etsy, no longer sullen and wide awake, was slobbering on her neck and laughing and Josh was pounding her on the back and hugging her and Reza and all the other kids who'd been lurking in a worried circle were dancing around in the snow like they'd lost their minds.

Then it was her turn to pat Etsy who was now blubbering aloud, with tears running down her pillowy face, saying, "There. There. It's OK. I'm OK. I'm breathing."

The story was that Reza had started lobbing snowballs while Old Girl worked on their cave entrance and then James and Rachel had joined forces with Reza and they started a huge snowball fight with the other kids and when Etsy got hit in the back of the head with an ice clump, she chased Reza around the the snow caves with her shovel intending to brain him as payback. Reza, wiry and skinny and wicked fast, had no trouble running from Etsy but while he was running in circles and taunting her, he whipped around the Ponderosa pine where they'd built their snow cave, forgetting that they had been digging out the snow under his feet, and he wiggled his skinny ass in a little war dance while jumping on the roof of the snow cave with both feet. About the time that Old Girl had been thinking about crawling out to see what all the noise was about, the cave fell in on her.

It wasn't just snow that suffocated Old Girl, they told her. It was fucking Reza who quite literally stood on top of her and did his gorilla dance. No wonder she felt like a Mack Truck had parked on her, she thought, when Etsy's crying jag with her little gasps for air and wheezes finally slowed and her shoulders stopped shaking.

The fire and the gallon of lighter fluid were for Old Girl's benefit but because the logs wouldn't really catch because they were wet and everybody was cold and getting colder by the second, Josh had her frog-marched down the trail back to the van between James and Etsy. Old Girl was still light headed and her ears were ringing and though she didn't want to complain, her back felt like it was on fire. It felt good to have the two biggest people in the program propping her upright and keeping her moving between them.

Etsy said, "If you were dead, I would have killed Reza."

She said it like a gift. It was a gesture of solidarity and attempt to make amends for Reza being an idiot and a fuck-wad.

"Do it anyway," James said. "Then I won't have to have him as a roommate."

They all laughed. Reza was down in the front of the line with Josh giving him insta-therapy of the basic, "You're an idiot" and "Don't you ever think?" variety. He shuffled along, staring at his feet and for one magic moment, when Old Girl saw the Inner Journeys blue van up ahead and felt the warmth and support of James and Etsy on either side of her, it felt damn good to be alive.

Amp it Up

Both Reza and Etsy had to write accountability letters to the group.

Reza had to say he was sorry for not shoveling and carrying his load during the snow cave building. Then he had to explain why he thought it was OK to have a snowball fight---"it was 'social' right?" We call it Social Recreation, right? And throwing snow balls gets us working together in teams, right?" Reza's dad was some mucky-muck attorney in Camden, New Jersey, famous for big settlements for little people against greedy corporations. In thirty years, Old Girl could see Reza with a balding head in a sharkskin suit using his massive intellect and argumentative skills to get the devil off in a paternity suit.

Reza had the whole of Group in stitches until Dr. Shapiro said with a sigh, "We'll take this up in individual therapy, Reza. Sophistry is not accountability and you know it." Score 1 for Reza, Old Girl thought.

Etsy's accountability letter was very short. "I like Old Girl. I hate Reza," seemed to be its main theme. There was also a good argument for "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." She described chasing Reza around the meadow with an upraised shovel and threatening to bash his head in. "I thought he killed Old Girl," Etsy said plaintively. "He deserved to be punished."

This was how Old Girl pieced together exactly what happened while she was slowly smothering to death under the snow. At first, she thought would have been nice to be there while it was happening. But then, after the telling and retelling that went on all day and night when they got back to Healing House, she decided it was OK to have missed it. Nobody could stop recounting the events that lead up to Old Girl being buried alive and pulled out without breathing. Soon, the story would pass into the oral history of Inner Journeys, like the story that got told and retold about the bulimic girl who stashed her puke in the closet of a bedroom for a month, or the cutter who bled so much, they had to retile the bathroom and replace the grout.

Old Girl woke up in the middle of the night wishing she had a shovel so she could beat Reza's brains out because that's what the pain in her back made her feel like. She debated getting up and going to the infirmary but you had to be practically dying before they'd give you any pain meds. "Drug seeking behavior" pretty much cut off help in that quarter.

While she was ruminating about the shovel and wondering what the happy ending to the story would have been if Etsy had caught up to Reza before he stepped on the roof of the snow cave, she realized she was conscious of smoke. Not cigarette smoke. Real smoke. And it was sifting in to her room from under the door.

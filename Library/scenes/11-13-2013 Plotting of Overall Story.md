Plotting of Overall Story

I want to lock in midpoint which is typically the point at which there is no going back. It\'s not necessarily as a formal device with so many multiplying POVs; I think the action that happens in each scene drives the reader forward and I can use Garbage man\'s creepy activities to drive tension.

So may Garbage man Russ is the key to midpoint.

What is the point at which he isn\'t ask to turn back.

- It could be the scene where Rachel runs out to dump her garbage and Russ gets a good look at her long legs and muscled ass in a too short tee shirt she slept in.

- Or it might be the claw scene where he jerks off at the window

- Maybe I should write two scenes. One is the initial claw exploration. The second scene is the jerk off scene

- It could be written as a bailing scene where Russ is in his filthy shop and he\'s putting together the jerry-rigged claw. It\'s more\_\_\_\_ to see the claw in action so maybe I should just let the claw travel and write the earlier scene from the POV of the seeing eye claw.

The 1^st^ Appearance of the Claw

Rusty is having an out-of-body experience. All the pictures he got developed at Rite Aid are spread out over the \_\_\_\_ light clamped to the work bench so he can see exactly what the claw saw on its first reconnaissance mission at the nut house.

It was like having a seeing eye dog except you didn\'t have to feel the claw or listen to it whine when you chained it to a tree and forgot to give it water.

Twenty-five 4 x 6 images from a darkened bedroom. There was no way to use the camera flash \-- too goddamned bright and even though the kids were stupid, and slept like the dead, it was too risk to light up 20 times so the pictures left a lot to the imagination.

He was going to have to get a better lens or up the ISO. The claw hand was great at picking stuff up. He\'d fashioned it on the model of a fake hand he\'d seen with a sharp hook and a trigger you could pull back when you wanted to grab and go.

Back to the drawing board for the seeing eye. The gray and black images were so grainy you could hardly make out what you were looking at. A white tee shirt with the words \"Trust me I\'m a doctor\" came out good. A drawer full of pale undies all twisted up with each other like they were having sex wasn\'t bad. It wasn\'t what he imagined the claw should have dragged one of the lacey ones up by the crotch and laid it out flat so he could have the picture of the tiny thong and a pale triangle of see-through fabric that had recently kissed up to skin.

Since the photos were too dark to see much, Rusty had to go inward to imagine the path of the seeing eye. He saw the silver shaft that he\'d welded the camera mount to snaking towards the bed with a sleeping body. Click. A shot of blond hair spread across a \_\_\_\_ pillow. Click. A closeup of a hand relaxed and open in sleep. click. A sleeping face with lips open. A tongue faintly glistening and wet. Russ\'s mind\'s eye traveled through the bureau drawers as the claw pulled open each treasure chest until click \-- click \-- click it found the mother lode of panties and tampons and bras.

Back to the drawing board. He jerked back to the grime covered work table with its awls and rasps and acetylene canisters and heads. He gathered up the sorry snaps and dropped them into the paper bag he used for garbage. He was going to have to part with some auto parts. A better camera with a high speed lens.

Instead of seeing grainy dark blobs, Rusty looked through the camera lens and saw what it saw when the claw and the shaft traveled the room. Blond long hair spread like a veil over a white pillow. A hand curled open, relaxed in sleep. Lips \-- open and gleaming wet with the promise of tongue \-- behind white, perfect teeth. If luck was with him \-- and it was in his mind, so luck could be anything he wanted \-- the covers magically drew back. She was hot. She\'d shucked off her blankets and she was wearing the tee shirt she\'d been wearing the first time he saw her. She was on her stomach. The shirt rucked up under her. The globe of a muscled ass like two moons rising to reveal a dark valley of pleasure in the cleft.

Lorenzo Reveals How he Got Thrown Out \-- 2^nd^ write

\"I don\'t get this. The guy\'s like, what? Forty? Fifty? And he\'s got four women and now he wants a 15-year-old. That\'s sick.\"

\"You don\'t understand...\"

\"I understand plenty. The guy\'s a horndog. God, can you imagine having sex with a 50-year-old? That\'s disgusting!\"

Rachel was thinking of her mom\'s latest husband, Floyd. He had a dropping 50-year-old body \-- she\'d seen him with his shirt off, driving his big yacht with a highball in one hand, wearing a captain\'s hat, his \_\_\_\_ drifting between a silvery patch of hair. She shuddered.

\"You\'re going to be 50 at some point,\" Lorenzo was laughing at her. \"It\'s not the end of the world.\"

\"I hope it\'s the end of sex,\" she said. \"Old men are horrible. All that sag and drag.\"

\"How would you know? So you have personal experience?\"

\"Hello no! I have some standards!\" She was about to say she wouldn\'t fuck a 50-year-old with a 10-foot pole but then she remembered Lorenzo was surprisingly squeamish about sex talk. Mormons, she thought. They have all those kids and what? It\'s the virgin birth?\"

\"So who was the girl your stepfather had an eye on?\"

\"Orah was my cousin. On my mom\'s side.\"

\"Eww. She\'s your mom\'s cousin and he wants to marry her. Isn\'t that a little incestuous?\"

\"Half of Hildale is related to each other,\" Lorenzo said. \"Most of the families go way back to the 1850s. It was a big deal when they outlawed plural marriage back in the day. That\'s why they broke off from the main church and became FLDS.\"

\"FLDS? What\'s that? It sounds like Noah\'s Ark. Flood? Get it.\"

\"You\'re a nut,\" he said. \"A funny nut, but still. FLDS stands for Fundamentalist Latter Day Saint. We\'re the cast-offs of the Mormon religion.\"

\"Sounds like you\'re last off of your Mormon family,\" she said. \"Pretty much.\"

\"You have no idea,\" he said.

After that, they both had to get to class. They separated at the door to the student union building.

\"Thanks for telling me,\" Lydia said. \"It must be hard!\"

He gave her a little Charlie Brown crinkly smile. He didn\'t look like the evil Jack-in-the box anymore. He looked like a big, lonely red-headed boy with big feet and a broken heart. Usually she associated big feet with a big dick, she realized. Was she becoming more mature without even knowing it. Nah, she thought. it would take more than that for the leopard to change its spots.

Margaret and \_\_\_\_\_\_ scene

Hazey\'s derelict old van crapped out on the way into town. Fuck a duck. Nine kids and Margaret by the side of the road waiting for the Triple A. Gretchen picked up four of the kids and they crammed into the \_\_\_\_\_ car, Ford Fiesta, a winter car hazard that confirmed to Margaret beyond a doubt that a college degree did not prove intelligence. James and Lydia and Rachel all had 11 o\'clock classes. So she kept them behind with Reza, the brainy one who could miss all his classes and still get As and send the others in the Fiesta. Luckily, Charlie wasn\'t at work so he came by with his SUV and gave it to her, so she could get the kids to school and he said he\'d stay with the van and get a ride with the Triple A.

\"Thanks, honey. You\'re a good kid.\"

\"Raised by the best,\" he said. \"You\'d beat my ass if I wasn\'t.\"

She drove off in the snow with the sound system Charlie was so proud of. Her last view of Charlie in the rear view mirror, she saw that he was spraying the windshield with the Windex she kept in the drawer. She hadn\'t had a chance to clean it and her glass was filthy because Hazey was too cheap to let her take it to the car wash more than once a month.

Lydia had commandeered the front seat and she screamed when she pulled a CD from the case Charlie kept in the front seat. \"Macklemore! OMG, I\'ve died and gone to heaven!\"

Immediately the voice of a rapper filled the car and the kids in the back seat started whopping like a pack of Indians. \"Crank it up!\" James, the quiet one, hollered out and DefCon 5 blasted through the front and back speakers.

It took Margaret a minute to realize the kids weren\'t just randomly whooping. They were singing \-- chanting, kind of, because it wasn\'t exactly what you\'d call singing a recognizable tune though there was a kind of tuneful arrangement to the mesmerizing voice.

The thing was, the kids were music starved. Hazey believed that iPods and ear buds kept kids from engaging with the real world so the first thing that happened when they came to the program was being unplugged. They took away the iPods and iPads and cell phones and Margaret couldn\'t even have a transistor radio to keep her company when she cleaned. Contraband. Strictly verboten.

The kids had been talk-yelling along about being on Broadway and doing it my way and then they shifted to something you could finally snap your fingers and sing along to.

\"Can we go back, this is the moment/Tonight is the night, we\'ll dance till it\'s over.\" She could hear Rachel who so rarely said boo, singing in a clear bell-like voice. Reza and James were singing with her. \"So we put our hands up, like the ceiling can\'t hold us, like the ceiling can\'t hold us.\"

Margaret, who loves music, went from an insane desire to turn off the stereo system to an even more incendiary desire to leave it on and keep the kids singing.

They were barreling along between snow covered fields. The road underneath was bare and wet, no ice to worry about, the snow tires good and grippy so Margaret could relax that feeling of taking the life of the kids in her hands in the rattletrap van. She had the heat cranked up to high to thaw everybody out after their hour\'s wait by the side of the road. And the singing and rocking they were all doing made the Explorer seem like a little island of warmth and community with Macklemore just a part of the camaraderie.

Lydia jumped out of the car and flashed Margaret a white open mouthed smile. \"See you at 3,\" she said which might have been the first time the girl admitted she knew the schedule. James held his hand out for Rachel\'s pack and held it for her until she slid out and jumped down. Reza was last out. Right before he slammed the back door, he stuck his head back in the car and said, \"Thanks for the ride.\"

Margaret knew he meant thanks for the music, even though that wasn\'t what he said. She hit track 2 on the way back to Healing House and belted out \"like the ceiling can\'t hold us\" when the chorus came around.

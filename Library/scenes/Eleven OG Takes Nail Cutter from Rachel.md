ELEVEN

OLD GIRL WANTED A RAZOR in the worst way. If she had a razor, it would only take a second.

Her new roommate, Rachel, was on her quilt-covered bed, shuffling through a make-up bag. "Damn. I forgot my toenail clippers. Can I borrow yours?" she asked.

Old Girl snorted. "They took those away from me when I got here."

"How do you clip your nails?"

"I don't. They just grow under my feet. They're so long now, I don't need shoes."

Rachel actually laughed at the hoary joke. "If I'd known they'd give me a comedian for a roommate, I wouldn't have made such a stink about coming here."

Old Girl felt the uneasy tug of friendship but she dismissed it as something she couldn't afford. Too bad she wasn't going to be around long enough to tell all her suicide jokes. Not that many people appreciated them.

"Yippee! I didn't forget!" Rachel waved a wicked pair of clippers at her.

Old Girl was amazed. "Didn't they go through your stuff when you got here? That's contraband."

"Toenail cutters?"

"You don't cut your nails and make them bleed? Like every other girl here?"

Rachel shrugged. "Guess I'm just not that creative. Not like you."

"Me?"

"You're always saying something clever. What else would you call yourself?"

Truthful was the word that flashed through Old Girl's brain. Truthful. Not clever. Not funny. "Your standards are pretty low."

Old Girl felt sorry when she caught Rachel's wince. For the millionth time, she regretted her ability to unerringly identify a soft spot and poke it.

Lydia passed the door of their room and flashed them a shit-eating grin. She'd been hogging the bathroom as usual. "Lights out in three minutes," she called. She grinned like the cat that ate the canary and the coke stash too.

"Bitch" Both girls spoke at the same time. Then they laughed.

On the way to the shower room, Old Girl had a flash of inspiration. Cutting nails to the quick wasn't the only thing clippers were good for. "Mind if I borrow your clippers?"

Rachel hesitated.

"I don't have HIV."

"It's not that. It's ..." Rachel leaned one hip against the sink, clenching her fingers like she was trying to grab at something elusive. "I don't know you well enough to watch you hurt yourself."

"I don't know you well enough to off myself in front of you."

Rachel handed over the clippers without another word.

She went about her face washing routine, which looked like it required a rocket science degree to get through all the steps, unlike the splash-and-dash method that Old Girl used.

When Rachel finally toweled off her face, Old Girl made a show of holding up the clippers so Rachel could see her drop them back in her make-up bag. "See. No harm, no foul."

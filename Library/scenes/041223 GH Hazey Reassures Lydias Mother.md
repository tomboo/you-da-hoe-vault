**Hartwig Novel excerpt: Chapter 3, Lydia**

Lydia's itch was the size of Godzilla.

She had been hoping the new arrival at Inner Horizons would be a boy. Actually, a hella-boy with a hella-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed late in the week when a tall, bleary-eyed blond named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her she could only have herbal tea!

James had stuttered through his accountability list during Process Group when Darlene had the lame idea of "welcoming" the new girl with their sins. He confessed to the popcorn-coated ceiling while a flush crept out of his shirt collar and climbed his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school?

James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Lydia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Lydia's experience, which was as wide as she could get, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch and its implacability, they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

She had grown up like a ping-pong ball, constantly shuttling from life with Mom in Cannes or Lamu or London, relieved by longer and longer stays with her Gram and Grandpa in Grosse Point, Michigan. There, she was always pampered and paid attention to like a doll; at Mom's, she was more like a doll's piece of luggage. Nobody was mean to her. It was more like benign neglect. Nobody would abuse a Louis Vuitton traveling case either but they did put it on a shelf and forget about it.

Grandpa (Ben) and Grandma (Audie) hated it when her mom went off for months with a boyfriend soon be a husband and even sooner, an ex-husband, but what they could do about it other than make it easy for Lydia to be dumped in Michigan?

Oddly, it had been in Grosse Point where she was loved and well-looked-after that she'd been introduced to sex by her cousin. She was eleven, way before she'd even gotten her period. She weighed 83 pounds, straight up and down as a stick, and had a mouth full of braces. What 15-year-old David got out of regularly fucking her all summer was a mystery. Maybe it was the terror and the pain that eventually morphed into feeling good, even though she was too horrified and ashamed of herself to admit it.

Thank God, she'd managed to avoid any other "holidays" with David. It never occurred to her to tell anyone what David was doing to her in the garden shed and the maid's closet and in her bed every night. By the time that summer was over, she learned sex was all about power over someone weaker. As her hips and boobs developed, she realized she had power and it gave her great pleasure to use it.

At the moment Rachel dropped like a pile driver into James's lap, Lydia's first thought was *James is mine*!? The girl was jerking and popping like a girl strung out on Angel Dust that Lydia had seen in Times Square on New Year's Eve. *They should have given her the coffee,* flashed through her mind.

Darlene screamed at Lydia to get a towel and Lydia ran to the kitchen and slammed through the utensil and cutlery drawers. What the hell good was a towel? she wondered, until Darlene rolled up the red and white checked dish rag she brought and forced it between Rachel's teeth. "It's to keep her from biting through her tongue," Darlene said.

Lydia perched in Darlene's chair while the seizure shook the poor girl like a rag doll. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary and gruesome Lydia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her then eyes fell on Darlene's bag sitting next to the chair. Her wallet was clearly visible in the opening. Everybody else was tuned into the horror show like all that was missing was the popcorn.

A twenty dollar bill in the wallet called out to her. She'd been trying out the Goth Girl look and here was no way to do Goth or punk without black nails. Mom would have a shit fit if she saw them but Lydia had never stolen a thing in her life. It seemed in bad taste to take something when she had something like \$20 million in her trust fund and that was chump change in the Bronfman family. But how could she face Mom without nail polish remover?

She'd spent the measly \$5 a week the Program gave them on gum. Five dollars! It was like an insult. Just enough to remind you that needed money for everything else.

*You can pay it back* whipped through her like the electrical charge that was zipping around the new girl splayed out on the living room rug like Frankengirl. Lydia's hand was tucking the bill into her pocket before it finished its circuit.

She made the mistake of glancing sideways. Old Girl gave her the stink eye. She never bothered with nail polish. Her nails were broken and ragged or chewed down to the quick with red, angry cuticles.

Everyone at the Program told each they were nuts but Old Girl meant it they day she called her a crazy fuck. Lydia felt plenty small enough; she didn't need to feel smaller when the tiny tyrant that was her mother would be armed with a perfect French manicure and the quirk of a perfectly trimmed eyebrow.

While Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling Rachel up in a blanket, Lydia nudged James from behind, their private signal. Then she slipped into the bathroom off the kitchen.

\# \# \#

The bathroom was colder than a meat locker. Like everything else at Healing House, it was outfitted in faux-homey Shaker decor that leaned to blond oak and breadboarded walls. Even the toilet seat was wood grain.

Lydia climbed into the tub behind the shower curtain that hid an old fashioned claw footed hulk the size of an ice berg. James had better hurry it up or she would shiver herself into an orgasm. Maybe then she could master the itch that swamped her the second she let herself think about meeting with her mother at ten.

She didn't think David had done her any lasting damage. She was too young to get pregnant. The sex-crazed adolescent's solution to birth control: I know, fuck the eleven-year-old!

You could say he had taught her the power of sex. After weeks of fucking her in the garden shed and the maid's closet and against every available wall, the pain had gone away and been replaced by shame that it felt so good.

It was strange. Early on she thought she craved sex for the orgasms that ripped her head off but later she realized that she did it for the orgasms that ripped her *partner's* heads off. That was what she was addicted to. To make someone gasp and squirm and make the veins in their neck stand out or have them quivering for what only she could give in that moment was an out-of-body experience for her. Sometimes she forgot about being in her own body when they were coming right out of theirs.

She never saw David again after that summer. He went off to prep school at Phillips Academy in Andover and she spent the next couple of years in Switzerland when Mom was married to Aldo, one of the Fiats. By the time her boobs and hips developed, she was plenty able to defend herself from the likes of her skinny-ass cousin. At 15, she was fucking anyone who could make her joy buzzer ding.

Who would put a tub next to a kitchen? she wondered. Didn't people in the West get the concept of a powder room? Or was that an East coast thing? There wasn't even a shower head in the little-used bathroom. All the baths with showers were at the ends of the dorm halls. She supposed they'd been added on at some point when they turned an old farm house into a nut house.

Healing House didn't have enough hot water for 12 people, much less enough to take the chill off a cast iron tub the size of a water trough.

Lydia remembered one of the maids telling her to "get in and get out" of the old tub in Grosse Point before David figured out she was taking a bath. The maids were afraid of him and they weren't the ones waiting in dread for 15-year-old David to crawl in bed with her.

Maybe that was why David took her virginity. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. This was perhaps the only kind thought she'd ever had about her cousin. Was this Inner Horizons shit finally working? She dismissed that idea like a bad smell in the room.

If Lydia didn't scratch the itch, she would feel worthless. She would feel like she didn't matter. She would never matter. Only if she can had sex with someone, anyone--- James was here! James was handy!--- would she know she existed. She'd do anything to avoid that feeling of being small and helpless and unable to get away from what was happening to her.

Finally, the door opened and the shower rings jangled like Pavlov's bell.

Lydia climbed up James's body faster than Pavlov's dog got to his bowl. She threw her legs around his waist and James grunted. She couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He was just starting to kiss her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes widened and locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard.

When the door shut, a pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands. He held her away from his body.

"I can't," he said. "Not after all the shit that went down."

Lydia had a moment of empathy with the epileptic girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Lydia was having at being left empty without any flopping or jerking. "You don't have to think! Just feel!" If James didn't get her off before Mom, she was going to fly into a million jagged pieces.

If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she'd have to fill herself up with food and there was no time before Rahel arrived to get to Dunkin' Donuts. She'd been having more and more bulimic episodes because there was no fucking way she'd ever be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. It was a vicious cycle. No fucking for fat girls and yet, she was so empty.

"Chill!" The curtain rings jangled behind James as he pushed them angrily out of the way.

Pavlov's dog had an empty bowl.

**Chapter 4, James POV**

James' parents could afford to throw a brand new Mercedes off a cliff every three months like they did when they wrote the check for his quarterly fees to Inner Horizons. Dad, CEO of a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, and a neurosurgeon, were both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, reminded him in today's therapy session. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked. James' answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

James parents were always asking him why he did what he did. Sometimes he even asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time" was the only answer that made any sense to him.

It didn't seem to him when he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on weed or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka from his dad's liquor cabinet\-- that he had trouble staying on task or that he got easily distracted.

Once in a good moment with Dr. Mom, the neurologist and brain surgeon whom Susan was a clone of, he asked her why he and Susan were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system can talk to your frontal cortext."

He'd looked up the limbic system that he now understood as the lizard brain where all his fears and fuck-ups lived, he assumed. The frontal cortex housed the decision-making parts of his brain.

He commented to his mom when they were having pizza on the way to abasketball game that his frontal cortex must be the size of a walnut." Oh, no, James," she said. "It's the right size. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to your limbic system yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections. "Time," she said, matter-of-factly. "Only time makes the brain connect."

Maybe that's why Susan had a high round forehead. All those connections she was making when she got straight A's in AP classes when he barely got into Cal State with a basketball scholarship. All Susan's connections made her brain bulge out and James' lack of them went to his flat feet.

He refused to think about the hours and hours Susan spent in her room or at the library studying while he was out partying or stoned on weed leaving his homework to get done (or not) in the 10 minutes between class changes. It was just a girl thing that plain and freckled Susan did what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by a flurry of texts and IMs from his pals.  It wasn't like either James or Susan had grown up unloved or neglected. Sure, they had nannies when they were little but Dr. Mom and Dad always made time for them. Dad came to all his basketball games, even when he traveled, and Mom made him videotape James's games if she had a long surgery so she could watch them later. She complained bitterly about Dad's shitty camera work so she must have watched quite a lot.

James just seemed unable to stop himself from any shiny thing that called out to him. A party tonight in the Canyon? Susan would say, "I have to study for my Calc test" and James would be texting A3. Anytime, anywhere, any place.

One of the stupid family stories Dad loved to tell was about the day he had to leave a board meeting because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to preschool and James and the Schwarzenegger kid are having PB&J sandwiches and grape juice," Dad would say. "There's the Schwarzenegger with his arm around James, drinking out of the same glass." Then Maria Shriver calls up and says James left a perfect bite mark on her kid's left buttock.

"'I told James to bite his tongue next time,'" Dad would say. "Or at least wait till after the board meeting." As if James could control his urge to strike out which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. There was no planning involved. The impulse came and he bit down.

It was only later, like the moment he stared at the crazy pattern in the safety glass of his shattered windshield, that he realized it wasn't as fun as it had promised.

"What the shit?" he cried when the new girl whose name he'd forgotten landed in his lap. Her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at the blond girl's face upside down. Her pupils were rolled up like a window shade, white and mapped with tiny red capillaries you couldn't follow.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get Bruce!" she shouted. Then, pointing at Lydia, she shouted, "Call 9-1-1!"

Half sprawled on James and half on the carpet, the girl began flopping like a carp. Everybody in Process Group perched on the edge of their seats watching her as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between thankfulness that the seizure put an end to the accountability bull shit and truly appalled at the sight of Bruce, the burly van driver, kneeling on the girl's elbows while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James laid his hands on her thin, long legs and he felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if she were being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, while James held on with all of his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying-on of hands on a person seized by electricity, impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. The girl's body had a will and an agenda all its own. He glanced at Lydia and tried to catch her eye, wondering if the bodily high-jacking shook her as much as it shook him. She was plucking something out of Darlene's purse and wasn't even tuned into girl's seizure.

After a bone jarring shiver that started at her head and rolled through the girl's body the way a dog shook off water, her eyes -- a bruise-darkened blue -- popped open. She glanced around the cluster of unfamiliar faces and James had the impression she was thinking she'd woken up in hell. Consciousness spread slowly over her face, followed by a deep blush of shame. The monster is out of the closet, James read, and it is me.

"Are you OK?" Darlene asked her. James squeezed her hand, feeling fingers thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then catching his eye, dropped his hand as if she'd been burned.

Darlene and Bruce decided to load her into the Suburban and take her in to Kootenai Hospital. It was 20 miles away but it would be faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Gretchen, the Dietician, in charge. At least Gretchen wouldn't be touching food while she was busy supervising the group they left behind. James couldn't understand how even her carrot sticks tasted weird.

By then, Process Group was officially toast.

Everybody replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Lydia, to whom everything always came around to sex, said she thought the new girl fell in James' lap because she was trying to give James a blow job. "I thought I'd have to fight her off," she said. Reza, his motormouth room mate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants. "Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

"They must have known she was epileptic!" Old Girl was pissed off. "What the fuck's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than let her rip him a new asshole with her razor tongue. The girl was pretty scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. She had an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he'd was more familiar with at bottom of a tequila bottle. He surprised himself by saying, "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

Paul, the mammoth Aspbergery math wizard, who never ever said a word, actually spoke. "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like a ghost was speaking.

"What are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

Everybody laughed. Paul went back to doodling equations on the back of his hand.

Lydia bumped James from behind, the sign she had to have sex right now. How could she even think about sex when he was shaken to the core?

Chapter 5, Dr. Hazey POV

After his ex-wife, Alma left Dr. Aloysius Hazey, he often sat in his office staring out at Lake Coeur D'Alene as it froze over. He found it impossible to do anything productive. A stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical health care premiums needed to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the earnest but dour head therapist, remained unread and unsigned.

He checked the clock again. Another hour before he could reasonably down a second muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck, for his session with Old Girl.

He'd just finished a horrible progress meeting with Rahel Bronfman nee--- Hunt-something. Hunter? Huntsman? The woman had remarried and divorced twice the year since Lydia came to the program and he couldn't remember her new last name.

His job was to assure Rahel Hunts-a-Lot about Lydia's progress which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. She had six more write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct.

Her entire file was stuffed with the carefully coded phrases of dysfunction: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (I.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening but still nascent (keeping her under lock-and-key was working when she didn't escape). "

What Dr. Hazey could say definitively about Lydia Bronfman was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were always on time.

Parents like Lydia's mother wanted to meet with Dr Hazey, the Founder of Inner Horizons, to be reassured. He'd tried fruitlessly to pass this duty off to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene but she had no idea how to be reassuring. She had a problem with brutal honesty. Parents would meet with Darlene, of the dour and untrusting personality, and there went another monthly fee transferred away to the new Anorexia Unit at McLain or Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu. God, it was a dog-eat-dog- in the depression-and- anxieties-world.

Hazey's trick was to hit the right balance between avuncular reassurement while avoiding the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact, almost every adolescent he'd ever met had a common predilection for sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

Rahel Bronfman HUNT turned out to be was a martially thin, dark-haired woman. A perfect clone of her daughter or, he supposed, vice versa. Lydia was also tiny but rounded in that still childlike way while her mother was tight and lean without an ounce of softness. Calves like knots rose above excellent ankles and her hips were narrow as an adolescents. Lydia's mother worked out harder than the Marines.

Rahel's first question was whether her daughter was gaining any weight. "She has a tendency to fat, like I do." The hip she patted was as flat as a coyote. It was not hard to see where Lydia got her obsession with food, though the woman was

attractive in a feral, hungry way. When she laid a hand on his arm---he'd made the mistake of sitting with her on the couch---he felt like a cream puff awaiting very sharp teeth. "Help my little girl," the mother said in a throaty voice. "Lydia's all I have."

He tried to probe why Rahel didn't call in during Lydia's weekly family therapy. Her answer: "I've been out of the country" as if cell phones and WhatsApp hadn't been invented.

"Kids feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their well-being" he said gently.

"I'm a good mother!" she barked. "What did she say about me?"

Hazey s deflected the danger by saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfman---your father?--- is the father figure in Lydia's life." The lifelong issue between absent mother and angry daughter wasn't going to get solved in a 45-minute fly-by. "Lydia is happy you are here," he said. "Just don't be surprised if she acts out."

"Of course," Rahel murmured, patting his hand with an assessing air as if she was feeling a piece of meat she wanted to snap up.

Thank the lucky stars Darlene had been able to convince Lydia to meet with her mother, even though it had taken a marathon of extra therapy sessions and some bribery because Lydia wanted to take classes at NICC, though she was nowhere near ready for a pass out in the free world.

Rahel's spike heels against the wood floor jackhammered at Hazey's overloaded brain with ungodly noise. God, he needed that muscle relaxant that was calling to him from his pocket. He absolutely couldn't, Hazey told himself. He had to control himself until the woman got back on her Learjet in two hours. Then and only then could the pill come out to play in a splash of Bombay and tonic.

Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, Old Girl was one of his few regular patients. He'd had to drop all his other long term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of the administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections, things he loathed?

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep her on his crowded schedule though it was hell to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include Angela Livengood. She made him laugh. She continually surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. And if he didn't get through to her, he was deathly afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to get through to Old Girl's depression and suicide ideation. Suicide had been so much of part of her, life he couldn't seem to jolt her out of her rut. It was like she'd been on the path to her own distruction for so long that the dirt walls had built up over her head while the path she walked cut deep into granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair she could barely see the stars above her.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit. He was also lazy. He was unproductive. He wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for pick-me-up before his session with Old Girl.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. And he couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a beautiful young woman would wear those dry cardboard scraps mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with nine weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her sexuality and she buried it in matted hair that looked like dessicated Medusa snakes.

Didn't she want a boy friend? Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horions from becoming a bed-hopping swap fest. But he would make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way than sex with one of her peers? That boy from Malibu---John? Justin? Jamison?---he was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing a woman with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a reason for the No Fishing Off the Company Dock rules. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at NICC now that she had graduated to taking classes after a year in Intensive. If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe, Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought. The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the drugs.

090918 OG meets Chase while sick

OG got the strep throat that was going around.

She'd been sleeping all morning until a ring-bring-bring drug her up from deep sleep like an alarm. But what was there to be alarmed about? Just make it stop and let me die in bed with my head under the covers.

It went on for what seemed like an hour, until she finally drug herself out of bed and went to the front door in her feverish state. She was hot, really burning up in her flannel nightgown. Everybody else was at school or community service or therapy. Margaret, on morning duty, was nowhere in sight. The last time OG had seen her she was complaining to Gretchen about how the raccoons had knocked over the garbage can.

Two escorts were at the door. They supported a pale, nervous kid between them who looked like he hadn't slept in a week. She installed all three of them in the living room. Then she went looking for Margaret to get them off her hands.

The kid, black haired, wearing an ash gray ski jacket that's a shade lighter than his face, followed her into the kitchen. He asked her what kind of place this was.

"Is this hell or am I in'." The old line from an AP class on Paradise Lost somehow came to mind and she was surprised to find it on her lips. The old life intruding in the new.

Might as well be truthful, she thought. Why pretend this isn't lock-down, that there's no cell phone service, no TV and no iPhone games. With his pale skin and twitchy movements, she could see that the stranger felt like she did, like living shit, but he was so young , he could probably shake it off with a couple of Excedrin and some cold water on his face. Next to his long, Gallic nose, a white head sprouted like pale, perfect mushroom in miniature. She knew she shouldn't stare but should she tell him about it? Offer a dose of acne medicine as her Christian duty. It was so rare for them to reach that perfect moment of popping, wasn't it worse to let it go to waste?

When Margaret said she would handle it from here, all OG could think of on her listing walk back to her room was the whitehead that was ready to pop. That crude excrescence of life and hormones and likely too many Cheeze-Its along with whatever witches brew of drugs he was on.

The raccoon scrabbled high up a ponderosa tree. It watched the coyote sniff at the dark thing on the ground. Whatever the dark thing carried, it smelled good from forty feet above it, but not as good as the olfactory bouquet that the coyote was taking in. It was better than that weird patch on the alpha's tail which oozed a trail of color not found in nature wherever she went.

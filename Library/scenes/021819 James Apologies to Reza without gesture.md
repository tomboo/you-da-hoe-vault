021819 James Apologies to Reza without gesture

JAMES WAS WORKING ON HIS IMPACT LETTER AGAIN while Reza was supposedly working on his too.

Reza had been uncharacteristically quiet since the stabbing. A sigh whuffled out of him from his single bed across the room every few minutes. An unsettled wind. After ten minutes, he abandoned his writing entirely in favor of picking at the bandage wrapped around his hand. He kept unwinding and rewinding the gauze until it wouldn't stay tucked.

"Would you do this for me?" Reza said. "It's driving me crazy."

"Hey, write your own accountability crap. I've got enough problems with my own," said James.

"Not my letter. Help me with the bandage. It keeps unraveling."

James got up from his desk and sat down on the corner of the mattress where Reza was writing, propped up by his pillows. Reza scooted closer to the wall and James unwrapped the gauze which was wrinkled and grimy from Reza playing with it.

"Jesus, this is a mess. Quit looking at it or your hand'll get infected."

"Want to see it?" Reza. Any carbuncle in a storm.

"Not really."

Reza's face fell, until James relented. "Okay, fine. It'll be easier if we start all over."

When released from the gauze and the ointment laden packing, Reza's hand looked like raw meat. The skin was red. The dark tine marks looked like fang marks except there were three puncture wounds, not two. The area around the punctures, swollen and puffy.

James touched Reza's skin gently with one finger. "Does that hurt?"

"Like a bitch."

"She really nailed you."

Reza turned his hand over and James was amazed to see that the fang marks were reproduced on his palm like stigmata from a very weird snake. "Man. The fork went all the way through."

"Good thing she's not any bigger or she would have nailed me to the floor, instead of the table," Reza said.

James reapplied the antibiotic on the packing, making sure he didn't touch the wound. Soon, he had the gauze nicely straightened with no wrinkles. He rewrapped it, carefully, then reset the butterfly clip so it held tight and kept the bacteria out. "Now quit fucking with it. I wrapped it tighter so the pressure should make it feel better."

"How do you know how to do that?"

"Mom's a doc." James couldn't count the number of times he'd been wrapped expertly from his childhood scrapes by her neat surgeon's hands.

"Are you going to be a doc?"

"Oh, hell no." James had no idea what he was going to be if he ever grew up, but the mountain his mother had climbed was an unattainable heigh. "I barely got into USC. Med school would be ridiculous."

Reza sighed again, a sad windy sound. "I know what you mean. My dad thinks I'm going to get into Harvard and be an economist like him.

"Parents," they both said at once, as if united in the opinion that sharing genetics turned people insane.

"Hey," James said, into the pause. "I'm, ah... sorry for the other night."

"For what?"

"... he night you got stabbed?" This was harder than Josh had made it sound. "That thing I said? ... you know? When I called you 'Monkey Boy'? Remember?"

Reza took a deep breath, a technique Josh was always trying to teach James to use so he could "self-calm" before he acted.

"Yeah, I remember," Reza admitted grimly. "Monkey Boy's not the worst of it. What about Shit-for-Brains? You know, I figured out how to make meth without blowing my brains out. I'm not stupid."

James opened his mouth, closed it. Like a fish.

"I don't remember saying that."

"How about Midget, do you remember that? Or Gnat Boy? Mosquito? 'Talks A Lot But Says Nothing?' Midget? Motormouth? Gnat? Dork-o? Dingbat? Dweeb? Ratso? Rizzo? Ditzoid? Do you remember those?"

James face went hot, then super-heated as the list went on. "I guess... I do it a lot. Call you names, I mean."

"And Apu! I fucking hate Apu the most!"

Like all arguments, there was one moment when they were talking rationally and then the instant when rationality lifted off to Def Con 5. James noticed with the mention of 'Apu', Reza's whole body started quivering like he was going to speak in tongues. This was Reza, for God's sake, not Gandhi.

"Once, you even called me Gandhi! How many times do I have to tell you I'm not Indian, I'm Pakistani?"

"Gandhi was a saint," James said, rather diffidently.

"A Hindu saint, maybe. Not to Muslims."

"I don't understand...."

"After all that other shit you called me, why apologize for Monkey Boy? Did you wake up in the middle of the night and convert yourself from asshole to Shiva H. Vishnu?" Reza on a roll, was Reza on a tear.

"Why now?" Reza, on the high road and enjoying it, repeated. "What brought on the Gandhi act to the lowly Muslim?" 

James said, without thinking, "Josh told me to."

"Oh!" Reza cried out triumphantly like he'd found a \$100 bill in a pile of dog turds. "Josh told you to. Did he also tell you to quit calling me 'Apu' because it's racist?"

Unsure how to extricate himself from this deepening circle of hell, James nodded.

"Let me ask you. Would you ever call Josh Apu? Or Monkey Boy?"

James shook his head in the negative. "You know he outweighs me by forty pounds."

"And you outweigh me by forty pounds." Reza gestured to the small space between Reza, practically flattened in the tiny corner to keep from touching him,

and James who seemed to loom over him on the single bed.

The weight difference was more like sixty pounds but James wasn't about to correct him.

"My point exactly. You don't expect me to fight back because I'm small and brown. Jesus, James, you're the clueless one. 'Apu' is a sterotype. Some white guy who doesn't know anything about S. Asians made him up and now every clueless white guy in America calls every brown guy with an accent an Indian who runs a Korean grocery store! I'm a Paki and I'd rather be called that than fucking Apu because at least it's correct!"

If Reza was a bomb, this was the moment of the final 'tock.' Reza suddenly eeled himself off the bed like a magician, making absolutely sure to not touch any part of James's body. An image of Reza's favorite, Dr. Pushwill, came to James like an revenant. Careful where you aim that thing, he heard the good doctor say.

In the door way, stiff and outraged in a state of righteous dignity, Reza said, "Take your apology, White Boy, and shove it where the sun don't shine."

"And let's not forget Apu. App has to be your number one favorite."

"I really wanted to say I was sorry...," James started again, but Reza didn't let him finish.

"You *wanted* to say you *were* sorry." Reza emphasized the tense, willfully changing the present to the past, which wasn't what James meant at all. "Does that mean you were sorry then but you're not sorry now?"

"No, stupid." He stopped, wishing he could take back all the names, starting with stupid. He cleared his throat. Said "I meant I *am* sorry" with a raised voice, in an effort to make himself understood. The loudness of his deep voice int he quiet room seemed to have the effect of making Reza flinch deeper in the corner. He couldn't be afraid of James, could he? All he was doing was sitting on his mattress.

"Why do you always call me names?" Reza asked. " What's wrong with plain old Reza?"

James blinked. "I... uhm.... I didn't think..."

Reza pounced. "That's your problem. You never think about what you say and how it makes me feel. I call you James every damn day and what do you call me? Stink Bug. I shower just as much as you do!"

"I know that." James passed a hand over his lower jaw where the blond hairs were just beginning to stubble. Reza's dark beard was way ahead of James, he noticed. The one place Reza had James beat. He had to shave twice a day to get rid of it.

"You think everything you say is funny, don't you? Stink Bug always gets a big laugh, so you say it again. People laughed when you called me "Monkey Boy," didn't they?"

Another pass over James's paltry stubble. "I don't know," he muttered. "Estie stabbed you then and you were screaming so loud, I didn't hear it."

Reza was now inspecting his wrapped hand like it was some wounded creature. He cradled it protectively in his lap. "And don't even get me started on 'Apu'! You call me Apu all the time. That's worse. I'm not even Indian."

Hard didn't come close to it. James was officially eating glass. "Yeah, Josh told me I should apologize for that, too."

"Oh, so you're apologizing because Josh said to? That's sucks even worse."

"I was just kidding."

"Not funny.""You said you love the Simpson! How funny Apu is. How he makes you laugh."

"Apu is a stereotype made up by some white guy about people he doesn't know one thing about. Everybody thinks all South Asians run Korean grocery stores. I'm not going to Harvard but I'm not doing that!"

James cleared his throat.

"Jesus, James. You were there when those assholes yelled at me to go home. What, did you forget? Or didn't you notice?"

Weeks before, James and Reza were walking down Main Street in Coeur d'Alene when some dudes in a pick-up drove by and shouted racial slurs. Reza didn't realize the rednecks were aiming their catcalls at him.

"Doesn't that make you mad?" James had asked.

"What?" Reza was entertaining himself by doing what he called writing music on the inside of his eyeballs. James could tell by the rhythmic tapping and snapping of his fingers and the four-four time he kept with his feet.

"Didn't you hear those assholes shout at you?"

"No. What'd they want?"

"They called you..." James hesitated. "...the 'N' word."

"A noodge? That's better than being called a Paki. "

James shook his head. The only people who still called people "noodges" were either ten-years-old or a hundred. "They called you a nigger, Reza."

"Really? "In London, they would have called me a bloody mop head." Reza had lived in Great Britain until he was twelve, when his dad got a promotion and moved the family to New Jersey. " I guess I've moved up in the world.They don't know what to call me in Idaho. I'm not a Spic. Not a Jap. Not a Chink . Not even a stinking Injun which is a step below everything else, right?"

James nodded. " Worse, think."

"Hmmm," Reza said. "At least they didn't call me bowlegged. I hate that."

James thought for perhaps the first time, what a trial it was to be Reza. Not black. Not white. Not anything in know-nothing Idaho except small, strange, suspect, and on top of everything else, clueless.

The truck drove around again the block again. One of the older guys, the one waving the Confederate flag in the truck bed, shouted. "Go back where you came from."

"I'd rather go back to Britain than New Jersey. At least they know what to call me."

The driver flipped them off and shouted, "Go home you fucking monkey!"

"Monkey," James rolled his eyes. "That's clever."

"Better than Shivu H. Vishnu," Reza said. "Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain."

"is that in the Koran?"

"I don't know. I thought you were Christian."

"I am. But that doesn't mean I read the Bible."

"I don't read the Koran either so I guess we're even."

They crossed the street then, making sure the truck didn't coming around again to run them over. James had asked Reza, "Does that happen to you a lot?"

"Once in a while," he had said.

Back in the quiet dorm room, James swallowed down whatever was in his throat and asked, "Would it be better if I called you Brown Boy?"

"It would be if you were brown," Reza said. "It's OK when my friends say it because they're brown too."

"Sorry. Wrong genes. We're Scandinavian or something."

"Why don't you leave color out of it? Actually, why don't you leave 'boy' out of it, too?"

"You mean, like, call you by your name?"

"That would be novel," Reza said. "I call you James.

"So call me Olson. That's what the guys on the team call me. I don't even know your last name. What is it anyway?"

"You'll never be able to spell it. It's Kamaaliaazaad. With seven As. And that's not even a record in Urdu."

"Are you fucking with me?"

"Always. But that's my name."

Reza took a page out of his notebook and wrote it down across an entire line. James counted out the syllables. "So, Reza." He gestured to the name. "Monkey Boy is easier than that."

"Try Monkey Boy on Josh and see what he says."  "You know he outweighs me by 40 pounds."

"My point, exactly. It's an insult, you dumbass."

Reza's face was walled off. He suddenly eeled off the bed, squeezing through the small space between the headboard on the single bed and the dip in the mattress where James was sitting. It was like a Houdini maneuver, the way Reza was able to slip suddenly sideways, and push himself out of proximity to James, as if James' was ountouchable.

At the door, he stood upright and stiff, his small brown body like a plank, and said coldly, "Thanks for the wrap job, White Boy. Not the apology."

Hoooboy.

Both both started at a knock on their door. Tap-tap- ppppauuuuuse-RAP.

Reza opened it. Big Paul hulked on the other side.

James, expecting Big Paul to want to play cards with him, was thinking cards were far preferable to the sour smell in the room of the failed apology. But Paul said to Reza, "Hey, I wrote a new song. Want to hear it?"

Since when did Paul sing? The big autistic kid barely opened his mouth except to eat.

"I wrote one too," Reza scrabbled around in his backpack and pulled out a messy piece of paper with wandering lines of notes among trebles and bass clefs.

"I thought you just wrote on the back of your eyeballs," James said to his roommate.

"My eyelids, not my eyeballs!" Reza snorted. "I work out my music with my eyes closed. Then I write it down so I remember it."

Reza gave James the finger like an ironic salute.

Staring at the blank wood, James listened to Reza asking Paul what key he was working in through the door. In his mind's eye, James was seeing Josh's pink hands spread in defeat at the end of the family call when James had hung up on Mom and Dad. The dial tone was still sounding in their ears when Josh said to James, "That went well." Apology extended. Not accepted. Reza off to pal around with the one guy in the Program who never spoke. There were no musical instruments at Healing House, so it was hard to imagine how those two were going to share the music they had written. Could Paul play Reza's music on the back of his eyelids? Would they swap? Why did that make James feel so alone?

Reza in his tight whites and undershirt looked undersized and slightly bow legged. His brown hairy legs were wide-set on his hips so he walked like a South Asian cowboy, slopping along in running shoes that he had walked down at the heel like slippers. If he weighed more than 120 pounds, James would have been surprised.

"Didn't your mother feed you enough," he asked suddenly. "You look like you were starving at one time."

Reza blinked. "My dad's a managing partner at Goldman Sachs. My mother would die if she heard you say that. I've always had plenty to eat."

"You're pretty...". James wanted to say 'underfed' but settled on "...skinny."

"I'm vegetarian," Reza said, like James was a dope. "We don't eat meat. Pakistani people aren't pig-fat like Americans." He gestured toward James as if he was lumping him into all the overweight people they'd seen at Walmart buying huge bags of Cheetohs and chips.

"Sorreee," James muttered. This cultural sensitivity stuff was more trying than it looked.

"Look on my bright side, James," Reza said, a minute later.

"Why?"

"When you're fifty, you've weigh over 250 pounds and I'll still be able to wear the same clothes."

"Oh good," James said, thinking that'll be the day. Judging from Reza's expression, he was thinking the same exact thing. It would be decades before they both realized they were wrong and by then, they wouldn't remember.

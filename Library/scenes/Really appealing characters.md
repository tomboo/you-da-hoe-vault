Really appealing characters

An errand. To pick up flowers for the dinner. She's expecting something, looking ahead to prepare for a tense social interchange. That propels her to think about needing flowers Which propels her to needing the diamond and tells the story of Patrick saying "This woman needs a great big diamond." Then she's tunneling backward to how Louise met Patrick in the ER after the horrific crash. She's moving forward in time while her mind goes back words and sideways and excursions, but she's still moving forward in her day.

Rachel has to go see Dr. Lengel on campus. She's dreading it because of the wacky encounter with James. She has to pick up shampoo and deodorant at the bookstore. Or maybe she has to replace a textbook that somebody stole. There's a thief in the house -- Ipods, books, clothing --

If she hurried, she could meet with Dr. Lengel and pick up another copy of *Huck Finn* at the bookstore before she had to meet the van. Somebody had stolen her *Huck*. A steady slippage of Ipods and deodorants and shampoo and pieces of clothing had been going MIA with the regularity of a metronome. Rachel had just lost her favorite sweater, a birthday present from her Gran. It was one of the few times the old woman had given her a present that she actually wanted. Gran, a minute seventy-year-old with the energy of a coiled spring, haunted garage sales (her idea of entertainment) and was always giving Rachel an endless series of antique teacups. All with a story of their maker and their age and how valuable they were. She knew because "she looked it up in the book," an ancient dog-eared Bible of antique china that she always carried with her in an enormous alligator purse.

*Miss Lucy had a baby.\
His name was Tiny Tim.\
She put him in the bathtub\
To see if he could swim.\
He drank up all the water.\
He ate up all the soap.\
He tried to eat the bathtub,\
But it wouldn\'t go down his throat.\
Miss Lucy called the doctor.\
Miss Lucy called the nurse.\
Miss Lucy called the lady\
With the alligator purse.*

Gran's bag was big enough to stick Tiny Tim and the bathtub in and carry him off. That's what had happened (at Gran's and Mom's direction) after Rachel gave birth. A nurse had laid the tiny red wrinkly boy on her chest after 28 hours of hard labor and she dozed off feeling his bird weight and when she opened her eyes, he was gone. Could you *lose* a baby? Apparently. Technically, he had been taken away from her "for her own good"---she was only 16 when she got pregnant \--but she always thought of the tiny boy as lost, as in "I've misplaced him" which gave her the feeling that if a miracle happened, he would be found again.

Originally they had agreed to let her keep him \--that's what she wanted. But Gran and Mom both ganged up on her in her last month of pregnancy. "You're too young." "You're not ready for the responsibility." "It'll ruin your life before it's even started." They were right about that. They took her out of St. Edwards High (the Catholics didn't want a burgeoning bad apple in their midst) and she lost all her friends and walked around like a fatter and fatter ghost at the alternative school for stoners and losers. Her brother pretended like he didn't know her, and all her aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews stopped talking to her as if pregnancy was some kind of plague. Then Gran and Mom told her they wouldn't lift a finger for her if she kept him. She'd be out on the street at sixteen, no job skills, no degree, unable to buy diapers or baby food. "You'll both starve."

There were worse things than starving, they found out. After having the baby, she went down a rabbit hole but unlike Alice, she never came around. All she did was tumble farther, faster and deeper into darkness. The only thing that brought her toward the light \--and that was only temporary -- was cutting.

*\"Mumps,\" said the doctor.\
\"Measles,\" said the nurse.\
\"Razor,\" said the lady\
With the alligator purse.*

Cutting was the only time she felt alive. So she brought back the birth pangs by slicing her armpits and the bottoms of her feet and the insides of her thighs with a salted razor. Until one day, two months ago, she couldn't stop and she opened the arteries of both wrists down to bone. Welcome to Healing House.

*Out went the doctor.\
Out went the nurse.\
Out went the lady\
With the alligator purse.*

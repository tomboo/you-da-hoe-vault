062515 Lydia on the power of sex

Her mother would quirk one impeccably plucked eyebrow at her. "Aren't you trying a little hard to stand out?"

She didn't think David had done any lasting damage. Too young to get pregnant---the sex-crazed adolescent's solution to birth control. I know, fuck the eleven-year-old!

After the initial feeling of being torn apart from the inside out, he'd raised horrible feelings of shame. After fucking her in every closet and garden shed and nightly in her bed for weeks, the pain had morphed from bad to weird and unpleasant into feeling good.

You could say he taught her the power of sex. After weeks of fucking her in the garden shed and the maid's closet and against every available wall, the pain had gone away and been replaced by shame that it felt so good.

She never saw her cousin again after that summer. He went off to prep school and Phillips Academy in Andover and she spent the next couple of years in Switzerland when Mom was married to Aldo, one of the Fiat's, and by the time her boobs and hips developed, she was plenty able to defend herself from the likes of David. By the time she hit 15, she was fucking anyone who could make her joy buzzer ding.

How could you not crave sex when it gave you so much power? It was strange. Early on she thought she did it for the orgasms that ripped her head off but later she realized that she did it for the orgasms that ripped her partners heads off. That was what she was addicted to. To make someone gasp and squirm and make the veins in their neck stand out or have them quivering for what only she could give in that moment was an out-of-body experience for her. A lot of times she forgot about being in her own body when they were coming right out of theirs.

That feeling of being able to make them do anything in the moment. Bark like a dog. Beg and quiver and squirm. Be completely incontrovertibly under her spell. That was the real attraction. It was the itch she absolutely, positively had to scratch.

If Lydia doesn't get what she wants, she feels horrible shame and weakness. She feels like she doesn't matter. She'll never matter. Only if she can have sex with someone, anyone, right now will she know she exists. She'll do anything to avoid that feeling of being small and helpless and unable to get away from the pain.

Lydia put the memories of David away in a black box. As far as she was concerned they were as far away from Grosse Point, Michigan, where she now lived with her grandparents---well, until the sentence to Bumfuck, Idaho---as his prep school was at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.

Lydia put the memories of David u on a high shelf as distant as Grosse Point, Michigan, where she now lived, was from Phillips Academy at Andover where David was presumably fucking other people smaller than he was. The Bronfman family was big on shipping people off. Maybe that's why their liquor empire did so well. Anything troublesome just got shipped out of sight with the idea that when they came back, things would be different.

Where in hell was James? The bathroom was like being shipped off to the Antarctic.

Lydia had been having more and more bulimic episodes. Her orthodontist ratted her out to Grandpa Ben because the backsides of her teeth were pitted and rutted with acid from all her puking. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food but there was no fucking way she'd ever be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. It was a vicious cycle. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was so empty.

In a way, though she hadn't thought of it till now, fucking her brains out for a few minutes lasted about as long as it took to eat a dozen donuts. Then you threw them up and you were empty and clean as snow.

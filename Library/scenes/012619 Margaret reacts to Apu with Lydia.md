She guessed it had to somewhere to the east since there was an ocean on one side of the long ice cream cone shape of the land mass. Whatever. If it hurt Reza's feelings, that was enough for her.

"Quit it," she said to Lydia, laying down the law based on what she knew in her heart, not in her head. "It hurts his feelings and it makes him feel bad. It's not funny unless he thinks it's funny."

Then, like the mimic she was, she said, experimentally, "Shiva H. Vishnu. Shut up about it." Shiva H. Vishnu had a nice round sound and the added attraction of not being cuss words which she was always getting in trouble for.

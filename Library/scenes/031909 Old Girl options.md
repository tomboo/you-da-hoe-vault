031909 Old Girl options

Issues I want to address:

1.  **Story is too long**

I can savagely cut and compress

I can make it into a novella of 20,000 words and figure out what to do with it later

**2.. Who is the main character?**

I know the main character is Old Girl. In its present alternating voice form, it's easy to get pulled into the other characters' stories so the reader doesn't know what I know.

I can shorten the story by either dropping the alternate voices or compressing them: use the strategy of giving O.G. more space which is a directive to the reader, 'look here'.

I can make the story solely old Girl's, eliminate the other voices but what I like is the alternating views that give the reader the same elements through different eyes with different conclusions.

Writing longer, alternating voices, seems easiest. Probably easier to generate than to tighten, my eternal problem.

**3. Another issue is how the ending crashes onto the reader**. I have foreshadowed her suicidal impulses but I could do more with her depression and do more back story writing to fill in her struggle and make it clear why, in her mind, it's easier to give it up than to go on.

An easy to-do is to create a mss with only old Girl's story and read it for continuity and impact. Maybe I need to add another Old Girl segment like Family Therapy call or even Treatment Team Discussion from the POV of the treatment team. Yippee, omniscient voice!

I could rewrite the Rachel, James and Leia segments to do more with old Girl. I have gotten into each of their solipsistic heads and concentrated on their problems, not on the problems of others, True to life. But I could do more from each person's P0V on what they think of old Girl.

121918 Smells to add to Idaho scenes

Lydia's walk when she is numb and off-kilter. She is shocked by the copper-penny smell of blood, perhaps the only sense that Jed hasn't fucked up in her.

OG smells Rusty's blood but it's mostly garbage that assaults her senses. It's a sweet-ish smell, partly rotted, partly ripe, partly unwashed with tinges of sweat and body funk and French fry oil gone rancid. It seems to be coming from an old blanket that covers a ripped, erupting seat.

Estie smells like thorazine.

Hazey can smell himself, last night's gin sweating out of his pores.

The boys are always farting. Or talking about farting.

The girls pretend farts don't exist.

Lydia can smell sex a mile away and usually it's a lot closer than that.

Gretchen smells of cigarettes and cough drops because she has a

universal scratch in her throat.

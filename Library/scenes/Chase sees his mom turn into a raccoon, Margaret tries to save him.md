A BIG-ASSED WOMAN IN A GRAY sweatshirt that read "Don't Mess with Mom" met Chase Mortimer at the door. It looked like an ordinary ranch house.

"Margaret, here," she said. "And you \-- you're the newest addition to Healing House?" To Chase's ears, the question sounded ironic. Like she was telling him he'd just won the Lottery but she was going to keep the winnings.

Thankfully, he'd managed to stash a last snort of cocaine beneath the insole of his Nikes. So when Margaret left him in the homey living room to get some forms, Chase repaired to the powder room with the big weird cast-iron tub.

Nineteen hours before, two unsmiling men with matching NRA tiepins, had dragooned him away from his dorm in Middlebury, Vermont. He was at the end of a three-day drug and booze fest that had been preceded by months of an upsy-down-daisy-chain of wake-up amphetamines and go-to-sleep downers i.e. freshman year at Bard College as he was enjoying it.

Matthias, the wiry, tense escort with the long face, had strip-searched Chase down to his socks and underwear while Aldus, the fat one who popped Mentos like a chain smoker, packed his duffle bag with ruthless efficiency. Neither escort had the courage to stick a nose into Chases' running shoes; hence the heartfelt Hallelujah Chorus Chase was able to hum as he shook out a thin line of white powder on the powder room counter.

Chase bent to the line the way a man dying of hunger bends to an all-u-can-eat buffet. He Hoovered up a sustaining snort and then paused, regretting that this was the last of his stash, not wanting to think too hard about how the hell he was going to replace it in the middle of fucked-up Idaho where his fucking parents had locked him up at a fucking psychiatric treatment program designed to keep him from fucking around.

The drug fiesta had been draining out of his blood stream for the past couple of hours. He needed the white line not so much as to get high but to stay as-is, I.E., able to maintain.

A movement beyond the small square window in the bathroom interrupted Chase's next snort.

A furry, feral creature with a black mask stared at him through the glass with a look of disapproval. Chase's heart rate was already rocketing---this was good New Jersey shit he'd just snorted from his insole. He\'d stolen it from his dealer before the stingy shit had a chance to cut it. What? Chase wanted to ask the masked fur ball. What do you know that I don't?

The creature had a gray neck ruff. Black bands circled its body. A bushy black-and-white striped tail floated behind its raised back like a warning flag. It faced him at eye level, a yellow grapefruit perched like a beanie on its head.

Chase had only snorted a tiny squiff.

Three quarters of the line remained.

One part of his brain registered judgment in black beady eyes. The rest of his brain took in the tilted black ear, the pointy muzzle, and gray elf-size fingers holding up the grapefruit rind to Chase like a chalice.

The raccoon looked so much like Chase's mother, his heart started and stuttered in quick-time. For an instant, he wondered if perhaps it was a good thing he was in Idaho at a treatment center if he was going to be visited by his grapefruit-eating mother who seemed to have changed herself from a New Jersey socialite into a raccoon. The sight of a fat snarling d looming behind the grapefruit eater pushed aside this image and replaced it with a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth.

The fat coon yowled. A high pitched sound that reminded him of the fight he'd witnessed in Times Square between two 'hos over a john. A moil of striped fur and white-and-black tails and slashing claws turned into a hellish circle of fur and teeth.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Loud raps shook the hollow powder room door. "Yo!\"You OK in there? Need any help?" A woman's voice seemed to occupy the space.

Chase sneezed through his abused sinuses, dimly registering the spray of red mist that dotted the oak counter top like a rash. It felt like he'd been snorting sand in his lungs for a week.

"Uhhhh..." He paused, struggling to quell his rabbiting heart. "Is it possible.... Is there maybe a cat fight near by?"

Chase heard a woman suck in a deep indignant breath. The name 'Margaret' came to Chase from a long distance away. "Son of a bitch!" she cried. "The little motherfuckers!"

Chase got himself out of the bathroom with difficulty. He wandered into a living room, adjoined by a dining room. Peeked down a long hall of closed doors. He was expecting the big woman who'd greeted him to get up in his grill about how long he'd been in the john. Strangely, she was missing. The living area, where he settled on one of too many couches, was empty. Silent as a church.

Chase watched through the big picture window as half a dozen raccoons milled around a mess of overturned garbage cans in the driveway. He tried unsuccessfully to shake off the feeling that his heart was going to carry off his body. He was aware that raccoons were a normal phenomenon in the American west. He'd seen them in alleys on Manhattan's upper Eastside where Mom and Dad lived in a brown stone between the the home of an investment banker and a guy who held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.

A baby-sized raccoon teetered on the rim of one garbage bin, then dropped abruptly into the dark maw. It was replaced by a burly raccoon with a fat ringed tail who perched on the rim of the can with its head embedded in a yogurt container.

The sight of big-assed Margaret stomping past the window with a big-ass shotgun raised to her big-ass shoulder increased his already sky-rocketing heart rate. Get me out of here, he was thinking, when she pressed a rifle stock pressed to one eye socket and squeezed the trigger with a meaty finger.

The cute masked critter that looked like his mother with a grapefruit on its head was immediately transformed into red and gray mist from the force of the big-ass rifle.

Chase uncovered his eyes. Not a thing was moving. No flipping tails. No tiny ashen fingers. Just a limp, dark carcass amid salad slime and crumpled newspapers in a halo of pink-tinged snow.

Chase sank back, chest banging in the back of his throat. His head felt like it was being jackhammered when a sudden bright burst of light split his brain wide open like a cantaloupe.

By the time Margaret got back to the living room, the new kid---Jason? Chasen?\-- was passed out on a couch. She couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with him so she leaned over and shook him.

She'd been standing around for a long time waiting for him to finish in the bathroom so she could explain the house rules to him and then she'd had to run outside to chase off those fucking raccoon who'd gotten into the garbage again before Hazey arrived with the Certification Review Team. She'd have done anything to avoid throwing Hazey into a shit fit; he'd already declared jihad on the coons. The boy had seemed fine when he went into the bathroom, hung over, maybe a little strung out, just like every other kid who came escorted to the program.

Was he now asleep? Playing possum?

She watched his chest for a minute, expecting to see it rise and fall. Instead, his pulse jumped erratically in his neck like a live wire. His pulse rate was so high, she could barely count it. She flipped his body up to sitting, then forced his head down between his knees, pushing it down below the level of his chest to help his blood pressure level out while she speed-dialed 9-1-1.

Shit in a shoe!

Hazey didn't pay her nearly enough. A kid barely out of high school was dying in her arms of heart failure.

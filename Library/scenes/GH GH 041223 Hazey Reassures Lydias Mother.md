GH GH 041223 Hazey Reassures Lydias Mother

After Alma, his ex-wife ran off with the horse whisperer, Dr. Aloysius Hazey, often sat in his office staring out at Lake Coeur D'Alene as it froze over. He found it impossible to do anything productive. A stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical health care premiums needed to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the earnest but sour head therapist, remained unread and unsigned.

He checked the clock again. Another hour before he could reasonably down a second muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck, during his check-in with Lydia's mother. He could check out after his session with Old Girl but not before.

Today's number one priority job was to assure Rahel Hunts-a-Lot about Lydia's progress which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. She had six more write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct.

Her entire file was stuffed with the carefully coded phrases of dysfunction: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (I.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening but still nascent (keeping her under lock-and-key was working when she didn't escape). "

What Dr. Hazey could say definitively about Lydia Bronfman was that her \$18,000 --a-month fees were always on time.

Parents like Lydia's mother wanted to meet with Dr Hazey, the Founder of Inner Horizons, to be reassured. He'd tried fruitlessly to pass this duty off to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene but she had no idea how to be reassuring. She had a problem with brutal honesty. Parents would meet with Darlene, of the dour and untrusting personality, and there went another monthly fee transferred away to the new Anorexia Unit at McLain or Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu. God, it was a dog-eat-dog- in the depression-and- anxieties-world.

Hazey's trick was to hit the right balance between avuncular reassurement while avoiding the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact, almost every adolescent he'd ever met had a common predilection for sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

Rahel Bronfman HUNT turned out to be was a martially thin, dark-haired woman. A perfect clone of her daughter or, he supposed, vice versa. Lydia was also tiny but rounded in that still childlike way while her mother was tight and lean without an ounce of softness. Calves like knots rose above excellent ankles and her hips were narrow as an adolescents. Lydia's mother worked out harder than the Marines.

Rahel's first question was whether her daughter was gaining any weight. "She has a tendency to fat, like I do." The hip she patted was as flat as a coyote. It was not hard to see where Lydia got her obsession with food, though the woman was

attractive in a feral, hungry way. When she laid a hand on his arm---he'd made the mistake of sitting with her on the couch---he felt like a cream puff awaiting very sharp teeth. "Help my little girl," the mother said in a throaty voice. "Lydia's all I have."

He tried to probe why Rahel didn't call in during Lydia's weekly family therapy. Her answer: "I've been out of the country" as if cell phones and WhatsApp hadn't been invented.

"Kids feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their well-being" he said gently.

"I'm a good mother!" she barked. "What did she say about me?"

Hazey s deflected the danger by saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfman---your father?--- is the father figure in Lydia's life." The lifelong issue between absent mother and angry daughter wasn't going to get solved in a 45-minute fly-by. "Lydia is happy you are here," he said. "Just don't be surprised if she acts out."

"Of course," Rahel murmured, patting his hand with an assessing air as if she was feeling a tenderloin for the right amount of marble.

Thank the lucky stars Darlene had been able to convince Lydia to meet with her mother, even though it had taken a marathon of extra therapy sessions and outright bribery because Lydia wanted to take classes at NICC, though she was nowhere near ready for a pass out in the free world.

Rahel's spike heels against the wood floor jackhammered at Hazey's brain with ungodly noise. God, he needed that muscle relaxant that was calling out like a siren from his pocket. He absolutely couldn't. When the woman got back on her Learjet. Then, and only then, could the sirens be appeased with a splash of tonic in an ocean of Bombay.

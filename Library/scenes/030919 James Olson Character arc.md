030919 James Olson Character arc

\<\$W\>

ONE OF THE STUPID FAMILY STORIES Dad loved to tell was the day he had to leave a company board meeting because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to preschool like a house afire and Jamesy and the Schwarzenugget are eating PB&Js and drinking grape juice," Dad liked to say. "There's a mini-Arnold with his arm around James, drinking out of the same glass. That night, Maria Shriver calls up and says James left a perfect bite mark on the kid's butt. So I tell James to bite his tongue next time. Or at least wait till after my next board meeting."

As if James could control his urge to act which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. No advance planning involved. The impulse came. He bit down.

It was only later, like the moment he stared at the crazy pattern in the safety glass of a shattered windshield, that he realized it wasn't as fun as it looked.

"What the shit?" he cried, when the new girl whose name he'd forgotten, landed in his lap during Process. Her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at the black girl's attractive face upside down. Her pupils rolled up in her head like a window shade; the whites were mapped with tiny red capillaries he couldn't follow. He had a strong urge to cradle her face. If he put his hands on her, he could show her he was there. Make sure she knew she wasn't alone.

Darlene barked at him, "Don't touch her head. She might bite you!" He let go and his hands flew up like startled birds.

The girl flopped like a carp, half on the wood part of the floor, half on the carpet. She seemed gone from herself, off in some oblivion where she went to hide when her body betrayed her.

Everybody in Process perched on the edge of their seats and watched the show as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between thankfulness that the seizure put an end to Process Group and truly appalled at the sight of Old Girl nearly kneeling on the new girl's elbows while Darlene shoved a towel under her neck.

James laid his hands on her thin, long legs and he felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if she were being electrocuted. Her heels tattooed against the floor while James pressed down with all of his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying-on of hands on a person seized by electricity\-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. This girl's body had a will, an agenda all its own. He glanced over one shoulder at Lydia and tried to connect with her, wondering if the bodily highjacking shook her as much as it shook him. Lydia was plucking at a cuticle and didn\'t look up.

The fit seemed to go on forever, until a bone-jarring shiver started at the girl\'s head and rolled through her body the way a dog shook off water. Hazel eyes -- a bruise-darkened green -- popped open. The girl glanced around the circle of faces and James had the impression she thought she was in hell. Consciousness came to her slowly, followed by a deep blush of shame. The monster is out of the closet, and it's me.

"Are you OK?" Darlene was asking her. James squeezed one hand, feeling fingers thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then met his eye and she let go of his hand as if burned.

By the time Darlene and Bruce and Margaret got her loaded into the van, Process Group was officially toast.

They spent the rest of the time processing the moment when the new girl lost it. Lydia said the girl fell in James' lap because she wanted to give James a blowjob. "I thought I'd have to fight her off."

Reza, his annoying motor-mouth roommate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants.

"Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

Old Girl was irate. "They must have known Rachel was epileptic!" she cried. "What the fuck's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than let her rip him a new asshole with her razor tongue. The girl was pretty scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. She had an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he was more familiar with at the bottom of a tequila bottle. "Careful of what?\" he asked. \"Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

Paul, the silent Aspberger math wizard, spoke in his rusty voice. "She looked like the Exorcist."

You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul as if they'd heard from a ghost.

"What are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

People laughed. Paul went back to doodling equations on the back of his hand.

Lydia bumped James from behind, the sign she wanted to have sex. How could she think about sex when he was shaken to the core?

James's Dad, CEO of Life Monitor, a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, and a neurosurgeon, were used to giving orders and being obeyed, like Lydia. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning. This was what Josh, his therapist, had reminded him right before James walked into Process. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked. James's answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

Dr. Mom was always asking him why he did the shit he did. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time," was the only answer that made any sense to him.

When he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on lean or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka \-- it didn\'t seem to James that he had trouble staying on task or that he was easily distracted. He did great at basketball and track.

Once, in a good moment with Dr. Mom, he asked her why he and Susan, his sister, were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system figures out how to talk to your frontal cortex."

He'd looked up the limbic system. As he understood it, the lizard brain housed all his fears and fuck-ups. The frontal cortex controlled the decision-making parts of his brain. Maybe his love affair with Circle K had fried his cortex? Or was he born with a cortex the size and hardness of a walnut? He asked as much the day they were eating pizza on the way to his basketball game and Dr. Mom said, " Oh, no, James. Your cortex is the right size. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to the rest of your brain yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections.

"Time," she said, in her matter-of-fact way. "Only time makes the brain connect." She sighed. "And good genes."

Maybe that's why Susan did so well. She had the good genes and the high, round Olson forehead. All those genes and connections she inherited had programmed her to get straight A's in AP classes when he barely made it into Cal State despite a basketball scholarship.

Plain freckled Susan did exactly what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by any text or IM from his pals.

Lydia's demand that he meet her for stand-up sex in the bathroom off the living room --- even though he was beginning to hate the sight of her ---was no different. Susan would have said, "I have to study for my Calc test," while James\' Pavlovian response was always, "F3A3."

Fuck yeah, anytime, anywhere, any place.

Today? Fuck with Lydia? Not so much.

WHITE PAGE. WHITE SHROUDED TREE. White lawn drifted into alien shapes that reminded James of a Hieronymous Bosch nightmare done in white. Even the people who'd lived their lives in Idaho were shaking their heads at the record-breaking snowfall.

A raven scraped across the sky outside the window in the library carrel where James labored. Its dark shadow looked like a line of handwriting jerking across an empty page.

What James was supposed to do in his Impact Letter was own up to his behaviors. "Take accountability" for all the shit he'd done to his parents. There were two big problems with the assignment due for his family therapy call today. Problem One. James couldn't remember half the shit he'd done in his alcohol and weed and purple drank fog. Problem Two was he didn't *want* to remember what he'd done.

At night, around two or three AM, odd flashes of memory continually woke him. A cracked windshield. A girl with a red hair band toking a joint. A curved canyon road lined by black weedy chasms. He cracked a breath mint and even the taste brought back the eucalyptus smell that filled the Corvette in his first waking moments after the crash.

Why would anybody want to take accountability for walking away from the sound of labored breathing? Who would have thought there could be so much blood? James had a crappy paperback copy of Macbeth in his backpack, cadged from the Healing House library. In his first months of incarcerated boredom before he'd earned the right to take a few classes, he'd whipped through all the thrillers and spy novels, even the romances which gave him a lesson on how much girls liked oral sex. Now he was down to the stuff nobody else would read. What blew him away is his discovery that he'd been eating cotton candy when raw steak was available. Had Lady MacBeth been there the night of the crash?

He read the start of his list out loud. "I got in a car crash while stoned." Did it sound better to write *I got stoned and the car got away from me*? A memory of leaning over to toke a joint that the girl -- he didn't even know her name \--held out to him. *A girl in a red hair band asked me to give her a ride to a party in Topanga Canyon*. *I thought I was saving her from taking the bus.*

James brushed the memory of the crash away like the glass shards that had littered his lap.

*I stole money.*

It wasn't like taking twenty or thirty bucks from the cash drawer his mom left for the house cleaners was a giant deal. Fungible. A new word he learned in Intro to Humanities with Dr. Lengel. Mom, a neurologist with an international reputation, replenished the drawer like clockwork every few weeks. What was a fungible fifty or a five hundred between family members?

He checked the clock on the library wall. An hour already gone. Mrs. Lengel had pointed out a list sentence in Huck Fin about rafting on the Mississippi that lazed on for 174 words. Her advice*: When you're stuck you can always write a list..*

*Lying*

*Drinking*

*Getting stoned on cough syrup mixed with codeine*

*Skipping class*

*Writing prescriptions from Dr. Ida's prescription pad*

*Selling household items to buy Circle-K*

Dad hadn't said anything but James waited during every Family Call to be asked about the missing Patek Phillippe watch.

James circled back and scratched out the prescription pad admission. Maybe Mom, who was brilliant with axonal connections and glioblastomas and meningiomas, was still clueless about what James had been up to. He had a blank pad or two hidden away in his underwear drawer, just in case.

What else?

Just cover the big stuff Josh had said. Where did *walked away from a bleeding lump* *in the passenger seat* fall? Was there some category beyond the big stuff for the heinous?

He shut the notebook, releasing the heinous with the raven.

Nevermore.

\<\$W\>

THE TRAIL TO TWO MOUTH LAKE CLIMBED gently for a mile. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of this hellhole, he wanted to be in shape to play basketball at Cal State. Would the move back home to California be like going from one circle of hell to the next? He'd been working his way through *The Inferno* from the rag-tag library at Healing House, not that he'd ever let about his voracious reading to his parents. They'd long since given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but World of Warcraft.

As they zigzagged up the hillside, James caught views of the blue upper peaks. Grayish-white in the near-distance, white-blue in the distance, until a vastness stretched diamond white and merged with the sky. A stutter flight of a bird was shocked out of a bush by their noise. It winged away in flight with tight claps of its feathers to its body in a syncopated stroke-stroke-stroke and gliiiiiide.

The group griping quieted down once the trail steepened.

James was glad Lydia got left behind at Healing House. She was still in a wicked snit about how James had wrestled her hand away from his crotch in the van, which was how Bruce caught them. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight! The fucktard. Was he a piece of meat? He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Lydia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the women's bathroom at NICC where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (Progress! Dr. Mom enthused on their weekly Family Call.)

He wished he was taking Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Lydia was motivated by the danger rather than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for love, he told himself. It would be nice just to be liked.

The new girl, Rachel, tramped steadily behind him. She was keeping up with him and they were way ahead of the pack so he assumed she was in pretty good shape. He'd heard she was into ballet. Old Girl, who was dogging their heels, was also in shape but she didn't count because she spent hours on the treadmill every day. James always had to hand over his allowance so she'd let him have an extra forty-five minute run. Five bucks for a weekly allowance! What kind of trouble could you get in with that? James remembered the day he turned eight and Dad handed him \$50 for his first allowance. The look on Mom's face when she found all the licorice he hid under his bed.

Giant snow-heavy Ponderosa pines pinched off light on the trail. It felt claustrophobic. A whumph of snow dropped from a branch in a blinding plume that made him jump.

James was always cold in Idaho. When you grew up in Malibu, shorts and flip-flops were all you wore to armor yourself against the day. Idaho required a full body suit of flannel and wool and two-inches of down. Sometimes it felt so thick, it felt like he was choking. Today, though, he was sweating. He threw off layers of down and wool and polyester that smelled rank and disgusting. He'd expected a sense of freedom or at least largeness when Mom and Dad told him they were sending him to the Idaho wilderness "to grow up." Instead, he felt small and inconsequential, a mere speck, in thousands of miles of trees and mountains and ice that stretched to forever.

"Slow down!" somebody in the back yelled. Rachel stepped on the back of James' snowshoe and he almost fell over. "Sorry!" she said. James knelt to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the straps. "It's okay, I was dreaming."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she was worried about breaking Inner Horizon's endless rules. They'd gotten the mandatory stay-together lecture at the trailhead. James had heard it fifty times, even at the bowling alley.

Old Girl stepped out of the trail and skirted around them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "Don't sweat it," he said to Rachel, "It's OK as long as the three of us hang together."

He tramped steadily upward, glad to work on his endurance. The stillness was disconcerting. No foot tracks. A soft skitter of some four-footed creature's footpads. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone who lived at the end of their street. What he'd really like to see is a wolf though he'd settle for an elk. Something majestic. If he saw an elk, he'd have something he could talk about on the weekly Family Torture call.

James parents were always asking him why he never thought about the consequences. Generally, he thought, "Hey, this'll be rad!" Or "Whooee!" Lately, when he woke up gasping with his heart going 180 beats a minute, he wondered if the fun had ever been worth it.

If that was the life lesson he was fated to repeat, how could he bear it?

His parents should just give it up and accept that James was a fuck-up and a loser. Not everybody could be like his sister with her astronomical SAT scores. James had endured a week of agonizing dinnertime angst hoping that his scores had gotten lost on the way to Siberia.

He checked the mail faithfully back then but once he started coming home drunk and stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks?

A shit load, it turned out.

JAMES HAD THE BAD LUCK TO run into Rachel in the girl's bathroom at Northern Idaho Community College. He was coming out of the disabled person's stall after waiting a minute or two for the coast to clear after Lydia strolled out. She had reapplied her lipstick.

James had figured out that blow jobs were rough on lipstick. He had pink stains on his underwear to prove it. James took his time doing some stretches. Standing sex put a strain on his lower back. It wasn't that Lydia was heavy, in fact, she was more like an oversexed doll than a taller than normal 18- year-old.

Rachel met his eyes as he came out of the stall. She was leaning against the sink with a frown.

"Why do you let her abuse you?" Rachel said.

"Abuse me? We have sex."

"Leia doesn't give a shit about you. Aren't you worth more than a quickie? "

I'm worth less than a quickie, James thought.

"Do you mind?" Rachel waved toward a stall. \"I\'m here for a reason.\"

Well, me too, James wanted to say. But the door swung open and shit-on-a-stick, James's Intro to Humanities teacher, Mrs. Lengel, walked in.

Professor Lengel looked enquiringly at him. James flashed her his trademark crumpled smile, like maybe she'd think he got mixed up between the Men\'s and the Women\'s and he beat it the hell out of there.

He didn't think Rachel would rat him out back at Inner Horizons, but you never knew. People made up stories about each other in Process Group all the time to relieve the boredom. All he knew about Rachel was that she was a cutter. She seemed a lot more interested in hurting herself than hurting someone as lame as James. There was always hope.

\<\$W\>

"ARE YOU, LIKE, THE ONLY BLACK person in Idaho?" James asked Josh, his therapist on the day he was supposed to read his Impact Letter to his parents.

Dr. Joshua Isaiah Samuelson, Ph.D, to the world, and Josh to James, raised one eyebrow. "There's my wife."

James wanted to kill time until his parents called in on the conference line for their weekly Family Therapy Call.

"One time I saw you walking downtown and people turned around to look at you so fast you could hear the wind whip through their ears."

"Feeling anxious, are you?"

To say James would rather swallow glass than read his Impact Letter was putting it mildly.

"I'll be on the hot seat soon enough. Seriously, don't you feel weird being different?"

Josh shrugged. "Anybody different always stands out."

James, blond, blue-eyed, basketball-fit, fit right in with the Aryan Nation headquartered at nearby Priest Lake, Idaho. Still, he wouldn't have been surprised to learn that there was a secret Inner Horizons pheromone that telegraphed "misfit!" to anyone who came within a hundred yards of him. Was that how the Mormon polygamist's wives felt?

Yesterday, he had seen two blond young girls, at the most 15 or 16, shopping at Osco Drug in long pioneer dresses. Both girls had strange Elvis-type pompadours over their foreheads that cascaded into intricate rolls of braided hair down their backs. James couldn't figure out the physics of the braids. If he'd had a sister who was into hair dressing, instead of calculus, he would have asked her how they did it.

\"Any advice on how to get through this?"

"Tell the truth. Be real."

James was unconvinced of the value of reality; he'd been successfully avoiding it for years. Duh-DUT. Duh-DUT. Duh-DUT. Somebody with a sick sense of humor had reprogrammed the conference phone to play the theme song from "Jaws." Last week it had played "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

"Hi, sweetheart!" Dr Ida, James's mother sounded cheery today unlike last week's ice queen. Dad growled, "Hey Bud." His old pet name for James. James couldn't remember the last time he'd used it.

"Hey." It was only one little word but the sound came out of James half strangled, as if his vocal cords were already seizing up.

Josh started the session by laying down the ground rules. James had spent the last few weeks working on his Impact letter, a response to the Impact letter Dr. and Mr. Olson had written several weeks ago that detailed the events that led up to sending James to Inner Horizons. That's when James had learned the hard way the *real* reason they called it an Impact Letter: the heinous stuff his parents said he'd done hit him like a hail of stones. Now that the lacerations from two weeks ago had scabbed over, James was supposed to open them back up by "taking ownership of his own behaviors." Inner Horizons. Where they flayed your skin off an inch at a time.

Josh nodded at him: Put neck (A) into guillotine (B).

"Mom and Dad, there's been a lot of lying." His words came out low and mumbled, but at least they were out there. He'd lied to them both so many times he couldn't remember telling them the truth.

"Sometimes I stole stuff to get money for drugs." Throat clearing from Dad. Was he thinking about the time James crawled into their bedroom on his stomach and emptied the wallet Dad always kept on the dresser? "Occasionally, I brought drugs into the house." Translation: every day, every hour, every minute he could get his hands on anything psychotropic.

"Excuse me, honey. When you say you stole from us, are you talking about taking Grandpa's coin collection?" Dr. Ida interrupted James' suffering flow.

"Or the house money?\" Dad asked.

Hey, if they could put Tylenol on the grocery list, why not uppers? Downers? James thought.

Dad said, "I wonder if you could talk specifics. Saying you stole from us is kind of general. We noticed money going missing.

Stay above the surface, he told himself. The only way to get through a quagmire was to hop from one bobbing hummock to another; if he stepped in the quicksand of explanation, he'd sink in slime over his head. Tonelessly, he answered, "Both."

Dad pressed on."Your mother thinks you've been writing prescriptions and signing her name. "

Poke me with a sharp stick and I poke back: The ancient path of their fights, deep as a wagon rut, opened before James like a well-known thoroughfare. "Cut me some slack here! Can't you give me some credit? I'm trying?"

Josh interjected in a calm voice. "I didn't hear your dad accusing you," he said to James. "He was just asking you to clarify."

Clarify that I'm a disappointment. Clarify that I'm a liar and a thief and a fuck-up was what James heard. He looked down at the list of behaviors he had painstakingly written and rewritten. He was maybe five admissions into a list that ran single spaced down both sides of his paper. He clarified doggedly on. "There was lot of school skipping."

Dr. Ida's turn. \"Are you going to answer Dad about forging prescriptions? Do you know I can get fired for that?\"

All of Josh's coaching sloughed off like a layer of soggy tissue. James didn't dare open his mouth, because if he did, his voice would crack and there'd be no holding back the howl that wanted to get out. Before Josh could stop him, James reached over and punched the off switch to the phone. A dial tone droned over the speakers. An EKG machine no longer able to register a pulse.

"What's the use?" asked James.

"I'm not the one who feels like the only black person in Idaho," Josh said. "That would be you."

Josh gave him the money to go out in the hall to get a Coke. "Go clear your head," he said."Then come back and we'll talk about it."

James shot the caffeine and came in after washing his face, thinking glumly of that moment at dinner the other night when Estie stabbed Reza in the back of the hand. James had called Reza "monkey boy" right before the blow up because Reza wouldn't pass the meatloaf while he was messing with Estlie. In the aftermath of Estie's removal with her kicking and flailing and screaming at the top of her lungs, Reza was being carted off in a different direction, still howling in pain. James had forgotten all about calling him Monkey Boy until he realized that Rachel had stopped talking to him.

The frigid expression on Rachel's face when he said "monkey boy" reminded him of the ice freeze on Lake Couer d'Alene. If Estie hadn't broken everything loose by forking Reza, Rachel's stare would have sliced him to ribbons.

"Exciting," was Josh's comment, when James told him what happened at dinner.

"Very," said James.

"Bet you'll pass the peas faster next time, won't you."

"You think I'm going to sit next to Estie after that? You're insane."

"No, James. I'm treating you, not the other way around."

"Would you hurry it up? I'd like to be cured and get out of here. My basketball is suffering."

"So would Reza. Do you see that?"

A long silence. Fucking Josh. Always pointing out the unpleasant smell in the room.

"Are you saying that Reza and I are alike?"

"What do you think?"

"I wish you wouldn't answer every question with another question. It's annoying as shit."

"How do you think Reza feels when you call him Gnat Boy? Or Monkey Man?"

Shit. How did Josh know about that. "How'd you hear about that?"  "It's called 'staff meeting', James."

Reza was so annoying it was impossible to see him as anything better than a midget or a gnat. All James wanted to do was to slap him away and now in mid-thought, the idea that they weren't all that different slapped him in the side of the head. Reza was a fuck up. Reza was a different fucked up than James, sure, but James, in his fug of fuckery, was usually too fucked up to acknowledge it. Now that he'd fucked up with his parents, it was easier to admit that perhaps they weren't the only people he had fucked up with. Rachel's face the night of the stabbing had frozen him to the marrow. Now the memory of Reza's hang-dog, accusatory look was making him feel even lower.

"And by the way, quit calling your roommate 'Apu'. It's not cool," Josh said.

James blinked. Who cared what he called Reza. He would drive a saint nuts. James was only human.

"What do you care?" he asked.

"How would you feel if Reza called you a dumb blond or Kewpie Doll?"

"It's not the same."

"It's exactly the same. A stereotype. 'Apu' is what everybody thinks all Indians are. Shopkeepers with high voices. Did you know his dad is the chief economist at Goldman Sachs?"

"No."

"Do you ever talk to him?"

Reza was always talking to James. "Not if I can help it."

"Does he talk to you?"

"Can't get him to shut up. If I talk back, it'll get worse."

"Well start by calling him Reza. Baby steps."

"I thought we were talking about my relationship with Rachel."

"We are."

Hmmm. Josh's cryptical elliptical comments generally had a point. James had worked with him long enough to know that. Was he saying that James was a racist? If not a racist, a stereotyper? A generalizer? Reza didn't remind James of Apu, not really. He was a midge, a gnat, some constantly buzzing, circling insect he was always trying to slap down but Reza was so quick, he'd always got away.

Was it possible there was a real person inside the ADHD, meth-addled package? One could only hope, as his mother liked to say.

"You know Reza's ADHD."

"Half the kids in Malibu are on Adderall. Why isn't he?" 

"He's on Adderall."

"And this is what he's like on drugs? What, is he a ping pong ball without them?"

It was Josh's turn to roll his eyes. The whites were startling in his polished teak face. "Just cut him some slack is all I'm saying. He doesn't act this way to piss you off. He can't help it."

"Why don't you just help me get a new roommate?"

"Because helping doesn't work that way. What if Reza has something to teach you?"

"Besides 'thou shalt not kill'?"

"Throw him a bone, James. Take Apu out of your vocabulary."

James's mind was running through a list of Apu substitutes: monkey, Simba, orangutang, midget, idiot, shit for brains. Fine, he thought, deep-six Apu and upvote monkey's paw. If Reza woke up screaming again tonight, he was going to put a sock in his mouth.

"He's so annoying!"

"So are you. I don't go around talking like a valley girl to you because you piss me off."

James said stiffly, "I don't do valley speak."

"Like... absolutely, dude. Cowabunga." Josh was shaking his head, smiling.

"Cow-fucking-abung. Matt Gruening had a lot to answer for, thought James. Or was that from the guy who wrote Snoopy? Same diff.

"You're a typical white male of privilege. Good hearted in a lot of ways but also clueless about your roommate. Sure, Reza has annoying qualities. It's not OK to treat him as subhuman."

James thought this was patently unfair. He knew Reza was a human being but humanity was pretty far down on his agenda. He was just trying to get through the day in his own morass of shame and self-loathing.

"Reza has feelings?"

"Of course he has feelings," Josh said. "Use your head."

James head was typically employed in figuring out how to kill him at maim him at various points in the day for irritating the shit out of him.

"Would it kill you to be nice to him once a day?" 

He'd die of shock, was James' first thought. His second was, or I would.

Thus in small steps do we all make progress toward opening our hearts and letting the other in. But it will be years before James figures that out. He'll work with a young Indian man named Riyad in his thirties who reminds him of Reza. Riyadh is from India. He's Hindi, not a muslim like Reza. James will have grown enough by then to know the difference which wasn't the case when he was in treatment. He will ask, apropos of nothing, what Riyadh's name means. When the slight South Asian man with the same golden-brown coloring as Reza says, "contentment" something will strike a chord. He's amazed when he looks up the name and sees that both Reza and Riyadh are from the same word root and have similar meaning. He has no idea whether Reza ever reached contentment. He wished he'd had the presence of mind to ask him the meaning of his name but since he didn't, he asks Riyadh about his family and the village he comes from and he remembers and uses his name when he sees him after that in the cafeteria.

JAMES BAGGED POTATOES AT THE SORTING TABLE in the Coeur D' Alene Food Pantry for his community service hours. It was a mindless task. Mindless suited him just fine. All the excitement of the fire and staying up till 3AM, then being so wound up with adrenalin after his close proximity to Rachel under the blanket, made it impossible to get any sleep last night.

All morning, his eyeballs felt as gravelly as the dirt encrusted Idaho potatoes he was shoveling like an automaton into net bags. Spuds, that's what people in Idaho called them. He was way more efficient than Reza who fucked off next to him, using a one-potato-two-potato method while James used his whole arm to roll the lumps to the lip of the table so he could shove them in the bag in one dump. They had about a ton of potatoes to bag before noon when the poor people were allowed into the Pantry to fill their bags.

Thank God they\'d brought in a new guy to fill out the shift or they would have been bagging potatoes for days. James prided himself on working fast, but this guy was a bagging machine. He'd consistently filled two bags to James's one and barely broken a sweat.

At the 10 o'clock break, he said hey to the big guy. His name was Lorenzo. He was freckle faced and so big, he could have made it onto the NICC football team as a walk on. A cap of red curly hair stuck out all around his head under a baseball cap embroidered with letters.

\"What\'s LDS stand for?\" James asked, nodding at the logo above the bill.

\"Church of the Latter Day Saints,\" Lorenzo said.

\"You a Mormon?\"

"Used to be." Lorenzo sucked at a Coke he'd drawn from his backpack. "It's an old hat."

\"Breakfast of champions," James raised his own Coke can in salute. "Should have known you weren't Mormon. Isn't caffeine against the rules?\"

Lorenzo shrugged. \"I don\'t think I\'m going to hell for it. Are you?\"

You can't go to hell if you're already there, James was about to say but when Reza, who was perched on the spud table, tossed up a potato he was trying to juggle and lobbed it at James's head like a missile.

James caught the spud easily with one hand. "Jeez, Reza, could you put some of that energy into bagging?"

Another of Reza\'s potatoes careened out of a wobbly arc and rolled off the sorting table on Lorenzo's side. The big dude went under the table to retrieve it and came up with two more runaways on the floor. Lorenzo stood and tossed all the potatoes in the air and he kept all three flying effortlessly in an easy rhythm. You gotta start with ones that are the same size when you\'re learning, he told Reza.

Without missing a beat, he grabbed an oversized potato and added it to the three potatoes already spinning at even intervals over his head. The trick was to counter-weight the heaviest, lop-sided potato against three of the same size and pretty soon, Reza was trying out his method with two evenly weighted potatoes, then, three potatoes, and when he was starting to get it, James gave Lorenzo's method a try. James, always good with his hands, was surprised to see that Lorenzo\'s teaching was pretty good.

Mr. McGregor, the volunteer supervisor, rolled in from the cold room with a wheel barrel full of parsnips at the moment James, Lorenzo and Reza all had multiple spuds flying over the heads in unison. McGregor, a balding ex-priest, laughed. He shook his head good-naturedly, but told them to get in gear before the Food Pantry opened its doors to the clients. "Hungry people shouldn't be made to wait."

After that, James and Lorenzo buckled down, and even Reza picked up his pace, and by the noon buzzer, the end of their shift, they'd finished the mountain of potatoes and made a pretty good dent in the parsnips.

"Bet you don't know the difference between parsnips and a girl?\" Reza said to Lorenzo in the back room where hey were putting away their aprons in the lockers.

\"I\'ll bite\" Lorenzo said.

\"A girl gets eaten. Parsnips don't."

James rolled his eyes. Stupid Reza.

Lorenzo looked blank. \"I don\'t get it.\"

Lorenzo turned in appeal to James who had been fantasizing all morning about the feel of Rachel pressed next to him under the blanket, as if he expected James to explain.

"Introduce him to Lydia, and he can learn it the easy way!" Reza said.

\"Are you talking about Lydia Bronfmann?" Lorenzo said.

The open and friendly gaze that Lorenzo had worn all morning was replaced by a frown. Lorenzo's expression was so glacial, James had a sudden memory of a family ski trip to Salt Lake City when Dad drove by the angel Moroni in front of the Mormon Tabernacle and said the naked angel was freezing his ass off.

James was about to tell Lorenzo to forget it, it was just Reza horsing around in his idiot-brain way but he stopped when he saw real anger on Lorenzo's face. This guy *liked* Lydia? *Lydia Bronfmann* was someone worth having her honor defended?

Knowing Lydia in the Biblical sense didn't make James the best champion of her honor and neither did knowing her behavior when she didn't get her way. But in one of those rare times in his life when James found himself close to a precipice, he had the good sense not to jump. Which is why he surprised himself by snapping at Reza to shut the fuck up. He confided to Lorenzo, "Parsnips taste OK to me. They're better than turnips."

In a miracle of good timing, Margaret honked the horn outside in the parking lot to let them know she was here with the van to pick them up. " Sorry, that's our ride." James gestured vaguely toward the steady honking as if he would have liked to hang out and explain.

Lorenzo raised a hand the size of a ham. \"See you next time."

\"Sure. I'll say hey to Lydia for you."

"Appreciate it."

When Reza piled in the van after him and slammed the door, James said, "Jesus, man! Use some judgment! You're lucky you didn't get pounded into a greasy spot!"

Reza, busy pulling out three potatoes he\'d stuffed in his pocket, said, \"Pretty cool juggling tips, weren\'t they?\"

James let out a groan. What would it be like to go around every day of your life like Reza, completely immune to the feelings of the people around you?

The juggling lesson had been like watching a marigold bloom. Reza's saffron-brown skin glowed. His liquid brown eyes shone with the intense light of concentration. All his usually nervous movements were concentrated on the task of juggling. Reza, for once, didn't seem annoying. He seemed hard working. Invested in learning and acquiring a skill.

James had cheered him on, saying, "You're getting it."

When Reza kept two potatoes aloft for a long minute, James even applauded. Caught up by Reza's joy in his own accomplishment.

Lorenza, so solid and stolid of body, was a good teacher. Clear. Patient. He pointed out when Reza had a good toss. He broke down the steps of juggling---the toss, the loft and the release---with precision. James could see how Reza leaned into the older boy's assurance and skill and encouragement. When Lorenzo praised Reza, he flushed with shy pride. James had a momentary flash of his father walking along next to him on his first bike ride, steadying him with his big hand, then steadying him with his big voice as he pedaled away on his own. "You're getting it, you're getting it," he heard his dad saying and was surprised to hear the same words come out of his mouth to Reza.

James already knew how to juggle. He wasn't great, but he could keep three balls in the air if he worked on it. He thought he might be able to master four with practice.

"I didn't know you could juggle," Reza said in the van.

"It didn't come up."

"I've been trying to learn for months. So how come it came up with Lorenzo and we don't even know that guy?"  James was hard pressed for an answer. He hadn't thought about what Reza wanted. It hadn't occurred to him to pass along his knowledge. It wasn't a priority. And yet.

Reza had been so thrilled. Flushed and blooming like a small brownish-yellow flower in the sun ofLorenzo's regard. He felt a little crappy. Why hadn't he taught Reza the rudiments of juggling when he saw him struggling? Reza had dropped spuds all over him week after week.

Selfish.

The word flitted into his consciousness and shocked him with its truth.

"Don't juggle those in here here or I'll pound you into a greasy spot myself."

Reza juggled anyway and James surprised himself again by ignoring him until the end of the day, when they went to the locker room together..

"Still bummed about not having a girlfriend?" James asked.

Reza was picking at a scab on his knee. "My family believes in arranged marriage." He spoke in a high, sing-song Indian accent. "Rezaya, there'll be no dateeng until after marriage!"

"I thought that was illegal."

Reza laughed. "No one makes you do it. You just do it to yourself because your parents had it done to them."

"You can say no."

A snort. "Have you met my mother? Try refusing her. It's like running into the invisible brick wall. She can't be knocked down."

When James was done toweling off, he noticed that Reza, in typical ADD mode, had left his tennis shoes in the bathroom. Throw the dog a bone, he told himself. He carried the walked-down-at-the-heel Vans back to their room and put them under Reza's bed without saying, "don't say I never did anything for you."

And because he didn't say that, it felt natural not to call him Apu either.

Baby steps.

\<\$W\>

JAMES SLEPT DEEPLY SUBMERGED IN DARK WATER like the moose.

He floated for a long time, rising up through blackness, through brackishness, through blue dimness before the world of his dorm room revealed itself in gray oyster light. Fuck. He wanted to go for a run in the worst way. He\'d seen people running occasionally on the Idaho roads, covered in wool hats and tights and gloves. It was a wonder how they managed to stay upright on the mornings when black ice hid under the deceptive blanket of snow.

He remembered stopping a runner who loped past the van at the NICC drop-off when Margaret was at the wheel. He'd ignored Margaret\'s screech \-- \"James! You nimrod! Get back here! \-- so he could ask, "What are you putting on your shoes?\"

The grizzled dude pulled his foot up like he was stretching his quad in order to show screw heads poking up through the waffle weave. \"Idaho cleat,\" he said. "Two inch screws work best. Carpet tacks are OK but they wear out too fast.\"

James lay with his head on the pillow, contemplating the ceiling light. He was wondering how in hell he was going to get his hands on a hammer or anything sharper than a toothpick.

An odd smell intruded on his thoughts. He peered across the room in the gray light for Reza's shoes. He\'d told his dickwad roommate to leave the foul, sweat-stained Vans out in the hall. He couldn\'t see them but that didn\'t mean Reza hadn\'t stashed them under the bed or in the closet. James would have to bury them in the trash bin next to the garage so Reza wouldn't find them. He'd piss and moan. Too bad. Vans out of sight, Vans out of mind.

The smell was sweetish. Very strong. James sat up and switched on the light.

The door swung open. Reza walked through the door clad in tee shirt and jockey shorts, the slopped-on shoes affixed to his skinny feet. Ever since James's Monkey Boy comment and his abortive apology, Reza had kept his distance. He was mulish, somehow, his small body plank-like and stiff. It wasn't that he had stopped talking -- that was never going to happen -- but he talked mostly to himself. In the days pre-apology, Reza used to want James' attention; now he didn't give a shit if he was listening.

A tinny buzz emanated from Reza's head as if he was traveling with a swarm of bees. He was wearing the ear muffs he'd stuffed with miniature radio receivers. Therapists with Harvard degrees couldn't figure out that Reza was perpetually rocking out to Sound Garden instead of always being cold.

He had an odd, quizzical expression on his face.

"What?"

"What\'s that thing under your pillow?\"

James turned to look behind him where Reza was pointing. Something wet and dark was leaking on the sheets. James grabbed the pillow he\'d just been laying on and held it out, away from his body. \"Holy fuck!\"

A black crow lay flattened on the bed sheet with outstretched wings. Where its belly should have been, a purple mass of guts was dotted with slowly moving, fat gray blobs. Maggots in seeping flesh.

James and Reza bolted for the door at the same instant.

Reza shouldered through the door a second ahead of James who had to make a standing leap.

\"Margaret!" James shouted.

"Margaret!\" Reza shouted louder.

Their voices echoed down the hall like young children howling for their mother.

\<\$W\>

REZA WAS SUPPOSEDLY WORKING ON HIS IMPACT LETTER while James reworked his apology to his parents. Sisyphus, and his fucking rolling stone.

All Reza wanted to do was talk to James about watching carbuncle popping on YouTube. It was the thing he missed most about the technology they'd taken away.

"What's a carbuncle?" James asked.

"A boil with multiple heads."

When James didn't seem to be able to visualize this, Reza took it upon himself to draw a picture of boil anatomy learned from his viral YouTube hero, Dr. Pushwill. Apparently, specialization in large growth removal was a thing.

"Pushwill? You're making that up."

"Bushmill." Reza stressed the 'mill' syllable but then he seemed to like 'Pushwill' better and decided to earn a four on the Daily Quadrant by writing a thank you letter to Dr. Pushwill for his educational services and contribution to higher learning.

James was thinking darkly about his own benighted letter of accountability, wishing he could wax on and loosen the pressure of evil-smelling keratin and dead cells that were building up to an explosive force.

"I'll congratulate him on how he always knows how to stay out of the way! He starts to shove on the skin around the pus, man, and he has an unerring sense for when it's going to blow." Then Reza went off on seeing Dr. Pushwill spray his assistant JeanMarie in the neck. "She screamed and said she'd never get the stink out! Doc got her to laugh when he said any boil could be a lethal weapon if they weren't so hard to aim."

James felt sick to his stomach. He kept staring at the white paper he couldn't bear to write on. Would it hurt less if he let the truth blow? Or would the stink follow him around forever?

"Have you ever smelled a carbuncle?" he asked, idly.

Of course Reza had.

His father, some high exec at Goldman Sachs, developed one on his hairy back. Reza's mother, a wanna-be nurse, operated on it on the kitchen table.

Ewww. James wondered how they could bear to eat on the table afterwards.

"Hey, do you know what queef is?" Reza, king of the non sequitur, asked.

"Something you shoot up or ingest?"

"It means "expulsion of air through the vagina."

"A vagina fart? That's disgusting!"

"I don't think they smell."

"Really?" 

"They squeak."

James, was ready to change the subject so he tried a non sequitur of his own. "English people eat something called bubble and squeak,"

But does it come from the vagina, Reza wanted to know.

Then like a homing pigeon, Reza was back to the smell of his father's carbuncle. "Pure evil," he said, "like something died in there and rotted while the bastard carried it around in him for years."

This was not helping James get his accountability letter down on paper. Reza had given up on his letter too He said his dad already told him he didn't want to hear any excuses. "What else is there?"

James told Reza to take a hike so he could get some work done.

When Reza finally left to bug Margaret, James stared out the window. The pressure was building inside him but all he could do was stuff it down in a warm dank place and let it simmer.

He hoped he had Dr. Pushmill's luck when it blew.

\<\$W\>

THERE WAS THIS OKAY-LOOKING Idaho girl in English class who sat next to James. He'd noticed her because she was always popping her gum. Annoying but kind of sexy, in a country kind of way. She had a thing for red, white and blue spangles and cowboy boots. Her notebook sported a glossy picture of Shania Twain in cut-offs and she'd written on the front in loopy gold letters, \"That Don\'t Impress Me Much.\" Shania Twain was so out of the California mainstream, she could have been from an alternate universe. James was used to "Do you know the wae" memes and the teeth-chattering Vine of Kermit the frog shaking from all the pressure to get into a good college. Anxiety, LOL! This girl didn't look like she suffered any anxiety about life except maybe whether it was better to take a few classes at NICC or get paid minimum wage making French fries.

Girls in Malibu middle school had decorated their notebooks with Project Runway collages and sayings like "Fierce!" and "I want to be Heidi." Idaho was born behind the times so maybe college girl notebook styles were just another sign of backwardness. Look at that kid in the back of the class who wore black Converse high tops way after not a soul in California would be caught dead in them.

Last week, the country girl offered to let him look at her test when Professor Williams gave them a pop quiz.

James had refused, politely, but today, she passed him a note while Prof. Williams handed back their tests. James put his hand over the A- on the top of his paper while she slid her C- and urgent red "See me!" note under Shania Twain. He could feel her eyes on him as he read the teacher's note on his Huck Finn paper that said it would have been an A if it wasn't late.

\"Got some new weed from Tijuana," her note said. "Want to try it?\"

Did a bear shit in the woods?

After class, she walked him out to a mud-covered Tundra truck in the parking lot. When James asked her what the deal was with the mammoth trailer hitch on the back, she said she was a barrel rider. She turned her back to show him the spangled Indian warbonnet sewn onto a denim jacket. "Wow. '*Queen of the Idaho Warbonnet Rodeo Since 1911,"* he read out loud. " You don\'t look that old."

She snorted, not unattractively.

Prof. Williams had this weird habit of calling all the girls Miss So-and-So. Today he'd called her Miss Tempter. "What\'s your real name?\" he asked.

\"Candy,."

It was James's turn to snort. \"Candy Tempter? That's hilarious."

"Not Tempter---Tremper.\"

\"Bummer." Tempter was way closer to the mark as she expertly rolled a jay between red lacquered nails and got out a lighter.

They were parked in the big lot right in front of the NICC Student Commons, a few rows away from the bench where Margaret picked them up and dropped them off. It was close to three. Margaret was due at 3:15. He had plenty of time to chill and besides, they were parked way back near the fence where nobody would notice.

\"Ladies first,\" he said when she offered him the blunt. She put the blunt between red glossy lips and and sucked in and handed it over.

James hadn\'t had any weed since the night of the disastrous Tequila and weed and Circle K night in Topanga Canyon. He inhaled the familiar, calming smell and he felt the familiar slow relaxing of his veins. He leaned over to pass the joint back.

Rap! Rap! Rap! \"James Olson! You get the hell out of that truck!"

Oh holy shit.

Margaret was standing, hands on her hips, outside the truck, glaring at him as if he\'d beaten her dog.

\"Whoops,\" he said to Candy. "This is slightly awkward."

Candy\'s eyebrows flickered up with astonishment.\"Who the hell is that? Your mother?\"

\"Um.. no. We're ... not related. She\'s\...\" He had no idea how to describe Margaret. An avenging angel? The vacuum Nazi? A go-fer and van driver and sometime cook and all-the-time police?

Rap! RAAAP! It sounded like Margaret was about to put her fist through the glass. James opened the passenger door and shrugged apologetically and jumped down.

\"Thanks for the Shakespeare notes,\" he said, as the smell of weed smell unfurled around him like a runaway snake. Margaret got him up by his elbow and she frog marched him away from Candy and her tempting truck all the way across the parking lot to the van.

\"What the hell are you thinking, you nimno? You\'ve been doing so well. Now you blow it when you're just getting it together?" She turned back, mid-rant, and shouted at Candy who was watching them with wide blue eyes. \"Stay the hell away from him! Can\'t you see he\'s recovering?\"

James felt like he'd shrunk a few inches. He couldn\'t believe how easy it had been to pick up a joint when he\'d sworn he wouldn\'t ever touch one again. It had seemed so instinctive, so familiar and so normal in its familiarity, like being asked if you wanted a Coke or a drink of water and your mouth said yes before your brain agreed. He didn't give a shit about the Inner Horizons agreement to take no drugs that everybody signed when they got to the program; what appalled him was how easy it had been to go blindly against the rule he'd set for himself.

Margaret made him sit up front with her. Nobody else was there yet. According to his watch, James still had five minutes of freedom which he assumed was going to be spent having his ears blistered off. Instead Margaret said calmly, \"Good thing I got here early.\"

\"Why? So you could embarrass the shit out of me?"

\"So I could save you from yourself, nimrod.\"

What the hell was a nimrod? Or a nimno? Some kind of Idaho sheep shit, she had that right.

\"Are you going to write me up?\"

\"Should I?\"

\"I didn\'t inhale,\" he said with asperity.

Inexplicably, Margaret laughed. A big har-har-har Idaho laugh, unaffected and open. He had no clue what the big woman thought was so funny and it would be a decade or more before he heard the phrase \"I didn\'t inhale\" at a party with people of his parent\'s generation who\'d been around when Bill Clinton was president. It would be funny how he would remember Margaret\'s laugh like it was yesterday, when he hadn\'t heard it in years.

\<\$W\>

REZA, UNCHARACTERISTICALLY QUIET SINCE THE NIGHT ESTIE STABBED HIM, WHUFFLED AND SIGHED. After less than ten minutes, he abandoned his writing entirely in favor of picking at the bandage wrapped around his hand. He had been playing with the conforming gauze until it was so screwed up, it would no longer stay tucked. "Would you do this for me?" he said to James. "It's driving me crazy."

"Hey, write your own accountability crap. I've got enough problems with my own."

"Not my letter. Help me with the bandage. It won't stay closed."

James got up from his desk. Plopped down heavily on the mattress where Reza was writing propped up by his pillows. Reza stopped and scooted further into the corner. James unwrapped the grimed gauze. It was wrinkled and gray from being worried and picked at.

"Jesus, this is a mess. Quit looking at it or your hand'll get infected."

"Want to see it?"

"Not really."

Reza. Any carbuncle in a storm.

"Okay, fine," James relented. "It'll be easier if we start over."

Released from its orange-stained inner packing, Reza's hand looked like a piece of raw meat. The dark tine marks stood out like fang marks except with three puncture wounds, not two. The skin was warm, swollen with lymph, and puffy.

James touched the back of Reza's hand gently with one finger. "Does that hurt?"

"Like a bitch."

"She really nailed you."

Reza turned his palm up. On his heart line like stigmata from a very weird snake, three oozing wounds. "Man. The fork went all the way through."

"Good thing she's not any bigger or she would have nailed me to the floor, not just the table," Reza said.

James, made sure not to touch the wound and instead, reapplied antibiotic ointment to the packing. He got rid of the wrinkles, straightened the wrap, and tightened the gauze around the wrist to compress it and relieve pain. Then he reset the butterfly clip so it held. "Now quit fucking with it. You need to keep the bacteria out."

"How do you know how to do that?"

"Mom's a doc." James couldn't count the number of times he'd been wrapped expertly after his many childhood scrapes by her neat surgeon's hands.

"Are you going to be a doc?"

"Oh, hell no."

James had no idea what he was going to be if he ever grew up, but the mountain his mother had climbed was so far up in the Himalayas, he couldn't imagine how she got there. "I barely got into USC. Med school would be ridiculous."

Reza blew out, a windy, sad sound. "I know what you mean. My dad thinks I'm going to get into Harvard. He wants me to be an economist like him.

"Parents."They both spoke in unison, as if the misfortune of sharing genetics turned people insane.

"I'm the one who figured out how to make meth without blowing anybody up. I'm not stupid, you know."

"I know," James nodded, and said into the lull. "About the other night... Um.... I wanted to say I was sorry."

"For what?"

"That thing I said? ...you know? At dinner, the night Estie stabbed you?

When I called you 'Monkey Boy?'"

"Was this before Shit-for-Brains? Or after?"

Reza sucked in a breath, a technique James was supposed to use,

according to Josh, to "self-calm" before he blew up.

"Before 'Midget"? Or later, when you called me 'Mosquito?'"

James face reddened, then got hot as Reza continued.

"'Gnat Boy?' 'Mosquito?' 'Talks-A-Lot-But-Says-Nothing?' 'Moron'? 'Motormouth?' 'Gnat's Ass?' Dork-o-Rama?' 'Dingbat?' 'Dweeb?' 'Ratso?'

'Rizzo?' 'Ditzoid?' Are you sure 'Monkey Boy' was on Friday, not earlier in the week?"

Reza's recitation sped up and the temperature in the room sped up the thermometer with him.

"And would you stop calling me Gandhi! How many times do I have to tell you I'm not Indian, I'm Pakistani?"

"Gandhi was a saint," James said, rather diffidently.

"A Hindu saint, maybe. Not to Muslims." Reza crushed his body deeper into the corner as if to avoid touching James. "And why now? Why all that other shit you called me, why apologize for something as white bread as 'Monkey Boy'? Did you wake up in the middle of the night and convert yourself from asshole to Shiva H. Vishnu?"

Reza on a roll, was Reza on a tear. "I just wanted to say I was sorry...."

ALT

"I really wanted to say I was sorry...," James started again, but Reza didn't let him finish.

"You wanted to say you were sorry." Reza emphasized the tense, willfully changing the present to the past, which wasn't what James meant at all. "Does that mean you were sorry then but you're not sorry now?"

"No, stupid." He stopped, wishing he could take back all the names, starting with stupid. He cleared his throat. Said "I meant I am sorry" with a raised voice, in an effort to make himself understood. The loudness of his deep voice int he quiet room seemed to have the effect of making Reza flinch deeper in the corner. He couldn't be afraid of James, could he? All he was doing was sitting on his mattress.

"Why do you always call me names?" Reza asked. " What's wrong with plain old Reza?"

James blinked. "I... uhm.... I didn't think..."

Reza pounced. "That's your problem. You never think about what you say and how it makes me feel. I call you James every damn day and what do you call me? Stink Bug. I shower just as much as you do!"

"I know that." James passed a hand over his lower jaw where the blond hairs were just beginning to stubble. Reza's dark beard was way ahead of James, he noticed. The one place Reza had James beat. He had to shave twice a day to get rid of it.

"You think everything you say is funny, don't you? Stink Bug always gets a big laugh, so you say it again. People laughed when you called me "Monkey Boy," didn't they?"

Another pass over James's paltry stubble. "I don't know," he muttered. "Estie stabbed you then and you were screaming so loud, I didn't hear it."

Reza was now inspecting his wrapped hand like it was some wounded creature. He cradled it protectively in his lap. "And don't even get me started on 'Apu'! You call me Apu all the time. That's worse. I'm not even Indian."

"No, stupid---." James stopped when the word 'stupid' rolled out of his mouth like a fart. Appalled, he wanted to take it back, along with all the other stupid names that apparently rolled out of his mouth just as stupidly the night of the stabbing and before. "I am sorry." His voice was strained. In the silence, the volume was louder than he meant it to be. Reza shrank as far into the corner as he could. A strange thought entered James head: Reza couldn't be afraid of James, could he? All James was doing was sitting near him in the corner of a room.

"Why do you always call me names?" Reza asked. "What's wrong with plain old Reza?"

James blinked. "I... uhm.... I do but I don't think..."

Reza pounced. "That's your problem. You never think about what you say! I call you 'James' or 'Olson' every damn day and you never call me everything but bullshit."

James felt like something was stuck in his throat. "I don't even know your last name. What is it anyway?"

"You'll never be able to spell it. It's Kamaaliaazaad. Seven As. And that's not even a record in Urdu."

"Are you fucking with me?"

"Always. But that's my name." Reza ripped a page out of his notebook and stabbingly wrote it across an entire line.

James counted the syllables. "So, Reza." He gestured to the name and tried to ease things by making joke. "'Apu is easier than that."

"You think everything you say is funny, don't you? 'Apu' gets a big laugh, so you say it again. People laughed when you called me "Monkey Boy," didn't they?"

"I don't know," James muttered. "You were screaming so loud, I couldn't hear it."

"I fucking hate 'Apu'!" Reza shouted.

This was the point in the discussion where things went from normal to Def Con. Reza eeled off the bed, squeezing himself like a brown Houdini through the small space in between the headboard and the dip in the mattress where James had confined him. It was like a contortionist's maneuver, the way Reza had to slip abruptly sideways, and push himself away from James, as if he was untouchable.

"Jesus, James, you are so clueless."

"You said you love the Simpsons! You told me how funny Apu is. How he makes you laugh. I was just kidding!"

"Apu is a stereotype made up by some white guy about people he doesn't know one thing about. Everybody thinks all South Asians run Korean grocery stores. I'm not going to Harvard but I'm not doing that!"

In the doorway where Reza addressed James, he stood straight and solemn as a judge. He threw James a pitying look and said, "Jesus, James. You were there when those assholes yelled at me to go home," Reza muttered. "What, didn't you notice? Or did you forget?"

A couple of weeks ago, James and Reza had been walking down Main Street in Coeur d'Alene when some guy in a pick-up shouted racial slurs at them. Reza didn't notice at first because he was doing that thing where he was writing music on the back of his eyeballs. He was snapping of his fingers and keeping four-four time with his feet to entertain himself.

"Doesn't that make you mad?" James asked after the red necks made their first pass.

"What?"

"You didn't hear those assholes yell at you?"

"No. What'd they want?"

"They called you..." James hesitated. "...the 'N' word."

"A noodge? Better than being called a Paki. "

James shook his head. The only people who still called people "noodges" were either ten-years-old or a hundred.

"They called you a nigger, Reza."

"In London, it would have been 'rag head.' Or 'bloody mop head.'" Reza, born in Britain, had moved to New Jersey when he was twelve. "They're too stupid in Idaho to know what to call me. I'm not a Spic. Not a Jap. Not a Chink . Not even a stinking Injun, which is the bottom of the Idaho heap, I gather."

James said, "Worse, I think."

"At least they didn't call me bowlegged. I hate that."

James had never thought about what a trial it must be to to be Reza. Not black. Not white. Not anything in know-nothing Idaho except small, strange, suspect. And on top of everything else, clueless.

They'd crossed the street quickly, making sure the truck didn't coming around to run them down.

James asked Reza "Does that happen to you a lot?"

"Quite a bit," he had said.

Back in the quiet dorm room, James cleared his throat in order to try again.

Reza said, "Thanks for the wrap job, White Boy. Not the apology."

Hoooboy.

A loud knock sounded on their door like a signal. Tap-tap- ppppauuuuuse-RAP. Both Reza and James started at the noise.

Reza opened it to Big Paul. James, expecting Big Paul to invite him to play cards, thought that even Hearts were preferable to fighting.

But Big Paul came to see Reza, "Hey, I wrote a new song. Want to hear it?"

Since when did Paul sing? The big autistic kid barely opened his mouth except to eat.

"I wrote one too." Reza grabbed his backpack and scrabbled in the bottom before he pulled out a piece of paper with wandering lines of notes amid trebles and clefs.

"I thought you just wrote on the back of your eyeballs," James said, perplexed.

"My eyelids, not my eyeballs!" Reza snorted disgust. "I work out my music with my eyes closed. Then I write it down so I remember it, Whitey."

He gave James the finger. Shut the door on James with a quiet snick.

Through the door, out in the hallway, James could hear Reza asking Paul what key he wrote in but in James's his mind's eye, he saw was Josh. Pink fingers edged in black skin, hands spread in defeat when James ended the family call by hanging up on his parents. The dial tone till sounding in their ears when Josh remarked, "That went well."

James felt exhausted for no reason.

He rested his head against Reza's small backboard and put his feet up on the covers. He was thinking about the blow-up. Wondering how he had set Reza off and what was the moment of the explosion while peripherally aware of the odd perspective from Reza's side of the room. James was used to looking over at Reza's side of the space but he'd never sat on Reza's side and looked at the space he occupied.

They were both slobs.

Of the two of them, James was the worst.

Reza's mess was contained in a small footprint in the corner. Much of James's crap had colonized the shared space. From Reza's bed, it looked as if James had pushed his roommate deep in the corner until he had no place to go ---unless he folded in on himself.

An extra-long mattress and box springs accommodated James' 6' 5" frame; a big-ass inflated ball allowed him to stretch his back; lacrosse sticks and tennis racket and brand new carbon-fiber snow shoes built bulk and strength; the closet gaped with extra-large clothing and shoes the size of submarines while Reza's smaller clothing was shoved off to the back.

James saw Reza cringing in the corner at his raised voice, in the moment before he made his spring for freedom. James had cluelessly shoved Reza into the corner with his big bulky body and his clueless attitude and clueless assumption that it was Reza's job to make him feel better for apologizing.

No wonder Reza had burst out of the the corner at the first opportunity!

James was more than aware of his own cluelessness; he was slightly nauseated by it. His knee-jerk reaction was to go after Reza to crowd him into compliance. But for once, he thought he knew enough to ignore josh's advice for now about "getting close to him."

Stay in your own lane, James told himself.

Give Reza some space.

EM & WENDY: THIS SCENE IS TOLD IN 2 POINTS-OF-VIEW: RACHEL, JAMES'S FRIEND, FIRST; THEN FROM JAMES POV. I INCLUDED THEM BOTH SO YOU GET THE DRIFT.

\<\$W\>

AT VICTORY LANES, THE SCOREBOARD READ: RACHEL: 42, JAMES: 185.

Crash of pins made constant thunder. The buzz and rumble of a reset button. Ball after ball thundered out of Rachel's hands onto buttery smooth wood and galloped into the gutter with an embarrassing bang and whoosh.

James said, \"You almost had it. Next time, try not to release the ball at the end of your arc.\"

Rachel, who was bad at snowboarding, terrible at board games, a danger to herself and others with a pool cue, continued her athletic shame at Thursday night bowling league.

\"I thought we are supposed to be here for R&R," she said. \"This is torture.\"

James had just stepped up to the bowling lane as gracefully as a ballet dancer. He pirouetted on burgundy and gray lace-up shoes that should have made him look like a dweeb but instead, made him look so gorgeous and unattainable she wanted to cry.

\"You\'re trying too hard,\" he said after the scoreboard lit up with another strike. James: 195 up in red and yellow lights. \"Loosen up." Then as if he intuited she couldn't take any more shame, he said, "Want a Coke? I\'m thirsty.\"

They gave up their lane to Reza and Lydia who were surprisingly competitive. Lydia looked like a '50s rock-a-billy chick with her curly short hair pulled away from her face by a wide red headband. She wore a vintage black bowling shirt that said Detroit Diesel on the back and \"Andy\" in red embroidery over her boob.

\"Nice outfit,\" Rachel said.

Reza, wearing one of James's UC-San Diego tee shirts and blue jeans, said, \"Thanks,\" and then arced a marbleized ball down the lane for a strike.

\"Go fuck yourself,\" James said to Reza. "What?" he said when Rachel chastised him with her eyes. "He wore my shirt without asking!"

In the Burger Shoppe, James spent his entire allowance on a cheeseburger, an orange Nehi with fries and got fifty cents in change. Idaho.

Rachel shook her head at the blue-haired grandma who was apparently both waitress and cook. \"I already ate.\"

\"So did I,\" James said. \"That was two hours ago.\"

She laughed. \"I\'m a girl. Not a bottomless pit.\"

While they waited for the food in a booth next to the pin-ball machine, James took all the sugar packets out and stacked them up. He balanced a glass salt shaker on top of the packets, then added the pepper shaker to the pile and the whole thing toppled over. Pepper sprayed the table and Rachel sneezed.

\"Sorry,\" he said. \"I wasn\'t trying to kill you.\"

\"Finally something you\'re not good at!"

"Au contraire. Stacking sugar packets is an art. It takes hours of practice.\"

\"Have you been practicing your bowling?\"

\"No.\"

\"I didn\'t think so. And snowboarding? You were good at that too. You said it was your first time.\"

\"There\'s not a lot of snow in Malibu." James fixed her with smoke-blue eyes. "So, it was your first time, too. You should cut yourself some slack.\"

\"You were even good at salsa dancing. Doesn\'t it get old being great at everything?\"

James set to restacking the sugar packets in alternating horizontal and vertical directions."You just don\'t know me. Everybody knows I\'m a fuck up.\"

They'd been exchanging smart-ass quips all night and Rachel was sick of it. She folded her hands on the formica table top and waited. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"I want to know.\"

He looked around for the waitress. \"This isn\'t exactly fast food.\"

\"Why do you always do that?\"

\"What?\"

\"Change the subject.\"

\"I didn\'t. I just...\" He stopped, nonplussed.

\"What makes you a fuck-up? That\'s not what I see.\"

\"Well, you're locked up in a psychiatric treatment facility so you\'re not exactly unbiased.\"

She shrugged. \"I like you."

\"Want a bite?\" James caught Rachel eying his French fires with a look of longing. \"Why didn\'t you order something if you\'re hungry?\"

\"It\'s not that easy to admit it when you want something," she said. "Especially if it's always going to be taken away."

\<\$W\>

\"IT\'S NOT THAT EASY TO ADMIT IT WHEN YOU WANT SOMETHING," RACHEL SAID. "Especially if it's always going to be taken away." Wasn\'t that the truth? James wanted so much, especially in the middle of the night, to stop waking up with his heart pounding and wanting to scream. He didn't want to ever again see blood much less smell its wet penny reek.

He cut his burger in half and slid it over onto the french fry plate. Then he swallowed his half -burger in about three bites while she was still elegantly cutting hers into bite-size bits that she speared with a fork. She ate her fries with a fork, too, one at a time. Her manners were so controlled, so elegant, in contrast to her graceless lunges and ball drops on the bowling lanes. Same story on the ski slope where she careened and fell and slid down the hillon her butt, one foot dragging the snowboard like an anchor. She was tall and gangly, built like him, he realized, but she seemed not quite in command of her limbs. He remembered feeling the same way when he was 13, the year he shot up five inches and felt like his body had taken off without him.

\"What are you looking at?\" she asked.

\"You,\" he said. It was true. It was hard to not look at her and want to hold her hand.

\"So tell me why you\'re a fuck up.\"

The terror and helplessness of holding Rachel while she was kicking and jerking during her fit was uppermost in James' thoughts. How he had wanted to help her by stopping her involuntary and embarrassing loss of control. He willed her to come back to consciousness when her eyes righted in her skull and her feet stopped drumming.

\"I killed a girl,\" he said softly.

\"How?\"

\"I was driving. We were drunk and stoned. I went off the road in Topanga Canyon by my house and we rolled.\"

\"Is that how you hurt your shoulder?\"

He nodded, feeling the ghost of the ache that was like a reminder that he couldn\'t ignore.

\"She died in the crash?\"

Why did it feel like he was flaying himself alive? His nerves felt raw and exposed, yet he sat forward and kept talking. She\'d exposed herself to him in all her ugliness and at her most vulnerable. It only seemed fair.

\"I woke up and got out of the car and left her to walk home. She bled to death.\"

\"Did you know she was hurt?\"

\"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"There was blood all over.\" Who would have thought so much blood in her? Macbeth and the shame those words inspired in him the first time he read them came back to him like a wave of nausea.

\"Was she close to you?\"

\"Right next to me in the passenger seat of the Corvette that flew apart like a cardboard car in the crash.\"

Rachel shook her head. "I mean, did you know her well?"

James shook his head. \"She asked me for a ride home. I didn\'t even know her name until after." After, meaning when the cop who interviewed him told him he was being charged with manslaughter and reckless driving and said her name was Charlotte Shantz and he misheard him and thought it was just his luck to kill a girl named Chance.

He realized belatedly that Rachel had reached across the table. She was gripping one of his hands with both of her hands, covering the top and the bottom of his fingers like a protective shell. \"I know,\" she said. \"I know.\"

Her low voice. The warmth of her fingers. The smell of French fry grease and the fog of bar smoke and the intermittent buzz of the reset button. What an odd place to get forgiveness but James would take it.

"It hurts,\" he said.

\"I know,\" she said.

It had been months and months of therapy sessions and Group Gropes and calls with one or the other of his bewildered and frightened parents and he\'d never been able to talk about that night until he told Rachel about the blood he\'d wiped on the cheat grass to get it off his hands. The way the girl -- a year-and-a-half later and he was still unable to refer to her by name which he knew from the newspaper to be Charlotte \-- Charlotte had been breathing high and wheezy in her chest. He\'d woken after the crash in blinding pain and tried to rouse her but she\'d been so far away, all she could do was groan. He\'d had terrible vertigo and it seemed like it took forever to clamber up the rock strewn slope that the Corvette had tumbled down end over end. Big chunks of fiberglass covered with brown paper backing dotted the hillside. A door panel. A chunk of hood. A trunk section still attached to a chrome fender caught in a clump of knapweed. It looked like the car had exploded and what he mistakenly had thought was steel and metal turned out to be nothing but flimsy paper.

When he looked back at the girl from far above her, he could see her still strapped in her seat by the seatbelt and there was barely any car around her. Just a frame and chassis supported by white-wheeled tires and a dashboard. She must have hit her head. Blood was everywhere.

He told Rachel about how he didn't remember getting home, that some good Samaritan gave him a ride and dropped him at the security gate of his parent\'s house. He couldn\'t remember the code to key it in and instead, leaned on the buzzer and told Lupe the maid to come. His mother drove her car down the long drive in her night gown and she took one look at his injuries, and drove him straight to the emergency room. He remembered her standing in a blue lamb-printed nightie talking to the ER doc while he lay on a gurney. After that it was all a blur.

Months later, he learned from reading the newspaper that the girl was probably breathing her last breaths, the wind riffling her henna-red hair, as he half crawled, half stumbled up the hill and walked two miles down the road until a good Samaritan gave him a ride.

Back in the diner, he was staring at Rachel's catsup on the plate. Seeing a featureless face bathed in red. Jesus. How Rachel could even look at him in his naked ugliness, he didn\'t understand.

"I know," she squeezed his hand during this recitation, her warm fingers reassuring him and keeping him talking till all the shame was out on the table. "I know."

Rachel had revealed her own self at its ugliest in her epileptic fit--- when some alien spirit commandeered her body and transformed it into a being nobody recognized----and he recognized a kindred spirit. His body \-- the one he was so used to depending on for his balletic speed with the ball, his three-point sinkers from the corner or the inside \-- his own body had betrayed him at the crucial moment. It had taken him up the mesquite-strew slope, limping, his forearm pinched tight against his ribs as he walked and when he got home to his neurosurgeon mother who might have been able to do something, he never even mentioned the girl he should have saved.

Finally, after what seems like hours and hours of telling, when the flow of words falls off his tongue like rain, James will finally, finally exhaust all language and stop in exhaustion. Rachel doesn't take her eyes off his face.

"Tell Josh," Rachel says. "Then tell your parents."

"What's so important about telling?"

"You get the shit out and it stinks and once it's out, it loses its power to poison you. If it stays inside, it festers or ferments and it grows uglier and the stench grows and pretty soon --like over days and months and years -- it consumes you. You get to eighty or ninety, when you're supposed to have lived a good life, and there's nothing there but puss and shit and ugliness."

"How'd you get to be so smart?" James asks, after a long silence.

Rachel touches her face. Long fingers against a shapely dark mouth. "I'm not smart. Just observant."

"Who'd you observe?"

"Myself," she says.

"And now you."

REZA BEAT JAMES TO A MASSIVE ARRAY OF CANDY at Walmart. It was Friday, allowance day, so they'd guilted Margaret into stopping so they could spend their lousy five bucks for the week.

From the distant end of the aisle, Reza looked to James as if he had Tourette's Syndrome. Reza's body was in constant, nervous motion. He hovered first in front of the bulk candy, as if torn between the jelly beans and the candy corn, then he moved on to peruse the LifeSavers and Skittles, then he touched all the chocolates on the opposite side of the aisle before wandering back to ponder the Bubble Yum and FireBalls. He seemed to want the candy, had to have it in fact, but couldn't settle down long enough to make a purchase.

James finally walked up to him and said, "It's not an entrance exam."

"Might as well be," Reza answered bitterly. "When you want everything and can't have any of it."

"You've got five bucks. Pick one."

"That's it. I can't just have one. I have to have all of them."

James got the idea that Reza was revealing something germane about himself but what? It was like his roommate was caught between wanting the candy and not wanting the candy because his selection would always be the wrong. It was the way James had always felt about drugs.

"I'm not choosing anything. It'll just make me sick," Reza said, turning away.

"Are you diabetic?"

"No."

"Then what makes you sick?"

"Jesus, forget it. Go distract that guy at the counter. I want to steal some cigarettes."

Reza's hand was again hovering, now over the Baby Ruths, then wavering above the Skittles. On to the Mike & Ike's.

"Come on, Margaret said five minutes. We gotta go."

"I can't decide."

"Jesus, Reza, just put some sugar packets in your pocket and then you don't have to decide. Sugar's all the same when it gets in your body."

Reza immediately brightened.

"Hey, that's a good idea. It's all sugar, right? My body can figure it out and then I don't have to choose."

James went up to the front and paid for his Hershey Bar at the counter. He chalked up Reza's indecision to his typical lunacy. Who could understand Reza if he didn't understand himself?

Back in the van, he watched Reza pour packet after packet of sugar down his throat.

"Not bad," Reza said, after the fourth packet. "Kind of boring. I like the texture of Skittles better. They're chewier."

"How can you eat straight sugar?"  "You suggested it. Plus I still have my \$5 and what do you have?" Reza gestured to the empty Hershey wrapper in James's hand.

It was then that James understood that he knew zero about what made Reza tick---or anybody else, starting with himself.

Reza poured two more packets into his mouth. Let the papers fall to the floor. Margaret bellowed, without turning her eyes from the wheel, "Pick that up or I'll make you swallow it."

"Where'd you get that third eye?" Reza asked.

"Motherhood," she said.

"My dad loves candy. Now he can't eat it because he'd diabetic," confided Reza to James.

"I like candy okay but it's not really my jones." James was thinking about all the other jones that got him into more trouble than a super-sized bar of chocolate.

"I really like to eat jelly beans in front of the old man because it drives him crazy. He wants to eat sweets so bad, he's practically shaking with rage when I hoover them down."

"Nice."

"You don't torment your parents?"

"Not with sugar." James preferred codeine mixed with tequila or Ecstasy or weed or selling Adderall to fund whatever other torments were on his list.

"My mom says I have his genes and sugar might come back to bite me."  "Are you worried about that?"

Reza poured another sugar packet into his mouth. "He's old and fat. I'm never going to be like him."

Margaret snorted from the driver's seat. "Don't bet on that. It happens quicker than you think."

Both Reza and James rolled their eyes, secure in the knowledge that the future was ordained for other people.

Reza's foot swung back and forth like a metronome, "I feel calmer."

"Good," James said. "I was beginning to think you were having a heart attack."

Reza had the last laugh. A few days later, James found eleven empty sugar packets in his pocket .

Later that night, right before lights out, Reza sloped in to their room from brushing his teeth in only tight whites and a ribbed undershirt. Bowlegged, concave in the chest, he walked like a South Asian cowboy in red Vans mashed down at the heel. If he weighed more than 120 pounds, James would have been surprised.

"Did your mother feed you enough?" James asked him. "You look like someone put you on a starvation diet."

Reza blinked. "My dad's the chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Mamiji would die if she heard you say that. I've always had plenty to eat."

"You're pretty...". James wanted to say 'skeletal' but settled on "...skinny."

"I'm vegetarian," Reza said, like James was clueless. "Pakistani people aren't pig-fat like you Americans." He gestured toward James as if he was lumping him into all the overweight people they'd just seen at Walmart buying huge garbage sacks of Cheetohs and chips.

"Sorreee," James muttered. This cultural sensitivity stuff was harder work than it looked.

"Look on my bright side, Olson," Reza said, a minute later.

"Why?"

"When you're fifty, you've weigh 300 pounds and I'll still be able to wear the same clothes."

"Not on your life," James said, thinking that'll be the day. Judging from Reza's expression, he was thinking the exact same thing.

Decades later they would both be wrong. They'd be fifty pounds heavier but the good news was, they wouldn't remember.

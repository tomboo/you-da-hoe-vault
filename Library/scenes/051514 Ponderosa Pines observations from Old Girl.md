051514 Ponderosa Pines observations from Old Girl

The forest of Ponderosa pines was interspersed with blackened trees from an ancient forest fire. Some of the pines stood tall and straight. Others leaned at crazy angles like they didn't know how to grow upright.

White snow encased branches mix with spiky black boles and gnarled, arthritic arms.

The needles were flat fingers, green with golden tips. Most of the bark was gray with an under-tinge of gold or except on the biggest trees which stretched gold and cinnamon- colorsto the sky.

Death was sleeping all over the snowy landscape.

The tree bark has an overall puzzle pattern. On closer inspection, the bark was composed of a large puzzle pattern. If you scraped your finger deeper, the puzzles continue in ever-smaller pieces with no pattern and a sweetish smell like caramel.

042717 OG opening draft

ONE

Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy when all you had to draw upon were the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Nine young adults --- "YAs" as the staff at Inner Horizons called residents 17- to 20-year-olds --- draggled into the Healing House living room for Process Group, trying not to look like they were hurrying to be seated by 9 AM. Three couches were shoved together in the usual off-kilter circle. Big Paul, who was obsessed with even numbers, sprawled on the love seat.

Darlene banged on the meditation gong. As Head of Therapy, she was usually too high up in the food chain to lead Process Group but today, since Axel had been canned, she was subbing.

The gong set off a flurry of pushing and shaving to get a seat on the Rorschach couch with the black and brown blots. Nobody wanted to get stuck on the Jizz Couch, not since Lydia had been caught banging Axel, her ex-therapist, on it.

Dani Cohen won the couch fight by hip-checking Princess Lydia and flopped into place before Lydia could get there first.

Lydia mouthed "Eat me" at Dani. Then she stretched out full length on the rust and earth-toned plaid, taking the entire sofa for herself. Why should Lydia care about sitting on the wet spot when the bodily fluids were mostly her own?

Welcome to the twice-weekly bitch fest known as Process Group at Inner Horizons Therapeutic, Holistic and Wellness Center for Troubled Teens in Coeur D\'Alene, Idaho.

Old Girl purposely moved her ottoman away from the group so she could face the picture window that looked out on curtain of gray snow. It had started snowing October and was apparently going to keep on snowing until May.

Darlene yawned. "Demerit card to Dani, one to Lydia. See me after Process for paperwork." Then she launched without pause into a breathy introduction of the new black girl like a cheer leader. "Meet the newest member of the Inner Horizons team! Rachel Cathcart! Yay!"

Last night, a tall willowy girl had been frog-marched into Healing House by two ex-cops in matching ski jackets and T*rust in God, Buy a Gun* baseball caps. If your parents brought you to treatment \-- or in Old Girl\'s case, Uncle David and Aunt Peggy, her guardians, it meant you were poor. If you arrived by escort, your mom and dad paid a bundle to fly you to Idaho under personal guard so you couldn\'t run.

Rachel, now sitting next to James Olson on the Rorschach couch, might have been fifteen or forty. She had eggplant-colored skin and a dark eyes that were hollow with fatigue. Her tee shirt read "Give Up the Ghost." On one thin and delicate wrist, raised horizontal scars. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like herself and most of the girls in the program. If the scar had been vertical, she wouldn\'t be here. Something Old Girl had learned the hard way when she was twelve and innocent.

Get prepared, newbie. Heads are going to turn when you walk down a street in lily-white Coeur d\'Alene where the Aryan Nations headquarters is close enough to throw a rock at you. Hope you like your nappy hair because they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife close enough to do damage with will be in the hands of a skinny cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Old Girl ignored long evidence-based blab about the value of processing and contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear hanging from the eaves. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the longest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth that framed the view of the yard. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

The constantly falling snow cut off any hint of the massive Ponderosa pines that ringed Healing House\'s yard. Only dim sulfurous light was able to beat its way through the gloom.

Old Girl was eleven when she made her first suicide attempt. She raided the medicine cabinet at Uncle David\'s and Aunt Peggy\'s house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was that her guardians were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the universe along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed caps and fish oil jammed the shelves. Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's worst way to go?

Now 17, with a year and a half in Adolescents under her belt, Old Girl applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to kill herself. Nothing gross, for example. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Michigan by an Eagle Scout camp counselor ---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water expelled so forcefully it burst a blood vessel in one eye \-- now, all fluids were verboten. Double-ditto efforts that involved road rash, like the kind she got when she fell out of Uncle David's Buick on the way home from middle school. She let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door and learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. It wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken femur and the harrowing experience of having gravel hand-picked out of her cheek bone with tiny forceps.

Now that she was older, her urges to kill herself had receded from all the time to weird moments when she least expected them. She wondered at times if her brain was being rewired while she in the middle of using it. The last time it happened, she remembered thinking a benign thought: "time to buy a new head for my electric toothbrush." The next thing she knew she found herself sticking a fork in the outlet to see if she could fry.

All she could think at those times, the only drumbeat in her head, was \"make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\" If the pain wouldn\'t stop, she had no choice but to open the car door and let gravity take over. Other days, like today, when the drumbeat to die, die, die, subsided to an I, I, I, of low-level pain, she did her homework and finished her chores at Healing House and went to therapy three times with Dr. Hazey, the founder of Inner Horizons. He talked to Old Girl all the time about ways to combat the urge to hoodwink herself out of daylight into perpetual night.

So far, no success.

Lydia Bronfman lost the argument about who had to process first. Lydia was a cutter. She was also a nympho. A bulimic. And the only child from the Bronfman beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the Detroit in the accountability list she was going through which supposed to atone for fucking Axel Friedman. Everybody was mad at Lydia because Axel was the best slow-pitcher on the Inner Horizons soft ball team.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why Lydia was apologizing. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall since she had sex with everybody. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat alone on the loveseat, could count that high.

Lydia was channeling Marilyn Monroe while she listed behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing in a breathy voice. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she was saying. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody was saying."

Darlene rapped her pen on the clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

"How can I take ownership if I don't tell you what I did?" Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by diamond earrings the size of nickels.

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Lydia, was trying to outdo Dani, her nemesis. Dani earned a living as a nude dancer to spite her parents who were evangelicals. The two of them were so self-involved and clueless about anyone else, Old Girl wanted to choke them with the same rope. The problem was there was no rope at Inner Horizons. No rope, no long scarves, no ties for bathrobes, no leather to hold up a pair of pants (the boys whined about this incessantly). Nothing longer than a shoe lace and even those were kept under lock and key.

Old Girl looked down at lumpy bumpy laces tied a million times. She felt a bad case of captive rage coming on. Captive rage was like captor rage, except more vicious. When you had captor rage, there was some dim glimmer of understanding that Charlene, the night duty, or Margaret, the day supervisor or Bruce, the van driver, was making \$8 bucks an hour and didn\'t want to be at Inner Horizons any more than you did. But with got captive rage, all that blame was aimed at yourself.

Lydia had met Old Girl on her first day of lock up with the phrase, \"Welcome to You-Da-Ho.\"

Udahoe? Old Girl was so stupid then.

\"No, You-Da-HO.\" Lydia emphasized the last syllable. \"You da crazy fucked up ho who fucked up by getting yourself locked up in bum-fuck Idaho with a bunch of crazy fucks you\'ll never get away from.\"

Even at fifteen, she thought the joke was a lame but people used it so much, it turned into an ear worm that couldn\'t be shaken.

Now Lydia was telling a story about how she\'d gotten over on a police officer with a blowjob. Her short black curl bobbed enthusiastically on her childishly thin neck. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene made a note. Flipped to a clean page on the clipboard. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist's shake up after Axel\'s departure.

Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved from Ads to YAs. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized head of Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from D-Day (shortened from Despair Dayon April 15, 2015). A Yale degree in psychiatry was framed on Hazey's wall that said he specialized in \"Youth and Adolescent Behavioral Psychiatry.\" The year 1986 showed up a few times on the raft of diplomas she read on his office wall one day when she was too wound up to sit through her session. That meant Hazey had to be what... almost fifty? No wonder he was practically senile.

By then, James Olson, the lanky blond surfer from Malibu, was talking in a low monotone to the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd said in one of those tense, shame-fests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get wake up.

"I traded my Revos for the candy," said James.

Then Darlene wanted to know how he could afford Jelly Bellies on \$5-a-week snack allowance.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high. Darlene tried to get him to rat out the person he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, his roommate and a meth-addicted motor-mouth, had supplied the candy because Reza's New York Jets cap had the Revos hanging off the back of it. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. After three months without running, YAs had the \"privilege\" of taking 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks on the trade. All James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy on his weekly Family Call that he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex. Ching-ching-ching. A galaxy of Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, a drip of moisture beaded up and rolled down the icicle to the edge of the eaves. It hung there as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions.

Time was elastic at Inner Horizons. You were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards if you screwed up. The clock ran forward for a few weeks but if you earned a demerit, say, for being late for Process Group or failed to take the trash out or you fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed, or you refused to participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during therapy, the clock would turn around and run backward and taunt you as it ran. Old Girl had had a bitter experienced looking forward to a weeklong trip home to Aunt Peggy and Uncle David. Just a when she was close to getting sprung, the crazy clock rewound and she found herself \"unsafe without supervision\" and hadn\'t stepped out of Idaho since.

Maybe she could have accepted it if she had known the clock was broken. But the fact that the clock ran fast sometimes and slow at others, and only once in a while took god-awful leaps backwards made her hopeless with despair.

Outside, the wall thermometer outside now read 28 degrees. An hour before, it was 23 degrees. Yippee! Idaho's definition of spring.

At breakfast, she'd overheard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the fix-it guy to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery.

How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The insistence in Margaret's loud voice made the timing seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who seemed to pick up trash whenever he felt like it. He stunk and he drove a rackety ancient truck that stacked with double rows of barrels that smelled just as bad. Maybe melting was the key. The icicle dripped moisture during the day when it warmed up, then refroze into lethal weapons at night.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her suicide tries ---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straight copper hair fan out like a sun storm in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process of dreads had squeezed the color out of her hair. Now it looked dull as cardboard. Lack of blood would lighten her freckles; she supposed. Would it also flatten out the bump in her nose?

Usually she covered her strange proportions with baggy jeans or dark shapeless sweats. Her long legs made her look like a stork with the heavy breast of a turkey. The Fedora hat she wore to look hip wasn't very practical when it was freezing. She would have to carry it in her backpack and wear the black, pilling ski hat with the earflaps until the last minute.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job.

Margaret would have to wield the scissors. Anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Old Girl was so tired. She had a hard time sleeping because her mind kept itself busy fabricating scenes of her death. She liked scenarios that were as plot driven as mysteries. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Miu-Miu dresses. Weather varied between dark and creep-meister or sometimes gray as grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she imagined a fishing boat that steamed on oblivious to a body falling out of the sky. Tragedy didn't always have to slap you in the face.

How warmer it had to get to make the icicle do its work? If she watched the temperature during Process Group twice a week and checked it before dinner every day, maybe she'd get an early read on the melting progress. Always the problem with real life. So little you could control.

"Old Girl, wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice, cut into her daydream. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle," Darlene said.

Old Girl didn\'t want to come back in the circle. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally wanted to be alone. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and vague murmurs to get well, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, the new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?" said Darlene.

She was reminded of the pleasures of double homicide-suicide as she swiveled dutifully back to the fringes of the group.

On the bright side, she added the number 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Time thinned until Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time five more people processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism . If it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it. Then it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged her to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing.

"Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

The curtain of streaming snow was now so thick it cut off any hint of the blue-black wall of fir trees that ringed the yard. The sun hung out there somewhere. Too weak and wan to do more than ooze sulfurous yellow light through the swirling flakes.

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced outside looking for some escape, then up at the ceiling. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's had aged her. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to make herself smaller. She opened her mouth like a fish.

Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills.

She stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get Bruce!" she shouted. Then, pointing at Lydia, she shouted, "Call 9-1-1!"

Could James feel the new girl\'s bolt of electricity like she could? It felt like she was being electrocuted by proxy and it scared her, this feeling of polar opposites connected. Her white hands gripped Rachels slim black upper arms with an iron grip. Underneath her fingrs she couldfeel bones as delicate as green tree limbs but pulsing with alien life.

The jolting and sparking was deeply unnerving. It made Old Girl want to run at the same time that her hands were stapled to Rachel\'s body in the act of being kidnapped by runaway life.

Jesus, she was thinking. Get me out of here!

From the stricken look in James blue eyes as he held onto the girl\'s shins, she understood that he was feeling the same awe and horror and terror. James could no more disconnect than she could.

Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck. How can I hold the new girl to this earth when I can barely hold myself with all the strength I\'ve got?

Up to that moment, running had always been in Old Girl\'s mind as a fuzzy possibility. She was exactly like every other resident at Inner Horizons. She hated and loathed the Program and woke up every morning believing she couldn\'t stand it one more day, then woke the next morning and saw that she was still here. The constant psychobabble about self- actualization and self-denial and self-development and self-knowledge and self education and self-disgust made her acutely aware that the only way to save her sorry self was to run.

No more shilly-shallying. Run tonight.

Shilly-shallying\--where had that come from? Shilly-shallying was something her mother would have said if she wasn\'t now a greasy spot on the railroad tracks with Dad and baby Gabe after being shoved into a train by a geriatric driver who mistook his gas pedal for a brake. No shilly-shallying there.

The senior citizen had been going 45 miles per hour when he crashed into them from the rear. The train was going 50 when it hit them on the tracks. There was nothing left but gristle and bone when it came time to bury them, according to a matter-of-fact Aunt Peggy who conveyed this nugget of information on the phone to her best friend when she thought Old Girl was out cold with a sedative on the couch.

Now her attention was back on Rachel\'s surprisingly firm biceps. The dark backs of her hands with palms as pink as rabbit ears thumped on the floor. James had a white-knuckled grip on her shins and her heels beat their own crazy tattoo.

Shilly-shallying over. Go now.

\#

Darlene and Bruce, the driver, scurried around with Margaret directing traffic until they got Rachel loaded into the van. Darlene thought they should drive her to the emergency room at Kootenai General which was faster than waiting for an ambulance to drive 15 miles out to Healing House, then drive the same 15 miles back before they got her to a doctor.

In all the hustle and hoo-ha relating to the fit, Darlene forgot her purse.

Old Girl spotted it next to the wingback chair where Darlene had been sitting at Process Group. She reached to grab it but Lydia scooped up the bag first.

The little shit!

In the top was a wallet. A green corner peeked out of it. A twenty! Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia plucked the bill and palmed it in one smooth motion while calling out loudly, \"Darlene! Your purse!\"

Damn that Lydia. Always a step ahead when it came to herself. Old Girl could have used the money to add to her minuscule stash of cash she had painstakingly over months amassed a grand total of 37 dollars and 51 cents. She\'d sold her North Face jacket worth \$250 bucks for \$25 to an Indian girl in her English class who looked like she needed it more than Old Girl did. How \$36. 58 was going to get her to Seattle, she had no idea.

Darlene rushed back in the living room and took the bag, thanking Lydia profusely. Lydia smiled sweetly, flashing Old Girl a middle finger behind her back. She moved past James, bumped him on the ass, then slid into the bathroom off the kitchen.

Old Girl sighed. Another sexcapade in the making. Did James and Lydia think people were blind to their hook-ups? Apparently.

James was good looking male except when he was rocking the man bun. Blond. Ocean blue eyes. A carefully cultivated surfer dude look that was hard to maintain in Idaho where everyone wore puffy down and wool hats yanked down to the eyeballs. But Old Girl felt nothing when she looked at him. She existed in a deep freeze, completely insulated from human warmth. No interest in body-to-body touching what so ever. All feeling\--good and bad\--had fled with her family. Absence didn\'t make the heart grow fonder, in her experience; it made her heart grow so colder until it had turned into a block of ice.

**Find a place for?**

The guilt of watching Mom\'s and Dad\'s life insurance get eaten up by treatment fees, followed by the drain on Uncle David\'s and Aunt Peggy\'s savings, and their ban on family vacations and her awareness that no college money was being set aside for her cousins ate at her. What was wrong with her that she couldn\'t fix herself? Who was she to suck up money that was supposed to pay for trips to Disney World and fund her cousins\' chance at a better life?

If she wasn't alive, she wouldn\'t be responsible for \$120,000 of fees for her first year at Inner Horizons. Uncle David joked that they had already bought Dr. Hazey two new Mercedes or was it Range Rovers? Which one was more expensive for the good doctor\'s well-rounded butt?

It wasn't bad enough that she was ashamed that her paltry life dragged on and on when her mother\'s and father\'s and baby Gabe\'s lives had been deleted as easily as a backspace on a key board. Now she had the added guilt of fucking up Uncle David's and Aunt Peggy's and their kids to pile on.

Healing House was actually 15 miles outside of Couer d'Alene. The property bordered on the Kootenai National Forest which gave it a view of nothing but trees. Their next door neighbor on the other side was the dump. YouDaHo if you thought the view in Idaho was worth writing home about.

Healing House was also a lot more beat up than Calm Cottage. Dr. Hazey had started his empire with the one story ranch house that had been added on to a couple times. Old Girl assumed that Hazey chose a ranch house to prevent his patients from jumping out and running away from their fees.

The living area separated two sleeping wings that angled away from each other. The wings were named for old Indian tribes: girls lived in the Flat Head; boys slept in the Black Feet wing. It took about one nanosecond for the wing names to devolve to the Fat Asses and the Black Heads. Somewhere in Dr. Hazey's small clatch of repurposed residences cum dormitories around town, he had a manor home named for the Shoshones where presumably the Show Ponies horsed around.

Fat Asses weren\'t supposed to fraternize with Black Heads, and vice versa. Residents ate together, processed together, recreated together, and slept by themselves. God forbid you actually got close to anyone at Inner Horizons.

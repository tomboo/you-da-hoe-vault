030618 raccoon replotting issues

\--Chase\'s death/Margaret shoots raccoons has to come before the fire

\--The fire is set by Rusty: benighted effort to show Ginny how cool he looks in his new firemen\'s jacket

\--The raccoons are lit up by the blaze. The red light of the leaping flames is joined by a crisscrossing of flashlight beams. The astounded fire volunteers sweep their beams like crazy theater lighting people who can\'t aim the spotlight until one of them lands on a small masked bandit face in a day-Glo yellow bloom.

\--need to recast fire scene, determine its purpose and POV

Currently the fire scene is told from OG\' perspective. She witnesses James wrapping Binny up in a blanket and in a little while, they take Leah into their warm and OG feels a pull toward their body heat.

OG felt something give in her heart, like a tiny wishbone crack. At her back, cold pressed in on her and seemed to pull her away from their body heat. Her legs were freezing in her thin pajamas and the puffy down jacket Charlene had shoved at her was too small to zip closed over her chest. Gabe\'s floppy-dog-eared hat was pulled down to her eyebrows and she could barely see past the yarn fluff.

Then it seemed as if the cold wasn\'t pressing her away, it was pushing her toward their circle of warmth. Was that it? Or was their warm \-- punctuated by snickers and grab-ass giggles\--was drawing her towards them?

For an instant, she felt a searing almost heart-stopping desire to flee from the cold and duck under James\'s arm into the huddle with them. She took a step forward and then Leah\'s kind of sidewinded around James on the other side, and he automatically opened his arm like a gate and she snuck under into the circle, nearly invisible in the scrum because she was so short and Ginny and James were practically nose-to-nose with each other. The longing to be in the circle was so strong, it nearly took her breath away.

Transition needed

\"What the fuck?!!\" James, who only had eyes for Ginny, shifted his attention to the far side of the yard. The big Ponderosa tree seemed to have sprouted a neon Christmas bouquet. His blanket-draped arm lifted, revealing Leah\'s skinny knees sticking out of improbably high boots, in a point.

\"Holy shit!\"

\"What the hell?\"\
\"Fucking coons?\"

All over the yard, voices rose out of the crowd. Old Girl\'s eyes took in a cluster of radioactively bright blossoms silhouetted against night-black tree limbs. A tiny masked face peered out of a Pepto-bismol pink blossom, and she realized it was joined by other masked faces in stark relief in the center of radioactive orange and neon yellow and fluorescent green splashes of color all over the Ponderosa like a case of nuclear measles. Flames leaping from the hole the firemen had chopped in the roof tinged black-and-white striped tails in violent violet. Hisses split the night with lavender-white fangs.

\"For Christ\'s sake,\" someone breathed.

Then flashlight beams started to crisscross the tree as volunteer fire fighter after firefighter found their Maglites and played light across a pissed-off raccoon family dotted throughout the boughs like radioactive ornaments.

A metallic green haunch. A sun-spot yellow star-bursted muzzle. One bushy tail the tenderly violent shade of violet. Feral masked eyes stared down at the yard in shades not found in nature.

Old Girl\'s forward motion toward the circle of James and Ginny\'s arms halted. She felt as if time teetered between a desire to move toward warmth and a sense of shock and awe that she was witnessing a strange otherworldly sight of blasted creatures in every color from a chemical vat.

Before she made a concrete decision, Old Girl found herself involuntarily moving toward the circle of warmth. The scratchy-scratchy sound of frozen snow crunched underneath her feet. \"What the fuck?!\" someone shouted.

James was pointing at the Ponderosa tree with an arm that was lifting the dragging blanket to reveal Leah\'s skinny knees sticking out of high fashion boots. He was joined by more pointing, louder shouts. Her attention was drawn to the tallest Ponderosa pine in the yard as it was lit by criss-crossing Maglies from a crowd of fire fighters drawn to the spectacle.

The big black tree spouted what looked like scattered radioactive blooms all over it. Dayglo orange, nuclear purple, blue Transyvanian ice, cotton-candy pink, neon yellow and an orangish red not found in nature lit up the dark boughs. Nuclear holocaust Christmas!

Old Girl turned away from the blanket huddle. She moved toward the Ponderosa to get a better look and by then, more volunteer fire fighters were lighting up the boughs with their flash light beams.

Centered in one nuclear purple splotch, a furry masked face snarled and hissed in a high pitch screech. \"Coons,\" someone breath. Then the word \"raccoons\" seemed to stutter around the yard, as more fire fighters took up the call and more kids in makeshift blankets and thin pajamas took up the call.

\"Raccoon.\"

\"Raccoons.\"

\"Fucking rodents,\" someone shouted. \"They\'ve been paint-balled!\"

\"Pain balled?\"

\"Fucking plastered,\" someone else shouted.

A shout of laughter replaced the awe and whispers with a kind of squirrely, crazed glee that spread among the crowd like a virus.

Old Girl still felt cold. Freezing, really. The sight of the radioactive raccoons in their paint-balled beauty broke her impulse to move into James and Ginny\'s circle of warmth. Forever after, she would remember the intense flare of longing to join with them in their blanket huddle that was broken by the improbable sight of the other-worldly raccoons. She stopped where she stood in the crunching snow and just stared at a sight that she would remember the rest of her life.

In a night of strangeness\--waking up to the choking smoke, rocketing out of bed, grabbing up her backpack and Gabe\'s dog-eared hat in complete panic, rousing both the girl\'s wing and the boy\'s wing with shouts of \"Get out!\", the crazy raccoons were the memory that never left her.

One moment she had been longing with all her heart to join the circle of James\'s and Ginny\'s warm \--they had just taken Leah into their huddle\-- and in the next instant, she was stopped in her tracks, paralyzed by the spreading calls of \"Raccoons! Look at the coons!\"

They were everywhere. Dotted among the boughs of the huge black Ponderosa like radioactive blooms of pure color, she saw Day-Glo orange, nuclear green, fluorescent pink, violent purple andpuce never seen in nature. Highlighted in the glowing blotches, feral masked bandit face hissed or snarled in high pitched whistles.

Everybody at Healing House knew the story of Margaret\'s paintball gun and how she had singlehandedly torpedoed Dr. Hazey\'s chances with the Certification Review Board from Olympia. But the volunteer firefighter crowd weren\'t privy to Margaret\'s prowess with a paintball gun.

Margaret had made lots of direct hits. Tails glowed in orange-and black Halloween stripes. Shoulders stained in Pepto-Bismol chemical pink. One feral face was silhouetted in a purple pansy bloom of nuclear nightmare purple. If you stood back and admired the effect, it was like looking at a bouquet of furry snarls blossoming in radioactive colors out of the pitch-black night.

Old Girl was surprised by the sharpness of her desire to join them. She had an aching feeling at her back from the cold pressing in and there was an irresistible pull at her front to move away from the cold and darkness into their circle of warmth.

And then the impulse to connect was broken by a spreading murmur of \"Raccoons! Fucking coons!\"

There was a lot of smoke and fire fighter chaos but the actual flames were soon identified and stamped out. A gaggle of volunteers got up on the roof and stomped around and inspected the chimney to make sure no errant sparks were hiding in the beams.

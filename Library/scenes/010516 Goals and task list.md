**PRIORITY WRITING GOAL**

Rewrite "Crazy" novel incorporating input from Mountford/Fitzgerald edit by April 15.

**Writing and Editing Tasks**

1.  Address the time confusion and make the clock clear to the reader.

Create a chronology that locks all the events on a time line.

2.  Rethink plotting to increase tension and plant Rusty, Hazey, Old Girl and Margaret's plans early on to ratchet up suspense

> \--OG's decision to run
>
> \--Margaret's plan to extort a raise/new job from Hazey
>
> \--Hazey's plan to get certified & expand so he can hire new COO
>
> \--Rusty's plan to kidnap Rachel

3.  Cut Margaret's segments to balance her time on stage

4.  Address Lydia & Lorenzo relationship to figure out why it isn't working; think through how to make Lydia sicker and to push plot forward

5.  Identify backstory chunks and handle elegantly or cut

6.  Address episodic quality of the middle by linking causality to rising consequences

7.  Address snarky voice issue so that Old Girl, James, Margaret & Hazy all have their own speaking style

8.  Rethink fire and certification review board consequences so that each makes a cause-and-effect cascade.

9.  Rewrite raccoon scene or cut

10. Look for inconsistencies in OG & Rachel's roommate status & other time inconsistencies that confuse reader

11. Consolidate Rachel's character to simplify \# of voices.

12. Research current drug and weed use. Try all.

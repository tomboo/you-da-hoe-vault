011519 Reza in front of the candy shelves

Reza stood in front of a large array of candy spread out on floor to ceiling shelves. His body was in constant, nervy motion. He wanted the candy, had to have it, but couldn't settle down long enough to choose a purchase. It was like he was caught between wanting the candy and not wanting the candy because his selection would always be the wrong thing and it wouldn't satisfy him. It was the way James felt about drugs.

"It's not an entrance exam," James finally said.

"Might as well be," Reza answered. "When you want everything and can't have any of it."

"You've got five bucks. Pick one."

"That's it. I can't just have one. I have to have all of them."

James got the idea that Reza was revealing something germane to himself but what?

"It'll just make me sick," Reza said, turning away.

"Are you diabetic?"

"No."

"Then what makes you sick?"

"Jesus, forget it. Go distract that guy at the counter. I'm going to steal some cigarettes."

James went up and paid for his Baby Ruth and chalked up Reza's indecision to his typical lunacy. Who could understand Reza if he didn't understand himself?

Reza's hand hovered over a Baby Ruth, then moved on to the Skittles. Then it wandered over to the Snickers bars. Back to the Bubble Yum.

"Come on, Margaret's waiting. We gotta go."

"I can't decide."

"Jesus Reza, just put some sugar packets in your pocket and then you don't have to decide. Your body treats all sugar the same."

Reza immediately brightened. "Hey, that's a good idea. It's all sugar, right? Let your body figure it out and then you don't have to choose."

James was kidding. Now he was amazed to see Reza, seemingly calmed, walk over to the coffee tables and lift a handful of sugar packs from the dispenser. In the van, he watched Reza hoover them down, one by one.

"What?" Reza said.

"How can you eat straight sugar?"\
"You suggested it. Plus I still have my \$5 and what do you have?" Reza gestured to the empty Babe Ruth wrapper in James's hand.

It was then that James understood that he knew zero about what made Reza---or anybody for that matter \-\-- tick. Reza dropped the empty packets to the floor and Margaret said, "Pick that up before I make you eat it."

Eyes in the back of her head. Did becoming a parent put them there or were you genetically pre-selected for it.

Reza had the last laugh. James found ten empty sugar packets in his jacket pocket a few days later.

"I need a pick me up." Reza's tone was whiny.

"Jesus, you might as well eat straight sugar. Go over there and grab some." James nodded at the small coffee area with a few tables and chairs near the coffee bar.

To his amusement, Reza opened packet after packet of sugar in the van, pouring one after the other down his throat.

"Not bad," Reza said. "Kind of boring. I like the texture of Skittles better. They're chewier."

"Why didn't you buy some? You were fondling them a minute ago."

"I wasn't fondling. I couldn't decide."

"So you kyped the sugar packets instead."

"You told me to."

"I was kidding, numnutz."

Reza poured the last packet into his mouth. Let the paper fall to the floor. Margaret said, without turning away from the wheel, "Pick that up or I'll make you swallow it."

"How'd you get that third eye?" Reza asked her.

"Motherhood," she said.

"They're not bad," Reza said. "And I feel calmer." His foot was jiggling like a superheated metronome.

"Good," James said. "I was beginning to think you were having a heart attack."

"You wish," Reza said.

Boy howdy, James said.

"Don't spend your money then. It's all sugar, numnutz. Go over and get some sugar packets. Let your body decide."

Carly natters on as Gary drives until in a drowsing state, OG spots a sign for the Idaho State Line. Fifty feet beyond it is a Welcome to Washington sign.

The drone of Carly\'s voice softens, then dims like a star that winks out while she\'s transported to another car ride, another voice drifting in and out of consciousness.

Aunt Peggy, who talks when she\'s nervous, and God knows, she and uncle David have been his tense piano wires, the whole trip from Peoria, Illinois, to Coeur d\'Alene, Idaho.

\"Oh look, honey. Welcome to Idaho.\" Peggy points to a seemingly handmade sign made out of weathered boards, cut out in the long rectangle as if a bear has chomped the right quadrant a couple times. \"We\'re almost there!\" Peggy says this brightly in a strangled and high voice that tells Angela as she has been known until then, everything it can about how relieved her aunt and uncle are going to be when they leave her \"alive\" at inner horizons. \"At least we got her that far,\" Peggy\'s to implies while Angela in the backseat, cause as far from alive as the living dead.

The green highway sign has an outline of the state of Idaho. It still looks like a grizzly chomped the right corner off, though this sign is poly coated green with pale reflective, white outlines that square off the angles and corners that used to look like bite marks.

\"Switch to Pacific standard time\" is written below the state which somehow reminds the new Angela that she\'ll have to stop calling it Idaho now that the real Idaho is receding in the rearview mirror like the past.

Her time in Idaho is passed, just as her family has passed, and yet it\'s present as they speak deeper into green Washington away from the Sea Brown Hills and patches of melting snow and the rising red sap in the river beds with willows.

Ho\'s passed. Mom and dad and Gabe are passed. PASSED. Yet all of them are just as present as they reaching Ponderosa and see Brown Hills dotted with patches of melting snow and Bitterbrush among the sage.

Has this state of mind that\'s Idaho also passed? Hard to say, though Angela\'s shoulders feel lightened of some burden and her heart, where she feels her family crowded in a tight space, tingles as if it\'s ready to ease open. Only time will tell if the living dead phase is banished by Hayes\'s invisible voodoo that released something in her body that had hijacked her mind.

If mom\'s sister, Gracie takes her in, let her live with her in Wallingford. Maybe she can go to the University of Washington and take the classes and maybe learn to write what she feels instead of bottling up the bad experiences like poisons. Sure bottling it up would save you in the short run, but what was the good of that when she learned to dismay that whatever you didn\'t process it you up from the inside out?

It wouldn\'t be the first time she realized that you a hoe -- both being the hoe and living in the\' HO with the other HOESM -- had taught her something, even if it would take years to figure out what.

She turned to Carly and addressed herself both to her silent husband and the woman who did all the talking for them. She said, \"my name is Angela, but my mom and dad always called me Angie.\"

\"Oh, that\'s sweet!\" Carly cried.

Yes, it is, Angela thought putting old girl and the shorten form OG into the Lexon of old Idaho words along with pie hole and \"cat bath\" and \"chop my ass.\" In case you ever wanted to bring it back with the smell of Margaret cinnamon rolls these reminders were in our notebooks.

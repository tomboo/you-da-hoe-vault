10062025 Fire scene writes plus synopsis description

OG wants to warm up with James and Rachel but can't bring herself to ask to share the quilt James dragged off his bed. Lydia, clad in sleep shorts dotted with fluffy lambs, wiggles into their cuddle, leaving OG out in the cold. The cold and lonely feeling gets worse when a great horned owl swoops in and snatches OG's Snoopy hat at the moment a fire fighter spots a neon raccoon face atop the Ponderosas. People ooh and ahhh at the explosion of neon stars with hissing creatures at their centers as as more firefighters ply their flashlights over the trees like klieg lights. Only OG knows that Margaret's jihad on the pests has set off the nuclear bloom of hisses and yowls, a sight creates a surprising kind of warmth that OG will never forget. The hat snatched by the hunting owl is long gone feels the loss keenly until good old Margaret finds the discarded hat in the driveway when she comes in to work.

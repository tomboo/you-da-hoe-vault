08122025 OG grips holds onto an electrical storm

I want to think about how OG reacts to Rachel's epileptic fit that seizes upon her like a kidnapper.

I am groping for a connect. Maybe that is the solution: it's like electricity coursing its errant way through Rachel's body seizes OG too. She's "holding on for dear life" trying to keep Rachel in the room, while James at her head holds tight to her too. She doesn't want to let the girl go in case she leaves her body so far behind, she can't find her way back.

She's never had the experience of having her own body take over and make its own animal depends like it does in child birth or when the body shuts down at death. She's only familiar with the experience of having the living snatched away. She wants more than anything to keep the girl alive and in the room with them but she has no control over the mysterious process. Rachel leaves her body despair OG's efforts to keep her grounded; then, when she suddenly returns to her body, OG can't understand where she went. How could you be AWOL in your own self?

Unclear what I am groping for. It has to do with my own fascination with how the body decides to let go. I'm having trouble articulating what OG feels so deeply. She can feel electricity zapping and zipping in a crazy arc--- that fries the girl out of her consciousness while uncontrollable random movements take over. The experience of being sent somewhere far away and then jerked back into her body is unnerving. She's taken over by an electrical storm. OG has no power to help her or hold her in the room. Another power takes over but what?

It's like she meets with the inefficient le. We have no control. People fly off the face of this earth and even though we're hanging on to them, they slip free of us lightning that isn't grounded.

112614 Old Girl is Touched\-- PP2 scene

This was not Old Girl's usual wanting and hoping and scheming to die. This was garden-variety flu. Or hanta virus. Norovirus. If she was lucky, maybe cholera.

In her fever-chilled dreams, a distant siren howled like a hungry baby. The mwah-MWAH-mwah-MWAH worked its way under the blankets and the longer she tried to ignore it, the louder it yowled.

She gave up on sleep and peered through a crack in the blind. She wasn't crazy. A red fire truck was rumbling up the snow-packed driveway to Healing House.

She clawed the heaviest Pendleton blanket off the bed and wrapped it around her shoulders, Indian-style. By the time she crept down the hall, using the wall to steady her, firefighters were boiling through the entryway.

All she could think in her addled state was that the arsonist was back. She couldn't smell a damn thing through the clog in her sinuses. Where was the smoke? The axes? The hoses? Why weren't they herding people out?

A dozen or so firefighters milled around the living room getting in the way of two men who seemed to be trussing a boy on the carpet, packing him like a sausage.

A fireman herked a white sack over a pair of splayed legs. Adidas- striped feet, black hipster-skinny legs, a Bard College sweatshirt that had seen better days, disappeared under white. Old Girl glimpsed a white angular face with a wispy van Dyke on its chin. Nobody she knew. Old Girl had witnessed some weird stuff on the plaid couch that was always front-and-center in all kinds of peer group shit, but seeing the face of young man disappear into a body bag had to be the weirdest.

Margaret was standing with her back to Old Girl, being hugged and patted by a firefighter. She kept stuttering. "I tried... tried---...." All the words came out in a rush. "But his heart wouldn't restart!" The bearded firefighter kept up the pat-a-pat-pats on Margaret's's broad back. The red man-sized plaid shirt she wore had somehow rucked up, calling attention to a square and motherly ass.

"How long did you do compressions?" the fireman asked.

"Twenty? -- maybe twenty-five minutes?" Margaret blew her nose into his handkerchief. "I called in to dispatch, then rolled him onto the floor."

"He was on the couch when you found him?"

"Laid out cold when I came in from those fucking raccoons."

The front door was propped open. A cold breeze from the snow-drifted lawn dusted the entry with a sprinkling of ice crystals. Old Girl felt the fingers of chill.

She must have moaned. Margaret's head jerked off the firefighter's shoulder. "Oh, honey, you shouldn't be out of bed!"

She made for Old Girl, crying, "Don't come in here! You don't need to see this," as a white oblong shape rolled out the door on a gurney like some mystery that could never be explained.

Margaret's meat-packer arms went out and the next thing Old Girl knew---she, who never allowed herself to be held, who always shied away from contact---Old Girl found herself folded onto Margaret's bosom. With her nose pushed into the vee between Margaret's size Double-Ds, she smelled Tide and wet dog.

Old Girl listened to the steady lub-lub-lub of Margaret's heart, amplified by the great breasts pressed up against Old Girl's ears like two flesh-and-blood conchs. Instead of feeling smothered, as she expected, she was shocked at how safe she felt. Margaret's body seemed to fuel a crack in the frozen lake of Old Girl's heart.

Old Girl's feet had turned into ice blocks on the slate floor, but she leaned into Margaret's pillowy heat anyway, away from the cold wind blasting Idaho's winter through her nighty. She let Margaret pat her cheek with warm, chapped hands.

121518 End of Margaret Bitchslaps Ned

"Touch Lydia again and I'm calling the cops."

"You do that lady. They'll protect me from you," said the cowboy with some well-deserved bitterness.

The baseball bat had rolled under the van. In the low angled, late afternoon sun, James could see a gleam of metal in the side view mirror. Only a pussy hit with a metal bat. Wood was the only thing James liked. Should he mention it or let sleeping bats lie? The guy was hunched over on one side like he was protecting his kidney. Let it lie, he supposed.

"Where's my Louisville Slugger?" Cowboy asked. My ass, James thought. Cheapo metal with a cheap ass ring-a-ding-ding sound. Not that it wouldn't have hurt if he'd hit Margaret with it.

"What the heck's in that thing?" James pointed to the fluffy bag now occupying most of the well between the seats.

Margaret said, "A pipewrench."

"You're kidding me."

"There's a leaky fauce in the girl's bathroom," she said. "I need to fix it."

"Are you going to report me?" Lydia's voice warbled from the back of the van where she'd sequestered herself as far away as she could get.

"I think I'll make you fix the damn faucet," she said. "I'm too worn out to fill out all that paper work."

They rode in silence to Healing House. James had sense enough to keep his mouth shut. So did Lydia. James even offered to carry Margaret's purse into the house. It must have weighed twenty pounds.

09132025 Youdahoe Updated Pitch Notes

Told in the stye of the Jackson Brodie mysteries, the heroine of this branded narrative is OG, an 18-year-old girl who's lost her family to a train crash. All OG wants is to kill herself but unfortunately, she's locked up in rural Idaho at a psychiatric treatment center for affluent teens which keeps interfering with her plans.

Told in the style of Atkinson's Jackson Brodie mysteries, this braided narrative follows 18-year-old OG's harrowing journey out of grief back to life while locked up in rural Idaho, at a dysfunctional psychiatric treatment center. Inner Horizons is run by Dr. Hazey, the drug-addled founder, is writing drug prescriptions for kids who are no longer there while the real psychopath of the story, Rusty the garbage man, acquires an unhealthy addiction to Rachel, OG's new roommatel.

Have you ever wondered what the difference is between garden-variety teenage craziness and true mental illness? *Youdahoe* is both a rural place ten miles outside of Coeur D;Alene, Idaho, as well as a state of mind where all the young adults locked up together at Inner Horizons, a dysfunctional psychiatric treatment center, must learn to survive. OG, the suicidally depressed main character, wants more than anything to join her dead family after a fiery train crash except that she wakes up to every attempt to off herself to find herself frustratingly alive. Every young adult patient at Inner Horizons is faced with the same dilemma: how to live through the worst nightmares of their young live and live to tell the tale. Loveless Lydia, heiress to a liquor fortune, trades money for any kind of sex; James, a Malibu basketball phenom, can't admit he killed a passenger in his car while high so he is stuck rewriting a Accountability Letter for life; Margaret, the poorly paid Day Supervisor, thinks she's the sanest person on the Program, until Dr. Hazey sends her to his home to retrieve a black shoe to replace the brown shoe he wore to work, and discovers a surprisingly colorful cavalcade of psychotropic drugs he's been prescribing to kids who left the Program long ago.

Youdahoe is a darkly comic novel with an ultimately hopeful trajectory through both garden-variety insanity and serious mental health issues. It traverses the valley of grief to hard-earned insight about how everyone has to learn to survive this fragile life.

OG, the 18-year-old heroin, no longer wants to live after losing her family in a fiery train crash but every time she tries to off herself, she wakes up still alive at Inner Horizons until she makes the decision to run. OG'S newest roommate Rachel, a suicide survivor and a new mother whose out-of-wedlock baby was stolen from her by her parents, attracts the attentions of Rusty, the garbage collector, who outfits a container and plans to kidnap the black girl so he'll have something to love; Rachel befriends James, a gifted college basketball player from Malibu, and talks him out of of killing his crazy motor-mouth roommate Reza who wants to bombard him with every detail and chemical equation he employed the first time he made meth and blew up his New York family's home in the Hamptons.

All Inner Horizons, patients are trying to figure out the how to come to terms with their choices while the Program's founder of the Program, Dr Aloyisus Hazey, distracts himself from the stress of running a psychiatric treatment center for young adults by prescribing himself drugs meant for kids who are no longer enrolled. Margaret, the Day Supervisor, tries to be the sane one of the bunch by keeping the nuts-management in check while providing the care and love that the patients she loves so desperately need.

Youdahoe is a darkly comic exploration of insanity and dysfunction that is surprisingly hopeful about the crazy, fragile world we all must learn to survive.

OG, the main character, doesn't want to live after losing her family in a train crash but everything at Inner Horizons, the crazy, dysfunctional psychiatric treatment center she's locked up in, thwarts her efforts to die until she makes the decision to run away.

Her new roommate, Rachel, attracts the unwanted attentions of Rusty, the garbage collector, who decides to kidnap her. Rachel befriends James, the Malibu college basketball player, who can't finish his Accountability Letter because it's impossible to admit he killed a passenger when he was out of his mind on weed and Red Bull laced with vodka.

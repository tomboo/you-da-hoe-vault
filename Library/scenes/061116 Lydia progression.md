Unfortified with anything except Seven for Mankind jeans, a Miu-Miu blouse and a Balenciaga

tote, she meets her mother in her hollowed out, empty state. She has an out-of-body experience of shrinking and getting smaller in her chair until she begins to believe that she's not even in the room.

Her mother wants to take her out of the Program so that she can take control of Lydia's maintenance allowance and live on her until her money problems get solved with another marriage. Lydia doesn't want to stay at the Program but she also doesn't want to let her mother use her so she decides to thwart her by staying put.

Lydia had a vision of her mother's larger, new Balenciaga bag swallowing her up and turning her into a bag shaped block that would be left on the luggage closet's shelf until someone remembered to retrieve her.

"So I guess you're stuck with me," she told Dr. Hazey. The sound of her mother's heels clicked down the hall as if tracked by a radioactive counter.

Hazey was peering out his window, seemingly mesmerized by the frozen white expanse of the frozen over lake that was pushing closed a black circle of open water. Inside the circle a flock of spinning coots chuckled and churned in the rapidly diminishing space. "That's good," he said. "I think."

He seemed to be asking a question.

"I thought you'd be happy that you weren't losing my fees," Lydia said.

"I think your mother is more unhappy at losing your fees than I would be." The loud bark of the entrance door punctuated his ambiguous smile.

"She'll get over it. She always does."

"Hmmm. Is that typical? Her using you for access to money?"

"Sometimes. She isn't too good with money, like she said."

"Actually, I think she's pretty good at getting it when she needs it." The coots on the edge of the circle somehow managed to work their way into the inner circle so that the ones on the outside in the cold could depend on getting warm. Lydia wasn't sure how the system worked but she thought it was pretty elegant.

"Just out of curiosity, how big is your monthly maintenance allowance?"

"They used to call it my allowance but they changed it into a maintenance fee when I turned 18. It went up from \$15,000 a month. I think it's \$25,000 now that I'm technically an adult."

"So you're actually saving your trust fund by being here."

"You could look at it that way." She didn't. "What does it cost to keep me here?"

"\$12,000 a month, give or take."

"What's the take?"

"If we send you to Stabilization, add another \$3000 to the total."

"Oh, kind of like an annuity."

Hazey glanced sharply at her, as if to judge whether she was joking.

"Seems like I'm your trust fund in a way," Lydia said.

"I can see how you might think that."

"Is that unusual?" Hazey asked after the clicking of Rahel's Geiger counter heels faded toward the end of the hall.

"What?"

"For your mother to walk out on you?"

"Oh that was mild. The last time I saw her, she called me a little pervert and an ingrate."

"Well, is it unusual for your mother to lose her cool?"

"That wasn't losing her cool. You should see her when she's really mad." Lydia saw a drinking glass fly and hit a man's shoulder. An ash tray, heavy brass or pewter, that he ducked.

"What does she do when she's really mad?"

"I didn't see her for three years from the time I was almost 15 till I was 17."

"Want to tell me about that?"

"Not particularly."

Hazey sighed. He went to the locked file cabinet behind him and rifled through the B's till he found her file. He paged through the bulging manila file and evidently found what he was looking for. "It says here that your grandfather charged your mother for lack of supervision for a minor and maintaining an unhealthy environment."

"Translation: the guy she was going to marry had sex with me until my nanny caught him in my bed."

"She was mad at you?"

"Why do you think she called me an oversexed little ingrate today?"

"Did you want to have sex with her fiance'?"

"He was a pig. If it meant she wouldn't marry him..."

Hazey said, "That's a lot of responsibility to put on a 14-year-old girl."

"What do you mean?"

"Saving your mother at 14."

"No, no. By then I was almost 15. She really couldn't see what a dick he was."

"Did you want to hurt her?"

"Hell, no! I was trying to help. She just didn't appreciate it so she stopped talking to me. That's when Grandpa Ben took over custodianship and I went to live in Grosse Point."

Hazey leaned forward with his hands tented in front of his face. "Lydia, you've been at Inner Horizons a little more than a year now. How would you characterize your progress?"

"I've been fucked up for 18 years. You don't think you can change me in only one, do you?"

"Actually, I don't think we can change you at all. You're the only one with the ability to do that."

Lydia moved over to the window and contemplated the circling coots in the small black pool. She looked away and caught sight of the gold wrapped box her mother had left behind. "Can I open my present now? Before she comes back and takes it away?"

"Be my guest," he said with a little hand gesture.

She tore into the shiny foil paper which was surprisingly thick and stiff and made swift work of the clump of silver pine coins and red berries attached to a coil of silver fabric ribbon. She threw the lid off an interior box and peeled back a nest of snowy white tissue that covered a picture of a man and woman embracing on the back of pristine white yacht. The two people were sitting next to each other on a bench and the woman was looking toward the photographer with a raised glasses of champagne while the man gazed at her in adoration.

Lydia leaned in to peer at the photograph. Her stomach lurched a little sideways. Lydia knew that photograph and she knew it had been altered. The original had been taken by Mom the day before she and Aldo were supposed to get married in the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Cathedral in Portofino. It was Lydia and Aldo who had been sitting on the formed fiberglass stern with the blue Mediterranean sea behind them. Her mother had somehow excised Lydia from the image as if she'd never been there in reality. Aldo was gripping Lydia's slender knee in one hairy hand while whispering in her ear and gazing at her with adoration. Lydia's 14-year-old hand raised a straw colored glass of champagne in the air while her mother's 40 year-old face stared back at the photographer with a knowing smile. Lydia heard a low sound of distress and didn't even realize it came out of her

Dr. Hazey's eyes were trained on her. "What's upsetting you in this picture?" he asked.

How to describe the happiness of that day without going into all the aftermath when Marlene, her E. German nanny, walked in on Aldo thrusting like a piston into her skinny and breastless body?

"I was there," she said, pointing. "That's not her, that's me." She put her index finger on the picture, on the place where Aldo was stroking her mother on the inside of one adolescent knee. She felt the red indentation of those Cuban-cigar scented fingers. The black hairs that lined the back of his hands which were sparser than the black hairs that coiled around her first dusky uncircumscribed dick.

The space between Hazey's eyes were knotted with puzzlement as he tried to parse what she was saying. "You mean you were there when the picture was taken?"

"Yes. I was. I mean... no. I was sitting where she is. Mom was taking the picture and Aldo was sitting next to me with his horny hand on my knee." She stabbed at the large, sausage shaped fingers with a few hairs on the knuckles and looked up at Hazey.

"Mom had the photo retouched to get rid of me."

She had always liked Aldo who was fun and funny, always joking around with the yacht boys and the masseuse and telling them dirty jokes in his Italian accented English that were too old for her. It bewildered he when she woke up to him lying on top of her, kissing her breasts and forcing her legs apart with his knee. She squealed when he started poking at her. It hurt like fire and it felt like he was both suffocating her with his weight and splitting her in two and it was the noise she made as she squirmed to defend herself, even as Aldo pressed one hairy hand over her mouth and hissed at her to take what he she was begging for, that woke up Marlene, the nanny, asleep in the room next door.

"That's my leg, can't you see? Look how skinny it is."

Hazey leaned closer and she heard his intake of breath when he saw where she was pointing.

"Why would your mother give this to you for your birthday."

Therapists! Sometimes you had to do all the work because they were just too damn stupid to see what was right in their face.

"She wanted to get rid of me," Lydia said. "Now you can't even tell I was ever there."

The raised glass of straw colored bubbles. Aldo's laughing eyes. The delirious regard for the woman who's skirt he was pushing his hand under. Oh, to have never existed on that day the way her mother wanted.

"Your mother is a sick woman," Hazey said. "I hope you see that."

"She may be sick but at least she's there."

"You're here now," he said. "So you won't ever have to be there again.

Lydia was closing up the white nest of tissue in order to cover up the picture in its expensive, gold-leafed frame.

"No," she said. "I doubt my Grandfather will ever let me live with her again."

"What about you, Lydia. Do you want to live with your mother?"

She turned her hopeless eyes toward the churning ducks that were having a hard time keeping up with the hole that was growing smaller by the freezing, flake-filled minute.. "Every minute of every day. Crazy, huh?"

"Understandable," Hazey said. "I'd be surprised if you didn't."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

"Dr. Hazey, is she crazy or am I?"

"Yes," he said.

"Damn. I was afraid of that."

"Don't be. It's the human condition. You might as well get used to it. I have to every day."

Her last question was one she's thought about off-and-on for years, whenever she thought she was making progress in therapy and felt momentarily optimistic, if not hopeful. "Could you fix her if you worked with her?"

"You mean, if your mother was my patient? If I worked with her in therapy?"

"I know it's never going to happen.... But\--?"

"I don't fix people, Lydia. No therapist does."

"Well what good are you?"

Dr. Hazey's grim face appeared to be thinking about the fucked up relationship between mother and daughter and unhappy with the same conclusion.

"I didn't say therapy wasn't helpful. All I was was that change is up to the individual."

"So you must work with a lot of patients who can't change. Doesn't that make you feel like a failure?"

"Out of the mouths of babes," he muttered under his breath.

"One day at a time, my dear. We can only take it one day at a time because that's all we're given."

The half-hour binged and the session ended with him saying he would bring Darlene up to speed this afternoon. "No doubt you'll be revisiting this conversation."

For some unknown reason, one of Aldo's hoary old jokes came back to her like a ghost. "Do you know the definition of eternity, Dr. Hazey?"

"Can't say I do."

"Two people, a ham, and talking about your relationship with your mother."

111815 Night of Punishment

The sky was clear. The starlight, sharp and crackling, felt crystalline with cold. When Lydia put her hand to the window, she could feel the deep cold on the other side like an electric pulse under her fingertips. It promised a long and frigid night.

A braided harvest-colored rug that had never felt human hands. Oak bed steads. Blandly mismatched side tables. A faux homey decor that felt sterile and uncomfortably institutional though it was meant to be warm. Lydia's grandmother had sent a beautiful French embroidered duvet cover and a feather-filled comforter to stuff into it that was heavenly to sleep under because the room was poorly insulated and the heat system struggled to keep the cold at bay.

After brushing her teeth, dutifully flossing, flushing and poking at her gums with the waterPik, massaging her pores with a dermatologist-recommended soap, toning with a slap of astringent, then dousing most of her head in a sink of cold water, she eyed the bare floor grimly.

She wore bikini underpants and a thin cotton camisole. She had silk ones that were warmer but they were off limits like her flannel night gown and wool sleep socks and anything with more than one layer of comfort.

In one part of the sky was a sharp light of a few rising planets and a pointillist spray of remote stars.

The light was blue and cold and she felt like an infinitesimal speck in the universe. The air had a crystalline quality. Sharp and crackling, as if it would hurt you lungs if you dared to breathe in.

Snow bright and moon lit like the half-way point between day and night.

She feels small and alone. Whatever spark of life she had in her heart seemed to shrink the presence of such blackness like a guttering flame.

LYDIA DISSES JAMES

Ways to show Lydia on the ragged edge

Lydia hated herself. It was so much easier to throw her loathing away from her person than to live with that ugliness in the mirror.

She kept a running tally of all the hateful things she had done that day. What hadn't she done?

She'd screamed at James when he wouldn't fuck her. When the rage at bing denied something as quick and easy a a wall fuck in the janitorial closet blinded her with hate, she hissed at him, "What the hell if wrong with you! Can't you get it up?" She'd looked dismissively at his crotch. "What the fuck? Are you gay?"

In her anger, she clambered up him and clung by her legs to his hips, her legs wrapped around his waist, her hands clutching him behind the neck. She had a vision of herself as a feral monkey she'd see at a summer camp in Guanacaste. The capuchin mother monkey swung herself through the trees with an orange-faced grim baby clinging to her for dear thing. The only thing that kept the baby from a 100 foot fall were the mother's spindly arms.

"What in the fuck is wrong with you," she had cried.

James was pushing at her with his arms. He held her lower body and hips away from his, even though she scissored her heels into his butt and kept a stranglehold on his neck. All those cartwheels and pommel horse dismounts in gymnastics gave her the strength of a small chimpanzee. "Can't you keep your dick up?"

James broke her neck hold and dangled her out in front of him like a doll. "Yes, I can get it up. I don't want to!"

"Why the fuck not?"

"Can't you think of somebody besides yourself?"

"No! I can't!" Her need was clear to her as an Idaho steam. Why couldn't he see that she couldn't think past this blazing need to be filled and comforted.

"You're fucking Reza," she cried.

"No!"

"Big Paul then. You're a fag."

"Am not!"

"You're a fat fucking limp dick. You can't get it up unless you're going to cornhole."

He let go of her then. It was only six inches or so but she stumbled backwards and whacked the small of her back with the shower knob.

"Jesus, where do you come up with that filth?" he said.

"Limp dick. Faggot!"

He was already climbing out of the tub, the shower rings jingling like bear bells above her head. He yanked the door open and then hesitated and turned back with the expression of a man turning away from a clogged toilet. "You're pathetic," he said. "Get a life."

She shot back, "Get a dick!" but the door was already closing in her face and her words were swallowed up in its slam.

She was still standing in the cold porcelain tub. Her back smarted from knocking against the sharp shower handle. The emptiness inside her felt like a yawning black hole. "Dick," she whispered. "Fucking sick fucking limp fucking dick."

She held a condom in her hand. She yanked at his zipper while she clambered up his torso and scissored her legs tight around his hips. He wass pushing and pulling at her scrabbling hands. She'd managed to get the condom unwrapped and she was holding his softening dick and trying to push it on without success. When she dropped it to the floor of the tub, it fell like a balloon without any air.

"Don't," he said. He squeezed her wrist to get her to let go and she had an unreasoning desire to slap the shit out of his wayward penis as if she could make it stand up and pay attention. "What in God's name is wrong with you?"

"Get it up! I need it," she hissed.

"It doesn't work that way."

"Well how does it work? When Reza gives you a blow job, you stand up for it don't you?"

"You are disgusting."

"I'd rather be disgusting than a... a limp dick!"

"So we agree on one thing." His voice was tense and bitter.

"What?"

"You're so disgusting, you've even made me disgusted with myself. Get off!" He shoved her backwards as he stepped over the tub wall and she stumbled backwards into the sharp edge of the shower handle. "You're a black hole."

(TRAGIC TUESDAY CONCEPT)

CYNTHIA READS WHILE CLEANING HER FACE AT THE SINK IN FRONT OF A MIRROR

\<\$W\>

OLD GIRL WANTED A RAZOR in the worst way. If she had a razor, it would only take a second.

Her new roommate, Rachel, was on her quilt-covered bed, shuffling through a make-up bag. ["]{dir="rtl"}Damn. I forgot my toenail clippers. Can I borrow yours?" she asked.

Old Girl snorted. ["]{dir="rtl"}They took those away from me when I got here."

["]{dir="rtl"}How do you clip your nails?"

["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t. They just grow under my feet. They[']{dir="rtl"}re so long now, I don[']{dir="rtl"}t need shoes."

Rachel actually laughed at the hoary joke. ["]{dir="rtl"}If I[']{dir="rtl"}d known they[']{dir="rtl"}d give me a comedian for a roommate, I wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t have made such a stink about coming here."

Old Girl felt the uneasy tug of friendship but she dismissed it as something she couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t afford. Too bad she wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t going to be around long enough to tell all her suicide jokes. Not that many people appreciated them.

["]{dir="rtl"}Yippee! I didn[']{dir="rtl"}t forget!" Rachel triumphantly held up a wicked pair of clippers from the depths of her bag.

Old Girl was astonished. ["]{dir="rtl"}Didn[']{dir="rtl"}t they go through your stuff when you got here? That[']{dir="rtl"}s contraband."

["]{dir="rtl"}Toenail cutters?"

["]{dir="rtl"}You don[']{dir="rtl"}t cut your nails and make them bleed? Like every other girl here?"

Rachel shrugged. ["]{dir="rtl"}Guess I[']{dir="rtl"}m just not that creative."

On the way to the shower, Old Girl had a flash of inspiration. Cutting nails to the quick wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t the only thing clippers were good for. ["]{dir="rtl"}Mind if I borrow your clippers?"

Rachel hesitated.

["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t have HIV," OG said.

["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s not that. It[']{dir="rtl"}s ..." Rachel leaned a hip against the sink, clenching a hand like she was trying to grab at something. ["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t know you well enough to watch you hurt yourself."

["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t know you well enough to off myself in front of you."

Rachel handed over the clippers without another word.

She went about her face washing routine, which looked like it required a rocket science degree to get through all the steps, unlike the splash-and-dash method that Old Girl used.

When Rachel finally toweled off her face, Old Girl made a show of holding up the clippers so Rachel could see her drop them back in her make-up bag. ["]{dir="rtl"}See. No harm, no foul."

SHORT VERSION (30 SEC)

OG won't see Rachel's face as she completes her seven-step facial cleansing at the sink. After Rachel applies the layer of pore opener --- or is it the astringent that closes the pores and the \$70 cream is supposed to open them --- she l gently pats her face dry, hearing her mother's say, "Don't rub at your skin with a towel. That's how you get old and wrinkly." In the mirror, Rachel's brown skin looks fresh and unlined, even though the loss of her baby has turned her heart to leather.

It isn[']{dir="rtl"}t until Rachel walks by the Baby Changing Station letters that she registers Old Girl[']{dir="rtl"}s handiwork. OG used her nail clippers to scrape off the ["]{dir="rtl"}c" in the type so it now reads, ["]{dir="rtl"}Baby Hanging Station."

It could be worse, she thinks; she could've gotten psycho Dani for a roommate instead of OG, who according to the Healing House grape vine, is only clinically depressed.

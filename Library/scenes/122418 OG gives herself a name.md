122418 OG gives herself a name

Her given name was Vivian Gormly but after her parents died, she always introduced herself as Vivian Lifeless. Somehow this idea, when mingled with her very real desire to die, made her start thinking of herself as old and decrepit, i.e. ready to die, so when she arrived at the Program, she insisted, with a 16-year-old's flair for drama and histrionics, that everyone call her Old Girl. Then, a few weeks in, it took too much boring explanation to tell every new kid who came into treatment the history of Old Girl as a name, so in time, in the lazy way of all nicknames, Old Girl devolved into OG, and now no one -- herself included -- remembered that she used to have a real name, not an acronym.

"What's it stand for?" Rachel asked.

"OG," she said.

"No, really."

Here we go again. "Old Goat," she said reluctantly.

"Old Gonad is better," said Reza.

"Old Groupie?" Rachel said.

"What about Old Gormless? Reza who'd come into the program about the same time she had, suggested.

"But what the hell is a Gorm?" Rachel asked.

"Gorm is my last name." OG lied to shut off the pointless and boring discussion. It could be reasoned, Godless, gormless but not goddamn harmless.

Angela and Gabriel, two gifts from God, her mother, a devout Catholic, liked to say. If they were all gifts from God, why had he taken three of them away and left one behind to suffer? That was the question OG had asked the priest at their funeral. His answer was some horse shit about God and his mysterious ways and that's when OG realized that God was just another way to say "I don't know."

One problem with thinking about dying for so long, she was becoming bored with it. That's how she had started, to her dismay, noticing more of the living world. When she first arrived in Idaho, all she could think of was getting away into the nothingness of the wilderness. Now, she was still fixated on getting away but to somethingness which was weird and uncomfortable because something wasn't defined like nothing was.

"Old Gorming," she said in a sudden rush. "If you're gormless, you're clueless."

"How come you never hear 'gormful' then? And what does old have to do with it?" said Rachel.

"I gorm not," OG said. "But I'll gorm on it and get back to you.

"Okaaayyyy." Rachel's tone suggested she wasn't buying OG's explanation of how she got her name. But who cared? In less than eight hours -- she peaked at her watch -- OG would be out of her hair and she could have all the hangers to herself. Fair trade, she told herself. She'd traded Viviane Gorming for a new identity that even she couldn't explain why she liked it.

"Is gorm like grock?" Rachel said a minute later. "A kind of knowing?"

"I guess. I'm not the OED, you know. Just OG."

"Ha ha, smarty pants. You love word play. Plus you're the one who's always reading." She gestured to the books spilling out of OG'S backpack. It was true. She didn't really miss having a cell phone but the loss of a library card had been a torment until she passed out of Intensive to the short-leash of Transition.

"What's OED," Reza wanted to know. Speaking of clueless.

"I don't know my name is OG. Look it up."

"I was just asking."

"Well ask someone else and leave us alone."

"Fine," Reza sniffed. "I'll ask James."

"It's a dictionary, numnutz. Where the words are," said Rachel.

"Why would you want that when there's Google? Reza wanted to know.

"Where do you think Google came from?" OG asked.

"YouTube," he said. "I read about it on the Internet."

020919 Reza blow up through his POV

James had something on his mind. There was a hangdog expression to his normally superior good looks. What would it be like to be tall and handsome with girls practically falling in his lap? Reza was lucky if a girl even looked at him when James was in the room. Actually, James had nothing to do with it because they didn't look at him when James wasn't around either.

Reza was short, brown, skinny and bowlegged. Why would a girl want a dwarf when they could have a tall blond basketball player who got a Corvette for his sixteenth birthday? Reza wanted a lousy motor bike that didn't cost a quarter as much as a Corvette. His parents acted like he wanted the moon. They told him no because they were protecting his brain but what good was a brain when his dick did all his thinking, anyway?

"... sorry for the other night," James was saying.

"For what?"

"... the night you got stabbed? Remember?"

Reza's hand pulsed with pain. A strong bass note of anguish to his usual patter of irritating tics and jerks and tappings that he used to control the uncontrollable that crackled away inside him. How could he forget? He'd just been teasing Estie. Everybody else got away with teasing him and he tried it just once and got stabbed, practically to death, by a head case who was usually nice to him. Why Estie chose him to stab, he had no idea. He liked her! Tried to treat her nice.

"When I called you, 'Monkey Boy,'" James said. "Do you remember?"

Hell yes, he remembered. James was clueless if he thought Reza could forget his constant casual cruelty. Reza knew he was annoying; he actually tried hard not to be, but he generally couldn't help it because he was no more in control of his own body than the people around him. That didn't mean he didn't have feelings. "Monkey Boy" had hit like a slightly heavier slap in a series of blows. Oh, he membered all right, but the memory was atop of a pile of other blows. So did that make it so much worse or was he just inured to the pain?

He took a deep breath, a technique his therapist was always telling him to use to "self-calm." "I remember," he said, feeling a flush of high anxiety. at all.

Writing from another character's POV, in this case Reza's, gives me a new and interesting perspective that adds knowledge and insight I wouldn't have if all I knew of Reza was through James's limited view. What I am trying to do is find the source of the rising pressure that causes Reza to blow up in the face of James' witless apology.

James expects it to be easy, Reza sees. Apologize and all is forgiven. He is so used to getting everything he wants and needs with his superior gifts of good skin and good hair and height and mad athletic skills. Why wouldn't he expect Reza---small, brown, weak, ADHD, lesser in all ways except wicked smart but unable to control all the disparate neurons from firing at all moments in every day -- why wouldn't the lesser accept the apology from the greater? Fuck you, James. Take your apology and shove it where the sun don't shine. A phrase Reza had heard in the drug store when some Idaho kid in front of him didn't have enough money for condoms and blamed the pharmacist.

What's interesting here is that writing from another POV gives the writer access to a whole different world that one's POV characters only partially share. Each person in a scene is naturally blinked by their own experience, or lack of it, plus hampered by their painful pasts and their fears of the future. Sometimes characters blurt out things when they -- and you, their scribe---least expect it. That's the gift of writing from another's POV, even though this character will not speak directly to the reader. They will speak to the character they're fighting with or trying to convince in an argument, and you will understand the importance of what they're trying to convey when language is often a pool substitute for emotion.

As James stumbled on, Reza began to feel trapped by his big body. James had made an unusual effort to be nice, for once. He'd unwrapped the hair shirt of the bothersome bandage. He got it smoothed out and unwrinkled, which Reza couldn't do onehanded, especially since Estie had stabbed his left hand, the dominant one he used for everything, including writing music. Now he was stuck with his fucked up right hand that could never do anything right, hence the unraveling gauze that Reza had to ask James to set right.

James, in his superior cluelessness, had sat down on Reza's bed and boxed him in. He was still boxing him in just sitting there when the bandage was done and that was annoying. James had everything in the world that Reza didn't have. Good looks, clond hair, blue-eyes, athletic skill Reza would never have, although he was smarter in nath and physics and chemistry which was like saying that he was smart in all the ways that didn't count.

Reza shrank back against the wall, trying to make himself small in the corner. It was weird how he felt invaded in the place in Healing House that was truly his: a single bed that was likely to stay single for the rest of his sexless life.

Monkey Boy had hurt like a stone lobbed after a whole shovelful of gravel. "Midget. Gnat. Dingbat. Dork. Dweeb. El Stupido. Shorty. Rat. You called me that too."

James face took on a deeper shade of what. Color? Hauteur? Shame? Something Reza didn't recognize because he hadn't seen it before.

"And Apu," he continued. "Don't forget that. 'Apu' is your favorite."

James cleared his throat. Tried again.

"I wanted to tell you I was sorry...," he started out but Reza didn't let him finish.

"You *wanted* to say you *were* sorry." Reza emphasized the past tense, willfully misunderstanding the present tense James had meant. "Does that mean you were sorry then but you're not sorry now?"

"No, stupid." James stopped. Cleared his throat again, seemingly flummoxed. "I meant I am sorry." He raised his voice which caused Reza to flinch back further into the corner. He wasn't afraid of James, not really, but he was feeling even smaller than usually, trapped by that big big body weighing down his mattress.

"Why do you do that?" Reza asked. "You're always calling me names. What's wrong with plain old Reza?"

James blinked. "I... uhm...." He stopped. "I just didn't... uhm... think..."

Reza pounced. "That's your problem. You never think about how what you say makes me feel. I call you James every damn day and what do you call me? Stink bug. I shower every day just like you do!"

"I know that." James passed a hand over his lower jaw where the blond hairs were just beginning to stubble. Reza's dark beard was way ahead of James. The one place he had James beat and he had to shave twice a day to get rid of it.

"You think everything you say is funny, don't you. Stink Bug always gets a big laugh, so you say it again. People laughed when you called me "Monkey Boy," didn't they?"

Another pass over the blond stubble. "I don't know," James muttered. "Estie stabbed you right after that and you were screaming so loud, I didn't hear it."

"You never hear it, unless it suits you," Reza said, sense he was on the high road for once and James was unaccountable on the low road, not a place he was accustomed to occupying.

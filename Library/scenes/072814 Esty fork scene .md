072814 Esty fork scene

Princess Lydia had a double all to herself once Esty got sent off to Stable so everybody knew she'd tattled on her for wetting the bed. But a week or so ago, Old Girl had overheard Margaret telling Darlene that Reza had wet the bed and she had to change his sheets. So Old Girl just assumed Reza would keep his mouth shut, knowing how shitty and shameful bedwetting felt. Instead, he did the opposite. When you hated yourself for being weak, the second you got a chance to hurt someone even weaker, you lashed out. Because being the hurter felt so much better than being hurt.

Reza and Lydia egged each other on. If one landed a successful jab at Esty, the other jabbed harder and more viciously.

"Jesus, you've got a lard ass. Don't you ever look at yourself in the mirror?"

Why Lydia kept picking at Esty was a mystery. She'd had her room to herself for two weeks; she should have been thankful Esty had gotten sent off to Stable for one of her blow ups. Unless Lydia was trying to engineer another one?

Reza said, "Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?"

"A smart ass," Reza crowed, while Old Girl said "dumb ass" under her breath. Couldn't they all give it a rest?

It was like punching a bowl of Jello. Esty just absorbed the blows and quivered a little. She didn't fight back. She wasn't quick enough to make snappy come backs. But Old Girl noticed a few ominous details. She was no longer sleepy-eyed and zoned out. An hour before when they'd been tormenting her, she barely registered anything they said, she was miles within herself. Now the pokes were landing in the Jello and if they didn't hurt Esty, they were at least annoying her.

Old Girl tucked a few ominous details in her consciousness. A small muscle in Esty's jaw---a sign of teeth clenching? Or the ticking of a bomb? Esty's red-rimmed eyes were no longer hazy and unfocused. Her pupils were bright like a weasel's, and she'd lost her vague, harmless affect.

At first, Old Girl couldn't figure out what their game was. They sat on opposite sides of Esty and exchanged grins behind her back. Reza served himself and passed the potatoes and gray peas down the table, away from Esty. Lydia, who sat on the other side of Esty, passed the meatloaf the opposite direction. Darlene, at the head of the table, was rabbiting on about the blizzard forecast that night and was oblivious to the fact that they had islanded Esty from the food.

At first, Old Girl couldn't figure out what their little game was. They picked seats on the opposite sides of Esty. When the meatloaf came to Lydia, she took a slice, then slid it across the table Paul, who must have been in on it. He sent the dish down the opposite side of the table. Reza took the boiled potatoes and sent them away from Esty, on his side of the table, then repeated the action with the butter, then the peas. The only food that landed near Esty was the naked spinach salad garnished with two paltry egg slices and a lone mushroom.

"Hey," Esty looked across the table at the dwindling supply of meatloaf. "You skipped me."

Lydia made wide, shocked eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Yes you did," Reza said patiently. "Right before I passed you the potatoes."

The only thing on Esty's plate was the lone dinner roll the Program allowed people on the "high energy protein" diet. Meanwhile, skinny Paul, who was allowed extra-calories , shoveled half a cube of butter on a mound of potatoes the size of a small mountain.

"What?" Paul said. "The potatoes went around twice."

Darlene, sensing something amiss, interrupted her rant about black ice and called down from the head of the table, "Esty, how come you're not eating anything?"

Reza flopped a plateful of naked, undressed wilted spinach on top of Esty's dinner roll. "Have some greens, Stanker. They make your shit smell sweet."

For a second, Old Girl thought Esty might cry. She was frowning at the spinach like it was garbage and when she picked up her fork, Old Girl expected her to use it to flick the crap to the floor. Instead, she gripped the handle in her fist and drove the tines in the flesh between Reza's thumb and forefinger.

Reza screamed. He tried to jump away from the table, but was stopped halfway up by Esty who threw the considerable bulk of her torso over his forearm and drove the fork deeper into the tabletop.

"Stop!"

"Esty, let go!!"

"Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated the excited babble and Lydia's hyena laugh raised the pitch to ear-splitting.

Esty, still pressing Reza to the table, reached across the table and dragged a slice of meatloaf from Paul's plate with her free hand. She ate it thoughtfully while Darlene fought to pull the fork out of Reza's hand.

Old Girl was sitting at the end of the table and could see everything like a movie scene unfolding in real time. Guess this means dessert is off the table, she thought. She was chewing on a bland boiled potato. It was too much trouble to retrieve the butter dish now upended between Reza's flopping legs on the shag carpet. Even if she'd managed to avoid getting kicked in the head, the butter would be fuzzed with orange. If Margaret was on duty, she'd make sure they got popcorn later, but Darlene---fucking clueless Darlene---would have no idea how to make this right t.

Esty makes me sick. If they weren't already picking on her, Old Girl would have slapped her.

The thought surprised her. Usually Old Girl stayed out of the petty dramas and ongoing meanness. She was strong enough to fend off any bullshit aimed at her person. But today, all the torture Reza and Lydia and Paul visited on Esty seemed deserved. Stupid Esty wouldn't fight back. She sat like a lump of blubber on the couch and took their jabs and kicks like a beaten dog. Did they torture her just to see if they could get a rise out of her? Was it some kind of need to get a reaction to prove they were the strong ones and Esty was the weak? Or was it just more fun to be the one doing the hurting than being hurt?

At one point, Esty lumbered off to the bathroom and while she was gone, Reza and Paul got to arm-wrestling on the floor and one of them kicked over a glass of water on the end table next to the plaid couch. They ignored the water spill, just let it soak into the cushions, not that Old Girl thought the old couch couldn't handle it.

When Esty came back, she sat on the wet spot and made everybody whoop with laughter. Her face was clueless. Not a clue why everyone was laughing at her.

Jesus. Was Esty so slow she didn't feel her butt getting wet? Apparently.

Reza, with a feral gleam in his black eyes, said, "You just went to the batroom, Stanker. How come you peed in your pants?"

Esty wrinkled her bovine forehead. "I didn't pee my pants."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

That made people howl. You could almost hear the gears in Esty's rusty brain clanking toward the feeling of dampness on her pants. She stood up and turned her broad, cottage-cheesed ass to the room and tried to peer at it over her shoulder as her hand patted the dark spreading spot on her beige pants.

By then, the whole group, even Old Girl was laughing and jeering. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Stink!" "You pissed yourself!" "Stanker is a stinker!" Nobody said you came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit.

Esty's befuddlement was heartbreaking. She knew she hadn't pissed herself but she couldn't figure out why her ass was wet. She threw Old Girl, a sometime ally, a pleading look like "Why is this happening?" Old Girl ignored her. She wanted to slap her for being so stupid. Such a victim.

"No wonder Esty stinks," Old Girl called out to the group. "She's piss poor at holding her water!"

No wonder Esty stinks. She can't hold her water.

No wonder nobody wants to sit next to Esty. She'll piss on you.

Rusty\'s Plan\
In the Crawl Space

It wasn\'t exactly a plan. More like a series of daydreams. Rusty had waited under the nuthouse in the crawl space alternately napping on the old bedspread he\'s dragged with him and listening to the sounds of life going on about him in his hole. He\'d moved his nap away from the family room where they kept the pool table because the breaking balls reminded him of the sound of his old man breaking sticks for a whipping. Under the bedrooms, nearer to the door in the laundry room that led to the crawl space was quieter except that some asshole had loaded a bunch of boxes marked Xmas that he made a mental note to come back for. People at the dump were always looking for ornaments and crap.

In the quiet, keep in his own fog, the damp smell of earth all around him, he felt corned in his own cave. The blond girl with the tight, muscular ass. Hair hanging down like a curtain. When she straightened up, the letters on the back of her tee shirt were like a promised. Poker in the rear. Oh Christ in heaven she wanted it! Just the idea of seeing her in her bare legs in the tee shirt riding up to reveal bikini panties that he\'d pull down to her ankles\...

That was the reason he\'d loaded up a bucket of old paint smelling faintly of turpentine. A squirt can of fire starter if they didn\'t light with the 1st match or two. He patted his vest pocket making sure he hadn\'t just dreamed of packing the matches.

He\'s been dreaming so insistently day and night in was hard to tell what happened from what was about to happen.

He\'d planned the firestarter and the \_\_\_ bucket of turpentine soaked rags. He\'d planned being outside the back door after the fire call went out. He imagined her racing out in the night in her bare feet in the shirt---an idea struck him. Maybe he could be manning and hose and accidentally like spray her in the chest\-- that was good. He rerolled the tape in his mind and imagined the fire call that brought him from the back road behind the house to the yard where he\'d be standing in his new firestorm jacket. She\'d be able to see him by the light of the flames but she\'d be almost blinded by the neon reflective tape and she\'d be standing there in the wet tee shirt with her tits all perky and Rusty would duct tape her mouth to keep her quiet and\...

Rusty hadn\'t figure out that part yet. How he going to grab her with all the other assholes on the fire fighter team getting in the way.

He\'d have to grab her when she barreled out the back door and before she ran out in the yard where he\'d first seen her bent over and offering him herself ass first like a bitch in heat. Reluctantly, he gave up on the hose idea. Once he had her locked in the trailer he could rub her down with maple syrup and eat her with a spoon, if he wanted.

The fire was just to get her out in the cold in the shirt. A means to an end, as the old man used to say. What an end, he thought patting the matches then starting the tape of his mind once again.

Ramifications of fire the morning after.

Margaret got the call about the emergency staff meeting at 8 AM her day off, damn it, but she dutifully got to the office 5 minutes early leaving Papa Lloyd and a passel of videos to entertain Charlie\'s twin 4-year olds. Lloyd would be fine sitting in the Barcalounger in a Demerol haze while the twins watched Beauty and the Beast for the 99^th^ time.

A few of the therapists- Rose and Bruce and H\_ the new hire, were already there hoovering down donuts and coffee. Gretchen had surprised Margaret by being Jonny- on the spot with the donuts, until she took a bit of one and nearly spit it out. It had a weird oily taste and then she spotted the box they came in from Megan\'s Vegan and the off-taste made sense, without eggs or dairy or God forbid lard.

Hazey dragged in about 10 minutes late looking like he\'d been in a cat fight. His hair stood up in the back and he smelled smokey, like he\'d come directly from the Healing House fire the night before. Maybe he had although Margaret had never known the good doctor to have any trouble sleeping. Why would he when he had a festival of Ambien and Sonata and Lunesta prescribed to every kid in the program.

\"Arson!\" Hazey said dramatically and he looked around the room as if he was going to find the match. The fire chief found the source of fire in t the laundry room. Somebody lit a bucket of flammable material.\"

There was a lof of oohing and ahing.

\"Thank God- and our well trrained staf- here Hazey was looking at Gretchen, who\'d been on site, though sleeping, and Charleen, the Duty, who\'d actually made sure everybody got out and had the forethought to grab the coats and outdoor gear in the entry so nobody froze to death while the firefighters put out the blaze.

Margaret had gotten the scoop form Charleen who\'d called her on the telephone tree to tell her about the staff meeting.

Gretchen was simpering, saying,\" It was nothing,\" to the therapists near her who were saying \"Good Job!\" \"It\'s a miracle nobody was hurt.\" to her. Margaret didn\'t roll her eyes but she wanted to so she thought about Mackelmore. \"I want to be free, I want to just live in my cadillac, this is my shit.\"

The gist of it was that they\'d put out the fire before anything major happened. The laundry room, where the fire started, was toast. They\'d have to reroof the girl\'s wing, but thank God. the shakes were in pretty good shape and didn\'t catch fire. Something about the venting system for the dryer made the flames shoot into the sky, making the fire look worse than it was. Smoke damage. Some loss of personal property in the bedroom adjoining the laundry room.

\"Whose was that? Bruce wanted to know.

Margaret said automatically, \"Rachel and Old Girl\'s.\"

Charleen said \"Old Girl\'s the one your want to thank. She smelled the smoke. She\'s really the one who woke everybody. I came out and she was screaming to high heaven and pounding on doors.\"

Charleen didn\'t exactly contradict Hazey\'s praise of Gretchen but she sure left her out of the story.

\"

\"Old Girl\'s is coming along,\" Bruce, her therapist said. \"I think she\'s turning a corner.\"

Gretchen was eyeing poor old Charleen who was on her fourth donut like she\'d like to take her around the corner. Charleen chewed the awful donut and Margaret wondering, for about the 1000^th^ time, if she\'d been born without an off button.

Hazey instructed the therapists to be alert for \"fire trauma.\" Margaret understood that to mean an increase in night terrors and bad dreams. Therapeutic use of Valium for the borderlines and OCDers and other anxiety disorders. He left the housekeeping details to Gretchen who spent a good 5 minutes praising her good fortune at \"being there for the kids\" and she talked about her own therapeutic applications of hot chocolate once the firefighters let them back in. How anyone could take credit for boiling water and passing out cocoa packets was beyond her but Margaret was glad she\'d at least thought of warming the kids up after 2 hours of standing out in the cold.

Margaret had a heavy day of house cleaning ahead. She called Granpa Lloyd and arranged for the 16 year old neighbor girl to take the twins to the park and fix everybody lunch so theoretically Lloyd could nap while they were gone and be ready for another round of Mulan and Barney videos until she got home.

The girls were going to have another slumber party in the sleeping bags that night, assuming Margaret and a cleaning crew of volunteers who needed the money could get the place aired out, throw away the melted carpet in the hall and sort though the wreckage of Rachel and O.G\'s room for anything salvageable.

Maybe this meant that a new washer & dryer- industrial strength this time!- was in her future. She\'d go online later in the day and figure out which model and make to order before Gretchen even thought of it. She almost wanted to thank the son-of-a-bitch who\'d set the fire for that. Always a silver lining.

Hazey had had no intelligence about who in the world would want to torch the laundry room. Most likely it was on of the sick kids, they figured out the damnest things to do to show they were in pain.

\"The arson is under investigation,\" Hazey said.

It had to be somebody inside, Margaret\'s opinion. Why would anybody on the outside object to her kids having clean sheets?

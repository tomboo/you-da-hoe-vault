MARGARET DIDN\'T JUST DEMONSTRATE TO LYDIA how to change the leaking gasket in the girl's bathroom. She made her pull the faucet, clean out the goo and gunk in the trap, replace the washers, the O-rings, the old screw and the nut. James went through the same routine at another sink.

It felt good to do something with her hands.

You\'re a wiry little thing. Stronger than you look, Margaret said. "Plus you're a quick study.\"

Lydia was surprised by the compliment. When water gushed out of the copper pipe and the faucet shut off clean, she felt a small surge of pride.

\"When we graduate from the program, maybe we can become plumbers,\" James said.

"Don't laugh. It pays a hell of a lot better than Day Supervisor,\" Margaret said.

Does it pay better than sucking dick? Lydia wanted to ask.

Margaret returned the massive pipe wrench to her bag. Thanks to Margaret, Lydia had a a whole new perspective on the word "carpetbagger." In their Civil War unit in history class, the professor talked a lot about the reconstruction of the South. When Lydia heard the term 'carpetbagger', she thought of rug salesmen like the Iranian ones she was familiar with on 8 Mile Road in Detroit. What carpetbaggers had to do with reconstruction, she had no idea. Pay attention, Lydia told herself for the hundredth time. You could miss something you need to know.

Margaret reminded James to meet Josh at his downtown office at 3:30. She told Lydia to be on time for her 3:00 with Darlene. \"Tell her what you learned today."

\"About changing gaskets or giving blow jobs?\"

"The one you learned the most from."

Lydia had an instant of pride, one of her first. "Thanks." She said. "Thanks a lot."

Margaret looked at her blankly, as if she was speaking a foreign language.

Lydia said, "For today... for that thing with Jed."

"Jed? His name is Ned. Ned Simplot. His mother, Nora, was in 4-H with me. She's nice. Horse-mad, but nice. Ned was about ten when a horse stepped on him. He hasn't been the same since. You know he's almost forty, don't you?"

Lydia didn't. Didn't care much either. As long as someone's wallet was big enough, she thought age was irrelevant. Well, maybe if she'd known Jed was forty, she would have said, no, thank you, and walked past him when he said came on to her at Dunkin' Donuts. But she'd needed the five bucks she cadged out of him to pay for her baker's dozen.

You owe me, he had said. Story of her life.

How'd you meet him anyway, Margaret wanted to know.

"The usual way. Around," Lydia said. She meant around Ned's dick, though she wasn't about to spell that out to Margaret.

"I mean it, Lydia. Stay away from him. He's trouble."

Lydia's hands went up involuntarily like birds in flight. Story of my life, she was thinking. "OK," she said aloud.

And meant it.

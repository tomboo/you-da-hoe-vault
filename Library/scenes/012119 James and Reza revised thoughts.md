012119 James and Reza revised thoughts

Reza wasn't working on his accountability letter either. He said his dad didn't want to hear any excuses. "What else is there?"

Possible moves:

\--extend the scene with Josh when James hangs up on parents to talk about Rachel and Reza and his casual racism

\--look at the fork scene where Reza gets stabbed and make it an even bigger clusterfuck where James misbehaves by calling Reza "monkey boy"

\--write out on cards all the many actions of James and Rachel and think about how they interrelate with each other to aid in plot order

James was slowly waking up to a different side of Reza. He was usually so fucking annoying it was impossible to see him as anything better than a midget or a gnat. All he wanted to do was to slap him away and he was surprised in mid-slap by the idea that they were not that different. James was a fuck up. Reza was a fuck up. Reza was a different fucked up that James, in his fuckery, was too fucked up to see.

James remembered that moment at dinner when Estie forked Reza in the back of the hand. He had called him "monkey boy" right before the blow up. He'd forgotten all about it in the aftermath of Estie's removal when she was kicking and screaming at the top of her lungs while Reza was screaming in the same register in pain, while they carted him off to Emergency to remove the fork.

"Exciting," said Josh, when James recounted what happened.

"Very," said James.

"Bet you'll pass the peas faster next time, won't you."

"You think I'm going to sit next to her after that? You're insane."

"No, James. I'm not the one in treatment. I'm treating you."

"Would you hurry it up? I'd like to be cured and get out of here. My basketball is suffering."

"So would Reza. Do you see that?"

A long silence. Fucking Josh. Always pointing out the unpleasant smell in the room.

"Are you saying that Reza and I are alike?"

"What do you think?"

"I wish you wouldn't answer every question with another question. It's annoying as shit."

"How do you think Reza feels when you call him Monkey Man? Or Apu?"

Shit. How did Josh know about that. The cold expression on Rachel's face when the words "monkey boy" came out of James's mouth. It would have frozen Lake Couer d'Alene if Estie hadn't broken everything loose when she stabbed Reza.

"How'd you hear about that?"\
"It's called 'staff meeting', James."

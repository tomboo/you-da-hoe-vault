James and the Crow

James slept like the dead. He came to as if submerged deep in dark water and he floated for a long time, rising slowly through blackness , then green black, then blue dime waters to a gray snowy light. Fuck, he groaned. he wanted to run in the worst way. He\'d seen people running occasionally on the roads, completely smothered in wool hats and tights and gloves but he couldn\'t figure out how they managed to stay upright when there was a layer of black ice over the deceptive blanket of snow.

He\'d finally hailed a runner who was loping past the shuttle at school. He ignored Margaret\'s screech \-- \"James! You nimrod! Get back here! \-- and called, \"What are you putting your shoes?\"

The old grizzled dude flashed James a grin. \"Idaho cleat,\" he said. He pulled his foot up like he was stretching a \_\_\_\_ and twisted backward to point to the screw heads that poked through the waffle weave sold. \"\'2\' screws work best. I tried carpet tacks but they were out too fast.\"

James lay on his back thinking about how in hell he was going to get his hands on a hammer and anything sharper than a toothpick. Fucking suiciders had made anything sharp, metal or dangerous off limits. God forbid if the program slips up and one of them managed to nail their hand to a coffee table.

A foul smell intruded on his thoughts. He looked across the room in the gray light for Reza, his roommate\'s shoes. He\'d told the miserable little fucker to leave the sweat-fouled Vans in the hall. He couldn\'t see them but that didn\'t mean the little shit hadn\'t stashed them under the bed. James would deal with that. He\'d bury them in the trash bins next to the garage. Reza would piss and moan but out of sight, out of mind.

It was weird. The smell kept getting stronger. Worse than usual, like it was coming from somewhere close to his head.

James sat up and switched on the light. The door opened and Reza came into the room in his boxers. He had the red Vans on his feet, laces flapping, the heels mashed down like he continually walked on them like a pair of house slippers.

\"What\'s that on your pillow?\" Reza said.

\"What?\" James twisted around to look where Reza was pointing. Something brown and wet had leaked onto the sheet. James plucked the pillow he\'d just been sleeping on to his chest.

\"Holy fuck!\" Flattened by the weight of James's head, a black crow lay with outstretched wings. Where its belly should have been a purple mass of guts, gray blobs wriggled slowly eating the carrion flesh. It was like the revelation of what the thing was let loose more of its foul smell.

James and Reza hit the door at the same instant. Reza\_\_\_ and quicker shouldered through and James was right behind him.

\"Margaret! Margaret! Where are you?\"

Their voices echoed through the hall like very young children crying for their mother.

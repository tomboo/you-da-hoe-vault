YOUDAHO

BY CYNTHIA HARTWIG

ONE

OLD GIRL WANTED TO KILL HERSELF in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy when all you had to draw upon were the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Nine young adults --- "YAs" as the staff at Inner Horizons called residents 17- to 20-years old --- draggled into the Healing House living room for Process Group. They were trying not to look like they were hurrying to get seated by 9 AM. Three couches were shoved together in the usual off-kilter circle.

Darlene rapped on the meditation gong. Inner Horizons Therapeutic, Holistic and Wellness Center for Troubled Teens in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, had recently promoted her to Head Therapist. She was usually too high up in the food chain to lead Process Group but today, because Axel Friedman had been fired, she was subbing.

The gong set off a flurry of pushing and shoving to get a seat on the couch with the black and brown blots called the Rorschach Couch. Nobody wanted to get stuck on the Jizz Couch, not since Lydia Bronfmann had been caught banging Axel, her therapist, on it.

Dani Cohen tossed a hip-check at Lydia. She flopped into place before Lydia could get there first. Lydia mouthed "Eat me" at Dani, then she stretched out full length on the plaid Jizz Couch, taking the whole thing for herself. Why should Lydia care about sitting on the wet spot when the bodily fluids were some of her own?

Welcome to the twice-weekly bitch fest known as Process Group.

Old Girl scooted her ottoman away from the group. She faced the picture window looking out on a curtain of gray snow. It had started snowing last October and was going to keep on snowing until May.

Darlene sighed. "Demerit card to Dani, one to Lydia. See me after Process for paperwork." Then, without a pause, she launched into a lengthy introduction of the new black girl like a cheer leader. "Meet the newest member of the Inner Horizons team! Rachel Cathcart! Yay!"

Last week, a tall willowy black girl had been frog-marched into Healing House by two ex-cops in matching ski jackets and baseball caps that said T*rust in God, Buy a Gun*. If your parents brought you to treatment \-- or in Old Girl\'s case, your guardians, Uncle David and Aunt Peggy --- it meant you were poor. If you arrived by escort, your parents paid a bundle to fly you to Idaho under personal guard so you couldn\'t run.

Rachel, the newbie, slumped next to James Olson on the Rorschach couch. She might have been fifteen or forty with eggplant-colored skin and dark eyes that looked hollow with fatigue. Her tee shirt read "Give Up the Ghost." Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, catching a glimpse of a wrist with horizontal scars. Like herself and most of the girls in the program. If the scars had been vertical, she wouldn\'t be here.

Get prepared, newbie. Heads are going to turn when you walk down a street in lily-white Coeur d\'Alene where the Aryan Nations headquarters is close enough to throw a rock at you. Get used to your nappy hair because they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife close enough to hurt you will be in the hands of a skinny cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Now the daily argument about who had to process first. Old Girl contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear hanging from the eaves. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the longest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth that framed the Ponderosa-ringed yard. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

Old Girl was eleven when she first tried to kill herself. She raided the medicine cabinet at Uncle David\'s and Aunt Peggy\'s house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was that her guardians were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the universe along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seeds and fish oil jammed the shelves. Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's worst way to go?

At 17, after two years in Adolescents, Old Girl applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to off herself. Nothing gross, for example. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor ---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water expelled so forcefully it burst a blood vessel in one eye \-- now, all fluids were verboten. Double-ditto efforts that involved road rash, like the kind she got when she fell out of Uncle David's Buick on the way home from middle school. She let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door and learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. It wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken femur and the harrowing experience of having gravel hand-picked out of her cheek bone with forceps.

Now that she was older, her urges to kill herself came upon her at moments when she least expected them. She wondered at times if her brain was being rewired while she in the middle of using it. The last time it happened, she remembered thinking it was time to buy a new head for her electric toothbrush. The next thing she knew, she found herself sticking a fork in the outlet to see if she could fry.

All she could think in those moments, the only drumbeat in her head, was \"make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\" If the pain wouldn\'t stop, she had no choice but to open the car door and let gravity take over. On days, like today, when the drumbeat to die, die, die, receded to an I, I, I, of dull pain, she finished her homework and did her chores at Healing House and went to therapy three times with Dr. Hazey, the founder of Inner Horizons. He talked to Old Girl all the time about ways to combat the urge to hoodwink herself out of daylight into perpetual night.

So far, no success.

Lydia Bronfmann lost the argument about who had to introduce themselves with an accountability list so that the newbie could see how everyone at Inner Horizons was taking responsibility for their actions. Lydia was a cutter. She was also a nympho. And a bulimic. And the only child from the Bronfmann beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the Detroit in the list of behaviors she was sing-singing through which started with fucking Axel Friedman. Everybody was mad at Lydia because Axel was the best pitcher on the Inner Horizons soft ball team.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's heinous fees. Why Lydia was apologizing was a mystery. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. She had sex with everybody so it would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat by himself on the loveseat, could count that high.

Lydia seemed to be channeling Marilyn Monroe's breathy voice while she listed behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she was saying. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody had to say."

Darlene rapped a pen on the clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

"How can I take ownership if I don't tell you what I did?" Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by diamond earrings the size of dimes.

"Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Lydia was trying to outdo Dani Cohen, her nemesis. Dani earned a living as a nude dancer to spite her parents who were born-again Christians. The two of them were so self-involved, so clueless about anything else that mattered, Old Girl wanted to choke them with the same rope. The problem was there was no rope at Inner Horizons. No rope, no long scarves, no ties for bathrobes, no leather to hold up a pair of pants (the boys whined about this incessantly). Nothing longer than a shoe lace and even those were kept under lock and key.

Old Girl looked down at her lumpy bumpy laces tied numerous times. She pushed down a rising tide of captive rage. Captive rage was like captor rage, except more vicious. When you had captor rage, there was some dim glimmer of understanding that Charlene, the Night Duty, or Margaret, the Day Supervisor, or Bruce, the Rec Leader, was making eight bucks an hour and didn\'t want to be at Inner Horizons any more than you did. But with captive rage, all that blame was aimed at yourself.

Lydia introduced Old Girl to her first day of captive rage with the phrase, \"Welcome to Youdaho."

Udahoe? Old Girl was so stupid then.

\"No, You-Da-HO.\" Lydia put the emphasis on the last syllable. \"You da crazy fucked up ho who fucked up by getting yourself locked up in bum-fuck Idaho with a bunch of crazy fucks you\'ll never get away from.\"

Even at fifteen, she thought the joke was a lame but the stupid name stuck and people used it every day until it was an ear worm that couldn\'t be shaken.

Now Lydia was telling about how she\'d gotten over on a police officer with a blowjob. Her short black curls bobbed enthusiastically on a childishly thin neck. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene made a note. Flipped briskly to a clean page on the clipboard. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist's shake up after Axel\'s departure.

Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved from Ads to YAs in early January. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized head of Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from D-Day (shortened from Despair Day: April 15, 2015). A Yale degree in psychiatry framed on Hazey's office wall said he graduated in 1986 "with distinction in Youth and Adolescent Behavioral Psychiatry.\" That meant Hazey had to be what... almost fifty? No wonder he was practically senile.

James Olson, the lanky blond surfer from Malibu, was now talking in a low monotone to the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche stoned on weed or poppers--- "basically out of his mind" he'd admitted in one of those tense, shame fests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get up.

"I traded my Revos for the candy," said James.

Then Darlene wanted to know how he could afford Jelly Bellies on \$5-a-week snack allowance.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high. Darlene tried to get him to rat out the person he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, his roommate and a meth-addicted motor-mouth, had supplied the candy because Reza's New York Jets cap had the Revos hanging off the back. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. After three months without running, YAs had the \"privilege\" of taking 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks on the trade. All James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy on his weekly Family Call that he lost his sunglasses and they'd FedEx him another pair. Ching-ching-ching. A galaxy of Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, a drip beaded and rolled down the icicle. It hung at the tip as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions.

At Inner Horizons, you were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards if you screwed up. If you earned a demerit, say, for being late to Process Group or failed to take the trash out or you fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed or you refused to participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during therapy, the clock would turn around and run backward and taunt you as it ran. Old Girl had had the bitter experience of looking forward to a weeklong trip home to visit Aunt Peggy and Uncle David. Just when she was close to getting sprung, the crazy clock rewound and she found herself \"unsafe without supervision\" and stayed trapped in Idaho ever since.

The wall thermometer outside read 28 degrees. At breakfast, it was 23 degrees. Yippee! Idaho's definition of spring.

During clean-up, she'd overheard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the fix-it guy to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery.

How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The insistence in Margaret's voice made the timing seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who seemed to pick up trash whenever he felt like it. He stunk and he drove a rackety ancient truck stacked with double rows of barrels that smelled just as bad. Maybe melting was the key. The icicle dripped moisture during the day when it warmed up, then refroze at night.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her suicide tries ---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straight copper hair fan out like a sun storm in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process of dreads had squeezed the color out of her hair. Now it looked dull as cardboard. Lack of blood would lighten her freckles; she supposed. Would it also flatten out the bump in her nose?

Old Girl was so tired. She had a hard time sleeping because her mind kept fabricating scenes of her death. She liked scenarios that were as plot driven as mysteries. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Miu-Miu dresses. Weather might be dark and creep-meister or gray as grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she imagined a fishing boat that steamed on oblivious to a body dropping out of the sky. Tragedy didn't always have to slap you in the face.

"Old Girl, wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice cut into her daydream. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle," Darlene said.

Old Girl didn\'t want to come back in the circle. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally wanted to be left alone. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, this new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she be Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?"

The pleasures of double homicide-suicide flitted through her head as she swiveled dutifully back to the fringes of the group.

Old Girl blinked. The droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time Lydia, James, Dani and Big Paul processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism. If it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it.

When it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged her to share something meaningful with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced outside, then up at the ceiling, as if she was looking for some escape. She wondered if Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's had aged her.

Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to make herself smaller. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills.

The girl stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

Darlene vaulted from her chair. "Get Bruce!" Pointing at Lydia, she shouted, "Call 9-1-1!"

By then, Rachel was jerking and convulsing like a puppet. Her head knocked the floor and her legs kicked and flailed.

Old Girl found herself at Rachel's side gripping her by her ears. She held tight trying to stop the horrible sound of skull cracking hard wood. James Olson knelt opposite her, His white-knuckled hands pressed down on her shins.

Could James feel the new girl\'s bolt of electricity like she could? When she laid hands on her, she could feel the electricity coursing through the wire that was Rachel's body. The jolting and sparking was deeply unnerving. It made Old Girl want to run at the same time that her hands were stapled to Rachel\'s body.

Jesus, she was thinking. Get me out of here!

From the stricken look in James' blue eyes, she understood that he was feeling the same shock and awe and horror.

Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck. How can I hold this girl to the earth when I can barely hold onto myself?

Until that instant, running away from Inner Horizons had always been in Old Girl\'s mind as a fuzzy possibility. Like every other resident, she hated and loathed the Program and woke up every morning believing she couldn\'t stand one more day. For once, the constant psychobabble about self- actualization and self-denial and self-development and self-knowledge and self-education and self-preservation made her acutely aware that the only way to save her sorry self was to run.

No more shilly-shallying. Run tonight.

Shilly-shallying\--where had that come from? Shilly-shallying was something her mother would have said if she wasn\'t now a greasy spot on the railroad tracks with Dad and baby Gabe after being shoved into a train by a geriatric driver who slammed into them from the rear. No shilly-shallying there. Nothing left but gristle and bone when it came time to bury them, according to a matter-of-fact Aunt Peggy who conveyed this nugget of information on the phone to her best friend the day after it happened when she thought Old Girl was out cold with a sedative on the couch.

Now her attention was back on Rachel\'s surprisingly firm neck. The dark backs of her hands with palms as pink as rabbit ears thumped the floor while her heels beat their own crazy tattoo.

Shilly-shallying is done . Go now.

By the time the fit finally stopped, Darlene and Bruce, the driver, scurried around with Margaret directing traffic until they got Rachel's limp body loaded into the van. Darlene decided they should drive her to the emergency room at Kootenai General which was faster than waiting for an ambulance to drive out 15 miles to Healing House, then drive another 15 miles back to the hospital.

In all the hustle and hoo-ha getting out the door, Darlene forgot her purse.

Old Girl spotted it next to the wingback chair where Darlene had been sitting at Process Group. She reached to grab it but Lydia scooped up the bag first.

The little shit!

In the top was a wallet. A twenty peeked a green corner out like a promise. Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia plucked the twenty and palmed it in one smooth motion while calling out loudly, \"Darlene! Your purse!\"

Damn that Lydia. Always a step ahead when it came to herself. Old Girl could have used the money to add to the minuscule stash of cash she had painstakingly amassed by over months. She got \$25 for selling her North Face jacket worth \$250 bucks to an Indian girl who looked like she needed it more than Old Girl did. How \$36. 58 was going to get her to Seattle, she had no idea.

Darlene took the bag, thanking Lydia profusely. Lydia smiled sweetly, flashing Old Girl a middle finger behind her back. She moved past James, bumped him on the ass, then slid into the bathroom off the kitchen.

Old Girl sighed. Another sexcapade in the making. Did James and Lydia think people were blind to their hook-ups? Apparently.

\#

TWO

HAZEY CALLED MARGARET INTO HIS OFFICE at 9 AM. Gretchen, the nutritionist, shot her a Grinchy smile. Shit in a shoe! Had the witch ratted Margaret out for saying the oatmeal sucked?

Margaret needed her crappy, low paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional psychiatric treatment facility West of the Mississippi." That's what she\'d heard Darlene, who'd been trying to land another job for months, say to a colleague on the phone.

Margaret couldn't afford to leave, no matter how crappy the pay. Her husband, Hank, ruptured a disk moving a 300-pound patient at his job as a nurse at Benewah Health more than a year ago. They'd been living on one income ever since. The taxes on their 10-acre farm were due next month. She had no idea how she was going to pay them.

Hazey sat enthroned behind his gleaming walnut desk. Not a paper on it. Only a folder and an expensive gold fountain pen the shape of a scepter.

\"Gretchen said you contravened her authority and questioned her personal worth in front of the residents.\" How Hazey loved his big words with chewy syllables. In fact, what Margaret had said to Gretchen Beener, possibly the only trained dietician in the world who couldn't follow a recipe for oatmeal, was, \"Are you trying to poison them? This shit tastes like charcoal."

\"The oatmeal was burned,\" Margaret said carefully. \"The kids were complaining. They said it tasted foul.\"

\"They\'re always complaining,\" he said. \"They\'re kids.\"

Well, Hazey had that right. Even though all the kids in the program had psychiatric issues, they were still kids, at heart. Quick to laugh at Margaret's dumb jokes. Quick to piss and moan. Quick to point out the disappointing behavior of adults. Like her own kids in their teenage years, just more fucked up.

\"I\'m a really good cook,\" Margaret said. "I could take over breakfast. Gretchen's always complaining she doesn\'t have enough time for meal planning.\" Really, she was always complaining that she needed a cigarette, which perhaps accounted for the fact that every taste bud on her tongue was dead.

Hazey frowned down at a glossy color brochure with a picture of a tropical blue ocean and palm trees for so long Margaret wondered if he had forgotten she was there.

She waited a while. When he didn't say anything, she finally asked, "Is everything OK?\"

He looked up with an air of mild surprise. \"I need a vacation,\" he said. \"The stress is killing me.\"

Doctor Hazey did not look stressed. He reclined in a big leather chair with his feet on the desk. At 49, the same age as Margaret, he looked like he took care of himself a lot better than she did. A tall tweedy man with gelled salt-and-pepper hair, he wore his usual professorial sport jacket with suede elbow patches and pressed slacks. The paisleys on his tie orbited crazily like red eyeballs.

Margaret couldn't take her eyes off the shoes that were thrust in her field of vision. One was a black wingtip with a shiny, flesh-colored sole. The other shoe was brown. A wingtip, but scuffed on a worn dark sole.

"Dr. Hazey, do you know your shoes don\'t match?\"

He slid the palm trees over a fraction of an inch and peered at his feet. They looked like two narrow barges on the lake of the desk. The shoe news seemed to take a long time to reach his brain. \"I can\'t meet Lydia Bronfmann's mother in these.\"

Lydia's mom was making a fly-by? The only family that Margaret knew about were Lydia's paternal grandparents, the ones who made a fortune in liquor in Michigan. Margaret racked her brain. She couldn't recall Lydia receiving phone calls or letters from anybody else.

"Don\'t her grandparents had custody?"

Hazey shook his head without a hair moving. "Her mother has custody but she has to see Lydia once a quarter or she loses it."

In Sandpoint, Idaho, where Margaret grew up, custody was where they took you in the back of a police car to the Cottonwood penitentiary.

"Lydia said she wouldn't talk to her." Hazey sighed and flipped to a page of elderly sunbathers without wrinkles baking near a cerulean sea.

"Look on the bright side. She probably won't notice your shoes," Margaret said.

The shoe crisis co-opted whatever Hazey meant to say to her. Ten minutes after she was called into his office, Margaret found herself behind the wheel of Hazey's Lexus SUV. She was amazed to drive a car with heated leather seats. Only 1200 miles on the odometer!

It was easy to spot Hazey's glass and concrete house on the west shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene. It was the only aggressively contemporary place in a neighborhood of log houses that were built to look like cabins but were five times larger than the one Margaret had grown up in.

Margaret's lower back whinged at the size of the enormous river-blue and rusty slate driveway. It was the only spot of color in a uniformly snowy neighborhood. Hank couldn't lift a bag of dog food since the accident so she'd spent an hour that morning shoveling out the rutted country lane so she could get to work.

She stepped out of the Lexus onto a driveway dry as a desert. Did Dr. Hazey have an oasis where the sun shone only on his house? Shit and crackers! It hit her. Dr. Hazey had a *heated* driveway.

Normally the fact that Hazey made more money than she and Hank would ever see in a lifetime didn't bother her. But the thought of a raise \--was 5% too much to ask? \-- did cross her mind.

Hazey was fond of saying that Inner Horizons was an albatross around his neck. In a bad mood, it was also a vampire that sucked his blood.

Quite a bit of blood had been sucked to build the glassed-in, two-story entry. Polished dark cherry floors. Oriental rugs. Margaret's dream of having an electric garage door opener embarrassed her for the poverty of her imagination.

By the time she passed not one but *two* white sofas that would have stayed clean in Margaret's house for five minutes, she was convinced Hazey truly was insane.

She found the master bedroom in the back of the house. Forty-some pairs of shoes were arranged in the closet in deep mahogany cubbyholes. Anybody could make Dr. Hazey's mistake with so many pairs of shoes, she told herself. But the chandelier in the walk-in space was big enough to light up Spokane. Who on earth would put a chandelier with a million crystals in it where no one could see?

Black wingtip in hand, she was about to leave by the side door in the kitchen when she heard the clang-clang of garbage bins. Rusty Harrow\'s big green truck squatted in the driveway. The bed was piled high with trash barrels. Rusty ran the dump and picked up trash at all the Inner Horizon's buildings because unincorporated Kootenai County was too cheap to vote for garbage service.

Then Margaret spotted Rusty himself, head down in Hazey's garbage bin. He was pawing through it and holding up junk for inspection to see if there was anything salvageable to sell.

Margaret hesitated, hidden behind the curtain.

There was no reason on earth not to march out of the kitchen door with Hazey\'s shoe, get in the Lexus, and drive back to work. All she had to do was nod at Rusty. Say something polite. \"How\'s it going?\" \"Fancy meeting you here.\" \"Long time no see.\"

She snorted. Having a normal conversation with Rusty Harrow was like having a normal conversation with Dr. Hazey. You just never know what strange journey you\'d might go on.

Was she embarrassed at watching the man eat half a salami that Hazey had tossed in the trash? He was the one who should be embarrassed. Maybe that was it. Margaret felt sorry for Rusty and didn\'t want him to know she\'d seen him eating out of garbage. He wasn\'t so far gone from humanity that he wouldn\'t care, was he?

Something was off about Rusty Harrow. There was something off about all the Harrows, starting with the old man, Stan Harrow, who bought the land for a dump back in the fifties. It was hidden on the other side of the butte from Healing House, about a mile and a half as the crow flies, but five miles away by road.

Stan beat the crap out of those kids. Three of the Harrow boys were older than Margaret. Rusty was in her grade in elementary school and they continued in class together until he dropped out of high school. She still remembered him coming to school with occasional bruises. Once when she sat behind him in the 8^th^ grade, a trail of dried blood ran out of his ear.

These days, you'd call CPS.

Back then, everybody turned a blind eye. What people did at home was their business.

No wonder Rusty's brothers and the one sister--- Helga? Helen?--got the hell out as soon as they could. All except Rusty who'd inexplicably stayed on. When Stan died in a trailer fire, Rusty took over the dump and eked out a living picking up trash from folks who paid him under the table.

Now and again, she'd see him at one of the six repurposed private homes that around Coeur d'Alene that served as dormitories beyond Healing House. He was still driving his old man's ancient stake-bed truck. Amazing that the old junker still ran. She hadn't talked to him in years, other than to yell at him for leaving the empty bins overturned in the drive.

He looked more like Margaret than she cared to admit. He\'d put on quite a few pounds. He'd always been stocky, but now his black, greasy hair was graying and he had a beer gut. His shoulders were big and strong from a lifetime of hefting trash barrels. Margaret could still remember the musty stink that trailed him through the halls at school. Was he still allergic to bathing?

Damn. The smell of smoke wafted past Margaret's nose. It was coming from the cat door. Now Rusty was on a smoke break.

Oh, the hell with it. Why not water Hazey\'s neglected house plants until Rusty went on his trash-eating way?

Margaret dutifully filled a juice pitcher and gave the gasping poinsettias on the dining room table a drink. Here it was late January and Hazey\'s Christmas decorations were still out. She cleaned a bunch of leaf litter off the mahogany. Then, remembering a sad spider plant in Hazey\'s bathroom, carried her juice pitcher of salvation back to the master bed room.

A certain dishevelment had cropped up in Hazey's dress after his wife, Alma, left him. His bed was unmade. A pair of worn pajama bottoms lay on the carpet where he'd stepped out of them. She preferred thinking about Hazey as an overspending, luxury-flaunting chucklehead than a lonely, aging, slightly down-at-the-heels man who was unraveling at the seams as badly as his pajamas. There were some things you really didn\'t want to know about your boss.

When she spotted the medicine cabinet, she thought she\'d grab an aspirin to deal with her aching back. She opened one of the double-doors and did a double take.

Holy shit!

Hazey\'s cabinet was stocked like the drug cabinet at Healing House that was kept locked for its residents. Margaret\'s first thought was that Hazey must be dying. HIV/AIDS? But Hazey was completely asexual. Uninterested in either sex. So that didn't fit.

Bottles of Klonopin. One of Atavan. Diazepam. Valium. Delaudid. Tirazepam. Clonazepam. Margaret read one label. It was prescribed to April Cohen whom Margaret remembered as the girl from the Bronx with terrible anorexia. Her investment banker dad moved his daughter to McLain when Harvard opened their new eating disorder wing.

The prescription on a bottle of Adderall was written to Reza Silverstein. Reza was the ADHD kid from Camden, New Jersey, who couldn't sit still for love nor money. A week or so ago, Hazey had been bragging about how he'd lost twenty pounds "just like that!" He punctuated how the pounds he\'d gained flew off with a snap of his fingers. Just say no! he told her. Was her boss saying No to food because he\'d said Yes to Reza\'s Adderall?

Angela Livengood's name showed up on a bottle of Lorazepam on a lower shelf. Margaret's maternal hackles went up.

Old Girl had a hell of a time sleeping. The kid was famous with the Night Supervisors as a card shark. It was common knowledge that if you needed help staying awake on your shift, all you had to do was walk by Old Girl's room. She'd hustle out at all hours ready with a deck of cards.

Margaret liked Old Girl. She was wickedly funny. Never complained. It would have been better if Old Girl bitched and moaned or even howled at the moon. Anything to help her depression.

Right before Process Group that morning, Old Girl had asked Margaret about falling icicles. She wanted to know if they were dangerous.

"You're not thinking of standing under one, are you?" Margaret asked.

"What---you think I've got a hole in my head?"

"No, but I think you might want one."

"You never let me get away with anything!"

Old Girl lipped one floppy deadlock away off her forehead and sighed. "Of all the nut houses in the world, I get the one with Mother Fucking Teresa."

"Who would I have to bug if you weren't around?" Margaret had said.

By the time, Margaret was finished with her inventory, she counted 89 prescriptions of a psychotropic nature in Dr. Hazey's Pleasure Chest, the majority for kids who had left the program.

The rumble of Rusty\'s truck departing registered dimly but her brain was busy solving the conundrum of the drug stash in Dr. Hazey\'s bathroom. No time to waste time worrying about crazy Rusty Harrow.

Dr. Hazey was using and then writing new prescriptions for any drugs he wanted in the names of kids he\'d treated. Those records were kept in Hazey\'s office. Margaret knew this because she cleaned his office every week and she also knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the right-hand drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and handy to anybody else who wanted to know what he didn't want them to know but was too lazy to hide.

What the hell was going on with Hazey and where was his housekeeper? Margaret saw nine Grape-nuts-encrusted cereal bowls in the kitchen sink. In the fridge, there was a carton of milk and two bottles of Röderer champagne. Margaret's Costco-stocked cupboards and jars of home canned fruit plus a freezer full of Sausage, the pig Hank had raised and butchered last fall, made her life look pretty full. Did the man eat out every meal except breakfast?

What a life.

She was so shaken by her discovery, she forgot the damn shoe she'd been sent for. She remembered it on the way out of the gated lake community by the sign that said Kootenai Reserve. Reserved for everybody but the Kootenai Indians, it meant.

The shoe was on the kitchen counter where she left it. Size 13 Triple EEE Brooks Brothers, with a hole worming its way through the sole.

Hazey. He was crazy as a loon, she supposed, but he was her loon. Now what in creation was she going to do about it?

She rearmed the alarm system and then stepped out on the porch and nearly jumped out of her skin. A long coil of salami wrapping looked just like a coiled snake at her feet. A calling card from Rusty Harrow. Shit on a shiny shingle. Dr. Hazey could pick up his own trash if he wasn\'t too drugged to see it.

How in the hell was she going to get Hazey to stop that shit and fly right? No wonder Inner Horizons was a mess. The boss was writing prescriptions for people who weren\'t even there.

Margaret powered down I-90 on a mission. Mission? Hell, jihad. No! Arma-damn-geddon.

THREE

ONE OF THE STUPID FAMILY STORIES Dad loved to tell was the day he had to leave a company board meeting because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to preschool like a house afire and Jamesy and the Schwarzenegger kid are eating PB&Js and drinking grape juice," Dad liked to say. "There's the Schwarzenegger with his arm around James, drinking out of the same glass. That night, Maria Shriver calls up and says James left a perfect bite mark on the kid's butt. So I tell James to bite his tongue next time. Or at least wait till after the board meeting."

As if James could control his urge to act which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. No planning involved. The impulse came. He bit down.

It was only later, like the moment he stared at the crazy pattern in the safety glass of a shattered windshield, that he realized it wasn't as fun as it looked.

"What the shit?" he cried, when the new girl whose name he'd forgotten, landed in his lap during Process. Her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at the black girl's attractive face upside down. Her pupils rolled up in her head like a window shade; the whites were mapped with tiny red capillaries he couldn't follow.

Half sprawled on James, half on the carpet, the girl flopped violently like a carp. Everybody in Process perched on the edge of their seats and watched the show as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between thankfulness that the seizure put an end to the accountability bull shit and truly appalled at the sight of Old Girl practically kneeling on the new girl's elbows while Darlene grappled her by the jaw.

James laid hands on her thin, long legs and he felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if she were being electrocuted. Her heels beat against the floor while James held on with all his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying-on of hands on a person seized by electricity\-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. This girl's body had a will and an agenda all its own. He glanced over one shoulder at Lydia and tried to catch her eye, wondering if the bodily high jacking shook her as much as it shook him. Lydia was plucking at a cuticle and didn\'t look up.

The fit seemed to go on forever, until a bone-jarring shiver started at the girl\'s head and rolled through her body the way a dog shook off water. Hazel eyes -- a bruise-darkened green -- popped open. The girl glanced around the circle of faces and James had the impression she was thinking she'd woken up in hell. Consciousness spread slowly, followed by a deep blush of shame. The monster is out of the closet, and it is me.

"Are you OK?" Darlene was asking. James squeezed one hand, feeling fingers thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then caught his eye and let go as if she'd been burned.

By the time, Darlene and Bruce and Margaret got her loaded into the van, Process Group was officially toast.

They spent the rest of the time replaying the moment when the new girl lost it. Lydia said the girl fell in James' lap because she wanted to give James a blowjob. "I thought I'd have to fight her off."

Reza, his annoying motor-mouth roommate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants.

"Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

Old Girl was pissed. "They must have known Rachel was epileptic!" she cried. "What the fuck's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than let her rip him a new asshole with her razor tongue. The girl was scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. She had an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he had grown familiar with at the bottom of a tequila bottle. "Careful of what?\" he asked. \"Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

Paul, the silent Asperger wizard, spoke in a rusty voice. "She looked like the Exorcist."

You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like he was a ghost.

"What are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

People laughed and Paul went back to doodling equations on the back of his hand.

Lydia bumped James from behind, the sign she wanted to have sex. How could you think about sex when you were shaken to the core?

Like Lydia, Dad, CEO of Life Monitor, a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, and a neurosurgeon, were both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, had reminded him in the session before Process. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked him. James's answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

Last week on their weekly Family Call, James's Mom asked him why he did the shit he did. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time," was the only answer that made any sense to him.

When he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on weed or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka \-- it didn\'t seem to James that he had trouble staying on task or that he was easily distracted. He did great at basketball and track.

Once, in a good moment with Dr. Mom, he asked her why he and Susan, his sister, were opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system figures out how to talk to your frontal cortex."

He'd looked up the limbic system. As he understood it, the lizard brain housed all his fears and fuck-ups. The frontal cortex controlled the decision-making parts of his brain. Maybe his was the size of a walnut.

He said as much the day they were eating pizza on the way to his basketball game and Dr. Mom said, " Oh, no, James. That's not the problem. Your cortex is the right size. I could show you on an MRI. It just doesn't talk to the rest of your brain yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections. "Time," she said in her matter-of-fact way. "Only time makes the brain connect." She sighed. "And good genes."

Maybe that's why Susan did so well. She had the high round Olson forehead. All those genes and connections she inherited had programmed her to get straight A's in AP classes when he barely made it into Cal State despite a basketball scholarship.

Plain freckled Susan did exactly what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by every text or IM from his pals. Lydia's demand that he meet her for stand-up sex in the bathroom even though he was beginning to hate the sight of her, was no different. Susan would have said, "I have to study for my Calc test," while James\' Pavlovian response was always, "F3A3."

Fuck yeah, anytime, anywhere, any place.

Today, with Lydia? Not so much.

FOUR

LYDIA WAITED FOR JAMES IN THE UNHEATED BATHROOM off the kitchen. She was standing in a cast iron tub the size of an iceberg. Naked from the waist down, she felt like she was orphaned on a block of ice.

In two hours---exactly one hour and 56 minutes, according to her Piaget watch, a birthday present from Grandpa Ben ---Lydia's mother Rahel was coming to visit . If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart.

She'd already checked her wallet. The \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse was safely tucked away. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black Goth nails and replace them with perfect white crescents. It cost \$60 bucks for a French manicure on New York's upper East Side and \$15 in Coeur d'Alene. The only good thing about YouDaHo.

Looking around at the oak veneer in the faux country bathroom---even the toilet seat was blond oak---Lydia made a note to herself to remember to stash her cheap-ass Betsey Johnson tote knock-off on Esty's side of the room.

Her mother had drilled it into her head that only poor people wore fakes. People with money know what\'s real.

Lydia had studied in Lausanne, Switzerland, at a girl's school for four years; went to private school for three years in Grosse Point when she lived with Grandpa Ben and Grandma Adele; then during a brief fling Rahel had with a Superintendent of Public Schools, she attended public school in Manhattan for less than a semester. Rahel took her out of PS #6 in a NY minute the day Lydia came home with head lice. Most of high school was spent back in Switzerland at another girl's school, this one in Zurich, where they taught her how to dress in deportment classes and she taught herself how to undress under the lacrosse bleachers with the assistant coach.

Even in authentic Jimmy Choos, Rahel would be faster than Lydia in Nikes. Her mother kept herself tiny as a ferret and she was always harping on Lydia to lose weight. If Lydia's weight went up two pounds, it was social suicide. What man would want you if you were fat?

The first thing Lydia planned to do after Rahel took off on Grandpa Ben's Lear jet was to stop in at Dunkin' Donuts and stuff herself with every cake donut and cream cruller on the shelf. She would imagine her mother looking down through the clouds at thirty-thousand feet while her daughter scarfed donut after donut. Then Lydia would open her mouth and vomit everything she'd swallowed into the maw of the second hand purse her mother had "refitted" for her birthday. That's what I think of your stinking birthday present, Mom.

What in hell was keeping James?

She pushed away the image of the new girl's head thumping the floor. The sightless eyes rolled up white in a thin gorgeous face. The wild drumming of her jerking feet. Lydia's Godzilla itch for sex, as relentless and bad as it was, was at least hidden on the inside of her body, out of sight with all the other horrible things she kept locked up. Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside while the world outside saw a petite and perfectly maintained body.

She had been hoping the new arrival last week would be a boy. Erase that. A hella-boy with a hella-Godzilla-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed on Friday morning when a tall, bleary-eyed black girl named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her she could only have herbal tea!

Inner Horizons was full of stupid rules. They were just as stupid as the boys who never wanted anything to do with Lydia besides sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped, the smell of sex trailing after them like skunk. Guys, including James were clueless. What a bunch of a spud duds. Once they got laid, did they realize she had nothing else to give? What else would you give a guy when you already gave them access to your body? No clue.

Yesterday after marathon monkey sex in the girl's restroom at Northern Idaho Community College when she was supposed to be in Sociology class, James had muttered, "I feel dirty."

She felt like he'd slapped her. "I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's..." James thought for a long moment as if trying to order his thoughts. "You're like a Hoover. So mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels ... ah... impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

James dangled a spent condom between his fingers like a rat corpse. What the shit, the thing was filled with his own sperm. You make me feel used, he told her.

That was how Lydia was feeling the longer James kept her waiting. She couldn't make up her mind whether she was Jonesing more for sex or for a confetti-covered cake donut. Both would go down in two minutes and but only one of them would come back up in a satisfying swirl of green and blue and pink.

That was the real reason she was locked up in Idaho.

Her orthodontist in Grosse Point ratted her out to Grandpa Ben and Grandma Adele when he told them that the back sides of her teeth were pitted as a middle-aged woman. What a shit show. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food, but there was no fucking way she could ever let herself be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was always so empty. No wonder when she looked in the mirror, she was always surprised to see her that she was there.

When she was young, Lydia had loved to look at herself in the mirror.

Her first memory was of skating down the long mirrored hall of the big house in Grosse Point calling \"Mom\'s coming. Mom\'s coming!\" Her nanny had told her that her mother was coming home from Europe. For hours, four year old Lydia skated the main hall in her bare socks. Back and forth. Back and forth.

Grandma Adele finally told her she\'d wear out the floorboards if she didn\'t quit. What was funny about the memory is that Lydia remembered almost nothing about her mother's actual visit. A cloud of perfume, maybe. Her mother\'s low, assessing voice. \"My, you\'re not very big,\" she said, as if her size was somehow Lydia's fault.

It was the expectation of being judged that stuck with her. Her hair was too curly. Or her legs were too thin. Or her voice had too much Detroit in it. Once, Lydia heard her mother refer to her as "the little Jew." She learned later that it was the mother's blood that defined Jewishness and her comment didn't make sense.

It wasn't till much later, when she lived with her mother in New York, that she learned to have no expectations. Why she had such a visceral memory of watching herself slide along the waxed floor, she had no idea. That day, it felt like she was flying with her hands out ready to catch the thing that was coming with great joy.

It was only when she got it that she realized her hands were empty.

By the time James finally shoved the shower rings to the side, Lydia was already clawing her way up his long, thin body and scissoring her legs around his waist. She groped at his waist, trying to undo his belt buckle and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!" She really felt like the top of her head was going to blow off. She couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was halfway down his throat.

Suddenly, the bathroom door banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtain-ringed tub and settled on the toilet. James' eyes widened and locked with Lydia's and they both froze. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting when they heard the thunder of water in the toilet, then a quick flush.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard.

The door closed behind whoever it was and a pent-up laugh flew out of Lydia's mouth like a caged bird.

"Shit." James breathed into her ear. "That was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands, keeping them still.

"I can't. That new girl... I thought she was dying," James held her away from his body with stiffened arms.

I'm dying, Lydia thought, feeling an unfamiliar moment of empathy for the epileptic girl who'd just had her body kidnapped by a seizure. Her emptiness was unbearable enough without any flopping or jerking.

"You don't have to think! Just feel!" She thought he was kidding and tried again to haul at his belt buckle. "C'mon!"

"No! What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" She patted his zipper, looking for evidence of welcome. She found none and said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way she was flopping?"

Lydia tightened her thighs, wiry and toned from years of gymnastics and ballet, into a death grip. But James, who was a foot taller and ten times stronger, pushed her relentlessly down past his knees like a donut.

"Don't hold out on me!" she wailed.

"I'm not. It's just ..." James hesitated.

In the pause, she shot up and slapped his face as hard as she could.

"What the hell?" His cheek flushed bright red where her blow had lit his skin like a flare. "Why'd you do that!?"

"I need it!"

The flush reddened like a trouble light. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly turning me on."

"Limp dick!"

" What? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

"Fucking dickless wonder!"

They were both huffing like whales at the surface. Lydia felt a rising volcanic pressure in her chest that made it hard to breathe.

James was already backing away from her. He stepped out of the tub and the rings jangled like an alarm bell.

"You can't get it up!" she cried. "You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked with surprise.

"You weren't calling me names an hour ago!" James was talking about the quickie she gave him before breakfast up against the back wall of Healing House's garage while they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins the night before.

That was then, this is now, she thought. "Faggot!"

James had his hand on the white, porcelain door knob and for a deranged instant, Lydia had the impression he was fondling a skull.

"Why would I fuck you?" he said. "You're fucking crazy."

The bathroom door shut. The sound of bumping and clicking ice. Lydia let her body slide down in the tub until her head rested on the white porcelain edge while she felt the ice floe drifting away from land.

MONDAY WAS OUTDOOR ACTIVITY DAY. People were scurrying around, trying to find their snow gear. Old Girl waited at the front door, wool hat pulled over her ears, gloves in pocket, sweating in puffy blue down. She feIt like a preschooler. Where was the mitten leash that slipped through both arms of the jacket and around her neck?

They were supposed to leave by eleven but by the time everybody found all their gear, it would be closer to eleven-thirty.

It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door of the house where she grew up in Portland, Oregon, while Mom wrestled Gabe into his snowsuit. She was five years older than Gabe, so she could dress herself, while the baby had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding his compact square body between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down to cork his foot into a green boot. Back then, Old Girl thought she should hear a pop when the foot finally slipped in. Did it bloop? Or was it more like a thwock? What's the reverse of a champagne cork sound, she thought with sadness. A thwoop?

She couldn't recall what was Gabe doing during all Mom's pushing and shoving. Gabe was a sunny-tempered dark-haired baby -- not a colicky screamer like her, according to Aunt Peggy. But now her mind was as empty of memories of him as an ice-covered lake.

Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember what Dad smelled like any more. He was a builder and she used to be able to call him up in the smell of fresh-cut wood. Now, when she hauled kindling and split logs to fuel Healing House's wood stove, all she smelled was pitch. Dad was gone, escaped up the chimney. Now he seemed even farther away than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a senior citizen had driven a Cadillac into their back end and a train had crushed all three of them.

The sky was the usual color of cement.

When the van finally hammered north on Highway 95 toward Lake Pend Oreille (Pon-der-ay, that's how they said it in Youdaho) everyone was squirrelly with relief. It was a French name from some ancient trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just eleven kids tired of being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the blizzards.

They weren\'t even out of the driveway before James and Lydia got a warning for inappropriate touching. Lydia got a demerit and had to stay behind with Margaret in charge of her. She had a hissy fit but Darlene told her to suck it up and live with the consequences. Now James sat next to Bruce, the driver, his wandering hands far removed from Lydia's crotch. Rachel Cathcart slumped against the window next to him. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but they'd made a detour and picked her up at the Kootenai emergency room after she checked out okay. Old Girl got stuck in the far back of the Suburban AKA Barfland.

Barfland felt glacial. Old Girl was relieved that Lydia wasn't stuck in the back with her. Otherwise she would have had to pretend she was interested in how many times Lydia had traded oral sex for candy in the past week. Blowjobs. Just another word for money in Youdaho, Lydia confided last week.

Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House. Endless blue trees. A landscape where nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About three miles was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature kept dropping.

Bruce told them the plan was to make them snowshoe up to a small lake with an outlet and an inlet at both. It fed into the main Pend Oreille lake. The hike was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head back to the van.

The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt as always like she was being assaulted. Two years before, after Peggy and David dumped her, the first thing she understood had been taken away was a quiet place to hear herself think. For the millionth time, Old Girl missed her iPod, which had been confiscated by Margaret the day she came into the Program. Some asshole had broken into the storage locker where contraband was kept---probably Dani, the klepto---and now it was permanently lost.

Old Girl had dark plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she had found on campus to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

SIX

AFTER HIS WIFE, ALMA, LEFT HIM for a horse whisperer, Dr. August Sanders Hazey often found himself staring at the black and white photo on his office wall. The portrait, inherited from a German uncle, was taken in the early 20^th^ Century. It showed three farmers dressed up on their way to a party. He wished he could go with them.

A neat stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical insurance premiums had to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the sour but ambitious head therapist, remained unread and unsigned.

Dr. Hazey checked the clock again.

Another hour before he could reasonably down another muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck, for his session with Rahel Bronfmann nee---What? The Grosse Point heiress to the Bronfman alcohol fortune had divorced, remarried and then divorced again in the year and a half since Lydia Bronfmann came to the program. How the woman remembered her own name was a mystery.

His plan was to assure Rahel about Lydia's Bronfmann's progress, which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl, a cutter and a bulimic, had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. Lydia had four write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct. The rest of her file was stuffed with carefully coded phrases: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (i.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening (keeping her under lock-and-key worked, up to a point). "Recommend single room" (can't get along with Estie Lattimer, the roommate).

What he could say definitively about Lydia Bronfmann was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were never late.

Parents like Rahel Bronfmann nee \_\_\_? came to Dr. Hazey to be reassured. He'd tried passing off this duty to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist, but Darlene had a problem with brutal honesty. She had no idea how to be reassuring without outright lying. When parents met with Darlene, she of the dour and acerbic personality, there went another monthly check that should have been made out to Inner Horizons and ended up being written to the new Anorexia Unit at Harvard McLain or Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu. Lucky patients there got to surf. God, it was a dog-eat-dog-with-anxieties-world.

Hazey had long ago mastered the trick of hitting the right balance between avuncular reassurance and bypassing the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact almost every adolescent he'd ever met toyed with sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

By the time Rahel Bronfman Fiat (soon to be ex-Fiat, according to Lydia) sailed into Dr. Hazey's office, she was thirty minutes late. She waved a vaguely dismissive hand at him, simultaneously air-kissing Lydia on both cheeks. It flashed through Hazey's mind that perhaps the girl's mother missed her cheeks by an inch because she really couldn't see that she was sitting on her hands on the couch.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A flutter of one impeccably made-up eyelid communicated that Rahel hated Lydia's mop of short black curls. Lydia had stopped straightening her hair soon after filing a formal complaint that she couldn't find a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "It's so... informal." Rahel's low voice had the Detroit scrubbed out of it by a voice coach.

The mother smiled at her daughter holding her delicate nose a touch too high. From the grim expression on Lydia's face, the girl seemed to be thinking about shoving Rahel's false eyelashes up her cosmetically enhanced nostrils. She had two of them, didn't she? Two roads to hell --- that's how Lydia would think.

Rahel was petite and dark-haired, a perfect clone of her daughter or, Hazey supposed, vice versa. Lydia, perched as far as she could get from her mother, shared her tiny bones but she was rounded in a childlike way while her mother looked wiry and lean without an ounce of softness. It looked like Rahel's workout routine was more military than the Marines.

Lydia's mother's first concern was whether her daughter had put on any weight. "Lydia tends to fat, like I do," Mrs. Bronfmann said, patting a haunch as flat as a Greyhound's.

Rahel laid a hand on Hazey's arm---he'd made the mistake of pulling his wing back chair close to her---and he felt like a cream puff awaiting her sharp teeth. "I hope you're helping my little girl," she said. "Lydia's all I have."

"Rahel," Lydia said, "Dr. Hazey isn't my therapist. That's not his area."

Rahel looked surprised. "You're not being treated by the Head of the Program? Is that what you're saying?"

"I asked for a woman therapist," Lydia said. "You know. Because we get along so well." To this enigmatic statement, she gave Rahel a bland and sugar-sweet smile.

Hooboy.

When Hazey tried to probe gently about why Rahel didn't join the weekly calls for Lydia's family therapy, she said airily, "I've been out of the country" as if phones and Skype were yet to be invented.

"Even young adults can feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their therapy," Dr. Hazey said carefully.

"Did she say something about me?" Rachel cried. "I'm a good mother!"

Hazey took the hint and smoothly deflected Rahel by saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfmann---your father? --- is the paternal figure in Lydia's life." Clearly, the key lifetime issue between mother and daughter wasn't going to be solved in a 45-minute conversation between Lear Jet refueling.

"It's so good you're here. Lydia was very surprised when we told her about your visit," Hazey said. This was code for Lydia's crying jag and refusal to meet with her mother until she extorted an art class at NICC out of Inner Horizons, though she hadn't earned that level of freedom. "Would you two like some time to yourself? I can step out of the room."

Both Rahel and Lydia looked at Hazey like he was nuts. "No" Lydia cried, at the same time as Rahel stood and said gaily, "No, no! I'm only here to say hello and drop off Lydia's birthday present. You know she just turned 18 this week."

"Last week," Lydia said. "Mom and I have birthdays in the same month." Lydia smiled another Saccharine smile, adding, "Only now Mom is 17 and I'm older than she is. It's a trick she has of making her birthdays run backwards."

The conversation went downhill after that.

Less than twenty minutes after the start of the meeting, the clack of Rahel's departing heels jackhammered in Hazey's overloaded brain. God, he needed that muscle relaxant. He absolutely mustn't. He had to control himself. He had to absolutely, positively stay awake for his four o'clock appointment with Old Girl.

Hazey called Darlene and told her about the disastrous encounter with Lydia's mother. His next-in-command had the job of triage. Then he lay back in his reclining chair and contemplated the young farmers on the way to their merriment. Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, the only regular patient he still saw was Old Girl. He'd had to drop all his other long-term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of the financial and administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections?

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her. He supposed Lydia Bronfmann would be amazed that he felt the same way about her. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep Old Girl on his crowded schedule though it was hell on his calendar to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include the only patient who made him laugh. Old Girl often surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. If he didn't get through to her, he was afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to jolt the girl out of her suicide ideation.

She seemed to be tolerating a new cocktail of antidepressants but suicide had been a part of her identity so long, he couldn't seem to break her preoccupation with death. It was as if she'd been on the path to her own destruction for so long that walls had built up over her head until the rut she walked was deeper than granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair, even the stars above her were hidden.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit heel. He was also lazy. And unproductive. And he really, really wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for a pick-me-up because he was a professional and he did care, even he mostly didn't act like it.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. He couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a healthy, attractive young woman would wear wooly scraps of hair like a rag bag mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with ten weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she feared her sexuality. She buried it in unisex clothing and let her hair mat into desiccated snakes.

Didn't she want a boyfriend?

Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horizons from becoming a bed hopping swap fest. But maybe he should make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way to celebrate life than to have sex with one of her peers? That boy from Malibu---Justin? Jamison? James?---he was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing a woman with his car, well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a reason for the Inner Horizon rules against fraternization between the sexes. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at NICC now that she had finished the Intensive program and was permitted to take 10 hours of community college classes. If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought.

The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the Atavan.

SEVEN

THE TRAIL TO TWO MOUTH LAKE CLIMBED gently for a mile. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of this hellhole, he wanted to be in shape to play basketball at Cal State. Would the move back home to California be like going from one circle of hell to the next? He'd been working his way through *The Inferno* from the rag-tag library at Healing House, not that he'd ever let about his voracious reading to his parents. They'd long since given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but World of Warcraft.

As they zigzagged up the hillside, James caught views of the blue upper peaks. Grayish-white in the near-distance, white-blue in the distance, until a vastness stretched diamond white and merged with the sky. A stutter flight of a bird was shocked out of a bush by their noise. It winged away in flight with tight claps of its feathers to its body in a syncopated stroke-stroke-stroke and gliiiiiide.

The group griping quieted down once the trail steepened.

James was glad Lydia got left behind at Healing House. She was still in a wicked snit about how James had wrestled her hand away from his crotch in the van, which was how Bruce caught them. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight! The fucktard. Was he a piece of meat? He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Lydia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the women's bathroom at NICC where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (Progress! Dr. Mom enthused on their weekly Family Call.)

He wished he was taking Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Lydia was motivated by the danger rather than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for love, he told himself. It would be nice just to be liked.

The new girl, Rachel, tramped steadily behind him. She was keeping up with him and they were way ahead of the pack so he assumed she was in pretty good shape. He'd heard she was into ballet. Old Girl, who was dogging their heels, was also in shape but she didn't count because she spent hours on the treadmill every day. James always had to hand over his allowance so she'd let him have an extra forty-five minute run. Five bucks for a weekly allowance! What kind of trouble could you get in with that? James remembered the day he turned eight and Dad handed him \$50 for his first allowance. The look on Mom's face when she found all the licorice he hid under his bed.

Giant snow-heavy Ponderosa pines pinched off light on the trail. It felt claustrophobic. A whumph of snow dropped from a branch in a blinding plume that made him jump.

James was always cold in Idaho. When you grew up in Malibu, shorts and flip-flops were all you wore to armor yourself against the day. Idaho required a full body suit of flannel and wool and two-inches of down. Sometimes it felt so thick, it felt like he was choking. Today, though, he was sweating. He threw off layers of down and wool and polyester that smelled rank and disgusting. He'd expected a sense of freedom or at least largeness when Mom and Dad told him they were sending him to the Idaho wilderness "to grow up." Instead, he felt small and inconsequential, a mere speck, in thousands of miles of trees and mountains and ice that stretched to forever.

"Slow down!" somebody in the back yelled. Rachel stepped on the back of James' snowshoe and he almost fell over. "Sorry!" she said. James knelt to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the straps. "It's okay, I was dreaming."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she was worried about breaking Inner Horizon's endless rules. They'd gotten the mandatory stay-together lecture at the trailhead. James had heard it fifty times, even at the bowling alley.

Old Girl stepped out of the trail and skirted around them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "Don't sweat it," he said to Rachel, "It's OK as long as the three of us hang together."

He tramped steadily upward, glad to work on his endurance. The stillness was disconcerting. No foot tracks. A soft skitter of some four-footed creature's footpads. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone, who lived at the end of their street. What he'd really like to see is a wolf though he'd settle for an elk. Something majestic. If he saw an elk, he'd have something he could talk about on the weekly Family Torture call.

James parents were always asking him why he never thought about the consequences. Generally, he thought, "Hey, this'll be rad!" Or "Whooee!" Lately, when he woke up gasping with his heart going 180 beats a minute, he wondered if the fun had ever been worth it.

If that was the life lesson he was fated to repeat, how could he bear it?

His parents should just give it up and accept that James was a fuck-up and a loser. Not everybody could be like his sister with her astronomical SAT scores. James had endured a week of agonizing dinnertime angst hoping that his scores had gotten lost on the way to Siberia.

He checked the mail faithfully back then but once he started coming home drunk and stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks?

A shit load, it turned out.

EIGHT

LYDIA FORTIFIED HERSELF FOR HER MOTHER\'S VISIT with Seven for Mankind jeans, a Miu-Miu blouse and over-the-knee black Ferragamo boots. It was just that in her hollowed out, state, she kept having the out-of-body experience of getting smaller until she couldn't feel her weight on the couch.

When it came out that the reason for Rahel's visit was that her mother wanted to take her out of the Program so that she could control Lydia's maintenance allowance and live on her funds until her next divorce settlement, Lydia was surprised that her mother asked her what she thought. Rahel's carmine nails played with the gold clasp on her Blenciaga bag and Lydia had a vision of being swallowed up by the black braided leather and being turned into a bag shaped block that would be left on the luggage shelf until someone remembered to retrieve her. Leaving the Program would be great. Leaving her mother in the lurch would be even better.

"So I guess you're stuck with me," she told Dr. Hazey in the silence after the door closed and her mother's heels clicked away from her like a radioactive counter.

Hazey seemed mesmerized by the only open water that remained unfrozen on Lake Coeur D'Alene. The rest of the lake was a white parking lot and ice was relentlessly closing in on a flock of spinning coots that were churning circles in the diminishing space.

"That's good. I think." He seemed to be asking a question.

"I thought you'd be happy that you weren't losing my fees," Lydia said.

"I think your mother will be unhappier at losing your fees than I would be." The slam of the front door gave rise to his ambiguous smile.

"She'll get over it. She always does."

"Hmmm. Is that typical?" Hazey asked.

"What?"

"For your mother to walk out on you?"

"Oh, that was nothing. The last time I saw her, she called me a little pervert and an ingrate."

"So it's not unusual for your mother to lose her cool?"

"That wasn't losing her cool. You should see her when she's really mad." Lydia had seen her throw a Steuben glass bowl and dislocate a man's shoulder.

"What does she do when she's really mad?"

"I didn't see her for three years from the time I was almost 15 till I was 17."

"Want to tell me about that?"

"Not particularly."

Hazey sighed. He went to the locked file cabinet behind him and rifled through the B's till he found the Bronfmann file. He paged through the bulging folder before he found what he was looking for. "It says here that your grandfather charged your mother for lack of supervision for a minor and maintaining an unhealthy environment." The file also said that Rahel Bronfmann's finance had been caught in bed with her daughter by Lydia's nanny.

"So she blamed you for the failure of her marriage?"

"Why do you think she called me an oversexed little ingrate?"

"Is she getting back at you by getting access to your finances?"

"She isn't too good with money, like she said."

"Actually, I think she's pretty darn good with money. She knows how to get it when she needs it."

The coots on the edge of the circle somehow managed to work their way into the inner circle so that the ones on the outside in the cold could depend on getting warm. Lydia wasn't sure how the system worked but sit seemed elegant and well-oiled for survival.

"Just out of curiosity, how big *is* your monthly allowance?" asked Dr. Hazey.

"It's not called an allowance any more. Now that I'm 18, they call it a "maintenance allocation." It's \$22,000 a month now that I'm technically an adult. Isn't all this stuff in there?" She gestured to the file.

"It's news to me that you are actually saving your trust fund by being here."

Lydia blinked. "What's it cost to keep me locked up?"

"\$12,000 a month, give or take."

"What's the take?"

"If we send you to Stabilization, you can add another \$3000 to the total."

"Oh, like an annuity?"

One side of Hazey's lip crinkled. "Kind of." After a pause, he asked, "Did you want to have sex with your mother's fiancé'?"

"He was a pig. If it meant she wouldn't marry him..."

"That's a lot of responsibility to put on a 14-year-old girl."

"What do you mean?"

"Saving your mother at 14?"

"No, no. By then I was almost 15. She really couldn't see what a dick he was."

"Did you want to hurt her?"

" I was trying to help. She just didn't appreciate it so she stopped talking to me. That's when Grandpa Ben took over as my guardian and he made me live in Grosse Point."

Hazey leaned toward her. His hands tented in front of his face. "Lydia, you've been at Inner Horizons more than a year now. How would you characterize your progress?"

"I've been fucked up for 18 years. You don't think you can change me in only a year and a half, do you?"

"Actually, I don't think we can change you at all. You're the only one who can do that."

Now it was Lydia's turn to walk over to the window to contemplate the circling coots. She looked at the chuckling birds, then caught sight of the large gold wrapped present her mother had left behind on Hazey's desk. "Can I open my present now? Before she comes back to take it away?"

Dr. Hazey waved her on and she tore into the shiny foil paper. She made swift work of the clump of silver pine coins and red berries attached to a coil of silver fabric ribbon. In an interior box, she peeled back a nest of snowy white tissue that covered a framed picture.

Lydia leaned in to peer at the image. Her stomach lurched sideways.

Lydia's mother was sitting on a yacht in Portofino harbor next to a dark haired man with a mustache. The man gazed at her mother in adoration with one hand on her thigh. Rahel was smiling at the camera in the act of raising a glass of straw-colored champagne .

Lydia knew that photograph.

She knew it had been altered.

The original photograph had been taken the day before Rahel and Aldo Fiat were scheduled to be married in Church of St. George in Portofino. But it wasn't Rahel who was sitting on the pristine white yacht floating on blue Mediterranean water. It was Lydia who had next to Aldo on the formed fiberglass bow with the sun setting behind them. Her mother was behind the camera and she had snapped the photo. Now she had somehow excised Lydia from the image as if she didn't exist.

Lydia remembered how Aldo squeezed her adolescent knee in one hairy hand while whispering in her ear, all his attention focused on her. It was Lydia's 14-year-old hand that raised a straw colored glass of ginger ale in the air while in the filigreed frame, it was her mother's 39-year-old face staring back at the viewer with a knowing smile.

A low hum of distress sounded in the room and it took Lydia a second to realize the sound came out of her

Dr. Hazey was watching her closely. "What's upsetting you about this picture?"

How to describe the happiness of that day without going into all the aftermath when Marlene, her east German nanny, walked in on Aldo thrusting at her like a piston in her bed?

"I was there," she said, pointing at the image of her mother. "That's not Rahel. That's me." She put her index finger on the picture, on the place where Aldo was stroking the inside of a thin meatless knee under the fabric of the skirt. She felt the red indentation of those cigar scented fingers. The black hairs that lined the back of his hands which were sparser than the black hairs that she saw coiling around his groin later that night.

Hazey's eye brows knotted with puzzlement as he tried to parse what she was saying. "You mean you were there when the picture was taken?"

"Yes. I was. I mean... no. I was sitting where she is. Mom was taking the picture and Aldo was sitting next to me with his hand on my knee." She stabbed at the large, sausage shaped fingers and looked away from Hazey.

"Mom had the photo retouched to get rid of me."

Lydia initially liked Aldo. He was fun and funny, always joking around with the yacht boys and the masseuse and masseur, telling them dirty jokes that were too old for her in his Italian-accented English. It bewildered he when she woke up to him lying on top of her, kissing her breasts and forcing her legs apart with his knee. She screamed when he started poking at her. It hurt like fire and it felt like he was both suffocating her with his weight and splitting her in two and it was the noises she made to defend herself, even as Aldo pressed one hairy hand over her mouth and hissed at her to take what he she'd been begging for, that woke up Marlene, the nanny, who was sleeping in the next room.

"That's my leg, can't you tell? Look how skinny it is."

Hazey leaned closer and she heard his intake of breath when he saw the adolescent thigh.

"Why would your mother give this to you for your birthday?"

Therapists! Sometimes you had to do all the work because they were just too damn stupid to see what was right in their face.

Lydia shrugged. "Now you can't even tell I was there."

The raised glass of pale bubbles. Aldo's laughing eyes. The delirious regard for the woman whose skirt he was pushing his hand under. Oh, to have never existed on that day the way her mother wanted.

"Your mother is a sick woman," Hazey said. "I hope you see that."

"She may be sick but I'm the one who's here."

"You don't ever have to be in that position again."

Lydia was already closing the white nest of tissue to cover up the image. "You're right," she said. "I doubt my Grandfather will ever let me live with her again."

"What about you, Lydia. Do you want to live with your mother?"

She turned hopeless eyes toward the churning birds that were spinning in the hole that was growing smaller by the flake-filled minute. "Not now. Not today. But most days I do. Crazy, huh?"

"Understandable." Hazey corrected her. "It makes sense."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

Lydia finally asked the question she'd been wanting to ask for years. "Dr. Hazey, is she crazy, or am I?"

"Yes," he said.

"Damn. I was afraid of that."

She changed the subject by asking a final question she'd thought about off-and-on for years, whenever she decided she was making progress in therapy and felt briefly optimistic. "Could you fix her if you worked with her?"

"You mean, if your mother was my patient? If I worked with her in therapy?"

"I know it's never going to happen.... But\--?"

"I don't fix people, Lydia. No therapist does."

"Well, what good are you?"

Dr. Hazey's expression sobered, as if he were thinking about the fucked up relationship between mother and daughter and unhappy with his conclusion.

"I didn't say therapy wasn't helpful. All I said was that change is up to the individual."

"So you must work with a lot of patients who can't change. Doesn't that make you feel like a failure?"

He rolled his eyes. "Out of the mouths of babes..." she heard him mutter under his breath.

He ended the session saying that he would bring Darlene up to speed on Rahel's visit. "No doubt you'll be revisiting this conversation for some time."

For no reason, one of Aldo's hoary old jokes came back to her like a ghost. "Dr. Hazey, do you happen to know the definition of eternity?"

"Can't say I do."

"Two people, a ham, and their relationship with their mother."

NINE

OLD GIRL HEARD THE BOOMING BEFORE she saw it. A tinkling sound like breaking glass. Thrashing and crashing, accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl raced ahead down the blue-shadowed trail that descended to a lake, followed by James who put on speed coming up on her like a sprinter. A thunderous crack. Then came an odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Old Girl had ever heard.

By the time she got to the lake, the moose was already tiring. Cloven hoof prints lead to a jagged-edged dark pool a hundred yards from the lakeshore. A moose floundered in roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. The moose would lunge forward. Its massive wither heaved up onto the shelf and then the ice would break off with its weight. Every time it managed to get up, another ledge of ice would shear off. The black water was dotted with snow clumps that shuddered and bobbed when the creature fell back into the black water and started swimming in circles.

"Holy shit!" James' voice was awestruck.

"What can we do?" Rachel's usually low voice broke high and squeaky. Even in Old Girl's astonishment at the sight of the struggling moose, she registered the fracture. *So she has a heart* flitted through his mind as the moose made another attempt to lunge forward. Its huge antlers raked the snow and its rolling eyes started in terror when it fell.

"Get a stick!" Old Girl clawed at a clump of downed alder trapped in the ice at the shore. She got both hands on a branch and started jumping on it to try to break it out of the ice.

"What good is that? What's it going to hold on with?" James cried.

"Maybe we can get a branch under it. Lever it up somehow." Old Girl beckoned to Rachel and Rachel started jumping with her until the branch splintered and broke.

Even with James and Rachel stomping with her on a stand of alder scrub they couldn't break off a sturdy enough tree to hold its weight. Without an axe or a saw, the green trees defeated them. They had a surprisingly robust will to survive to their own. Was that the way to make it through this life? Put down strong enough roots to survive any storm?

Old Girl hauled a big ass branch toward the hole in the ice but before she got ten steps out on the ice, she felt an ominous crack underfoot. She hesitated. The crack zipped behind and in front of her and the ice she was standing on started to sink. An inch of water started to flow towards her from the shoreline. In seconds, her boot toes were submerged and she felt a spring and wobble underneath her as if the ice was a moving deck.

James, who was a tree length behind her, immediately dropped to his belly. \"Get down!\" he yelled. \"Spread out your weight."

His tone was so loud, so strident, Old Girl obeyed instantly. She felt the spongy ice seem to bounce and flex when her weight spread out enough to allow it to give without breaking.

The tree she\'d thrown out in front of her was pointing toward the dark water which was flowing on top of the ice toward her. It was coming from the hole of darkness where the moose was swimming.

\"Shimmy backwards,\" James ordered. "Now."

Old Girl was crab-walking backwards on her hands and knees---she didn't bother trying to face the shore for fear that ice would give way--- when the moose made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back into churning water choked with floating ice. As they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its shoulders and withers slowly sank under dark surface, Rachel saw the candelabra points of its antlers fired by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above blue-black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly out of sight, the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-clotted hole.

My God, Old Girl thought. Oh, my God.

By the time Bruce and the rest of the group caught up to them on the lakeshore, the water had stopped spinning and the snow clumps barely shivered. Bruce immediately started barking at Old Girl, James and Rachel.

"You were supposed to stay together!" he cried, in a pissed off voice. "Why'd you separate from the group?"

Bruce slapped James with his second demerit of the day. Old Girl got her first demerit of the week. Rachel was awarded her first demerit ever. He cited them all with "poor peer interactions and not following rules." Inner Horizons' arcane system of "consequences" involved numbers from one to four for everything from household chores to therapeutic progress. Murder was the only infraction Old Girl was aware of that was not accounted for on the demerit list.

Rachel started to tell the group about the moose drowning and Old Girl shut her up by slipping sideways on her snow shoes, nearly knocking her to the ground.

"What the hell*?"* Rachel said.

James turned away from the group, busy inspecting the clump of sad aspen saplings that they hadn't been able to uproot. Old Girl stared at Rachel without expression until she took the hint.

"Jesus, watch where you're going!" she said, yanking her basket out from under Old Girl's foot.

Bruce pointed out the jagged hole in the lake like Mr. Wilderness. "Looks like something fell through. Can anybody in the group guess what?"

Old Girl, James and Rachel were silent while the group made a bunch of stupid guesses.

Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big the hole is. You can see its claw marks." James rolled his eyes. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation," he said.

Dani noticed the three-pronged tracks and thought maybe a deer fell through.

Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, and zebras, along with Godzilla and Dr. Hazey.

By then, a few light snowflakes began to drift over them sideways. Thus, ended the nature lesson.

Bruce called for an about-face before the snow got serious. They were all to hightail it back to the Suburban, toot-sweet. Bruce, a native of Sand Point, Idaho, had some weird local sayings. He yelled at Dani on the ride back to Healing House to shut her pie hole. Not a phrase that Old Girl had ever heard in Portland. Score another for Youdaho.

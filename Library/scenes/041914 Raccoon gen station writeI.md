Nicole Hardy generation station

Dr. Hazey gets on a jihad about the raccoons after he drives the certification review team up to Healing House. The raccoons have strewn garbage from hell to breakfast.

["]{dir="rtl"}The newest addition to the Healing House family" --that[']{dir="rtl"}s how the middle-aged, big assed woman in charge had greeted him \-- had managed to stash a last Hail-Mary snort of cocaine under the insole of his running shoe. The two goons who had dragooned him away from his dorm room in Middlebury, Vermont, had snatched him at the end of a 72-hour drug and booze and sex and upsy-down-daisy-fest i.e. college life as he enjoyed it, and Joe, the wire, tense one with the tattoos had stripped Jason down to his socks and underwear but apparently hadn[']{dir="rtl"}t had the courage to stick his nose into Jason[']{dir="rtl"}s high tops, hence his blessed ability to snake a thin line of white lpowder on the bathroom counter, while the fat greeter thought he was taking a piss.

Jason was just coming down from the holiday in his system and he needed the white line to stay as is but he knew it was going to have to last him a long time until he could lie, cheat, steal or stab his way out of bum-fuck Idaho and the fucked up treatment program that his parents has chosen as a glorified babysitter for an old Jas.

He was torn between the short line of salt-white crystals that led to pleasured oblivion and the odd sight of a raccoon---was that what you called the creature? It was furry with a black mask and a striped busy tail and it was perched on a garbage can at eye level, unaccountably wearing a pink grapefruit like a beanie on its head.

Jas had only just huffed a tiny inhale and while the rest of the line beckoned to the emptiness in his veins, another part of his brain registered the pink rind tilted rakishly over one of the masked eyes so that for an instant, he thought the raccoon might be drunk or possibly stoned until it raised a pair of gray-black tiny hands and lifted the hat off its head and then buried his face in it. A long minute later, the hatless creature disappeared like a hallucination into a neighboring can.

Jason shook his head. Honked a nasal honk from his dried out nose and watched a spray of red mist dot the counter.

A feral hiss came through the cracked window from the direction of the garbage can, followed by a few loud thumps. A large gray-black head emerged from a bin, followed by a hissing, growling smaller raccoon who was baring its teeth at its partner as if size was nothing and only attitude mattered.

Fur began to fly and Jason, who[']{dir="rtl"}s heart rate was already elevated by that first blissful hit of snow ratcheted up a dozen notches as the fight outside the bathroom window got vicious. It was impossible to distinguish between big raccoon and small raccoon---they seemed somehow attached to each other by their teeth and claws and their cat-like screams made them sound like a couple of hos he[']{dir="rtl"}s witnessed cat fighting in Times Square over a john.

Jason bent to the counter the way a man dying of thirst drinks down a glass of water and hoovered up half the line. He paused, knowing it was the last of his stash, not wanting to think too hard about how the hell he was going to replace it in the middle of bum-fuck Idaho when he parents had locked him up for a minimum of sixty days at a psychiatric treatment facility.

A ,movement out of the small square window to his left stopped him before he bent over for the final schnozz.

His heart rate was already rocketing---it was good New Jersey shit, he reminded himself---but ta furry gray faced creature with a black mask was staring at him through the glass with a look of disapproval. What? He said. The creature had small pointy ears, a black tipped muzzle and in its tiny gray-black fingers, held up at Jason like a chalice, was a pink grapefruit. Its nose dipped down and a pink tongue darted out as it nibble daintily at the fruit looking so much like Jason[']{dir="rtl"}s mother, he did a double take.

For an instant Jason had the alien thought that perhaps it was a good thing he was in Idaho at a treatment center if he was going to be visited by a grapefruit eating mother who seemed to have turned herself into a raccoon. This thought was pushed away by another larger gray-andblack faced creature who attacked the same one from behind with a hiss.

A fierce scream like the cry of a ho in Times Square was was fighting tooth and claw for a john with another ho split the air. The grapefruit flew and then all Jason could see were teeth and swiping claws and a whirl of stripey tails.

A knock thunked on the bathroom door. Rap rap rap. ["]{dir="rtl"}Are you OK? Need help in there, Jason?" said Margaret, the woman who[']{dir="rtl"}d been assigned to show him around his ["]{dir="rtl"}new home."

["]{dir="rtl"}Uhhhh...." Feral hisses and yowls punctuated the quiet and Jason finally sucked it up and said, ["]{dir="rtl"}Is it me or is there a cat fight going on outside?"

He heard Margaret, the middle-aged woman who was showing him around, suck in a breath. ["]{dir="rtl"}Son of a bitch!" she cried. ["]{dir="rtl"}Those little motherfuckers!"

When Jason exited the bathroom, hyped to the gills, he looked all around the living room he[']{dir="rtl"}d been shown by Margaret, expecting her to be up in his grill about what the hell he[']{dir="rtl"}d been doing in the bathroom, but unaccountably, the big living area was empty. Quiet as a tomb.

He meandered over to the picture window. Off to the left, directly under the bathroom window he realized, a whole herd of raccoons were raiding the garbage bin.

The furball fight seemed to be over. The smaller raccoon had re-established hegemony over the grapefruit and the big-ass male with the fat ringed tail had its face embedded in a yogurt container.

Jason shakes off the feeling that his heart was going to carry off his body. In some part of his brain, he recognizes that raccoon are normal phenomena in Idaho yet they[']{dir="rtl"}re definitely abnormal on the upper East side of Manhattan amongst the investment bankers and seat holders on the New York Stock Exchange who are neighbors in his Mom[']{dir="rtl"}s co-op. Get me out of here, he[']{dir="rtl"}s thinking, at the exact moment that he sees Margaret with a big-ass gun taking aim at the rodents.

She looks like Annie Oakley in big ol[']{dir="rtl"} boots with a shot gun pulled up to her eye socket, one meaty hand squeezing the trigger.

It[']{dir="rtl"}s one thing to go from a cute masked critter wearing a grapefruit on its head to the same masked creature[']{dir="rtl"}s face flying apart from the force of a bullet in its eye.

Jason hears the pop. Sees the recoil punch Margaret in the shoulder and knock her back a step.

When he looks back to the raccoon family, they[']{dir="rtl"}ve vanished. No bandit masks. No striped bushy tails and busy gray hands. Just a fiesta of garbage strewn all over the snow-covered ground like a frat party gotten way out of hand.

He sinks to the couch, his chest banging in his throat. It[']{dir="rtl"}s not a heartbeat anymore, it[']{dir="rtl"}s a drum beat and it[']{dir="rtl"}s so loud, he feels it like a jackhammer between his ears.

When Margaret returns to the living room, she finds the new kid passed out on the couch. She can[']{dir="rtl"}t figure out what the hell set him off.

One minute she came in intending to explain the house rules and then she[']{dir="rtl"}d had to run out to chase off those fucking raccoon who[']{dir="rtl"}d once again gotten into the garbage before Hazey got back to the house with the recertification review team in tow. She[']{dir="rtl"}d do anything to avoid a shit fit. The kid had seemed fine, if hung over and a little strung out.

She watches him for a minute, expecting to see his chest rise and fall. Instead, his pulse is jumping in his throat like a live wire. His pulse rate is so high, she can barely count that high. She flips him up to sitting and she forces his head down between his knees, and holds him there while she speed-dials 9-1-1.

Jesus H Christ. Hazey doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t pay her enough to watch a kid barely out of high school go into heart failure.

Hazey[']{dir="rtl"}s jihad over the raccoons

For once, everybody was on point. Hazey[']{dir="rtl"}s orders falling into place like clock work. He[']{dir="rtl"}d warned the staff about making a good impression on the certification review board. ["]{dir="rtl"}You ,like your jobs, don[']{dir="rtl"}t you?" he[']{dir="rtl"}d said at staff meeting. ["]{dir="rtl"}The day we don[']{dir="rtl"}t get certification, your two week notice is official."

He was busy pointing out the record snowfall to the reviewers -- sno berms as high as one story roof tops, the Seattle natives used to damp and wet, bundled up like NOrthFace eskimos. When the sky went glacial blue and the weak winter sun spangled the white caps on Lake Couer D[']{dir="rtl"}Alene, the two women in back squealed appreciatively while the lone male, Dr. Edward Obadiah whistled a low, musical tone. ["]{dir="rtl"}God[']{dir="rtl"}s county," Hazey said to all around nods and he suppressed the urge to amend it to ["]{dir="rtl"}God-Forsaken County" as he noted the lumpy cumulus clouds that were lowering in promise of another snow dump.

Everything was going so well. Their first stop had been to the Couer D;Alene half way house where kids who[']{dir="rtl"}d passed on from lock-down out at Healing House to being able to attend college and live on their own with light supervision had gone swimmingly. A process group had been underway No one was acting out. Chocolate chip cookes baked in the kitchen so the house smelled like a facsimile of home-sweet home. Ever place set at the table for lunch, white placemats and blue China plates and matching silver.

Even Dr. Hazey who knew better thought the half-way house projected security and order that was whole cloth, not the patched-together tattered truth of Healing House where the kids were cracked and the holes in the wall where the dry wall had been patched over from being kicked in was still wet.

He almost didn[']{dir="rtl"}t make the drive out to Healing House. He could have held off that part of the tour till first thing in the morning when it was fully staffed. Everybody had their marching orders and it wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t have been perilously close to Cyanide Hour when both infants and psych patients tended to fall apart like time bombs in the late afternoon.

He knew right away something was amiss when an ambulance roared pas his SUV only a mile from Healing House. Nothing else, besides the town dump was out this way, and people usually buried things at the dump instead of trying to resurrect them. What the\-\--?

A hearse-length red ambulance was parked right in front of the Healing House doors. Hazey had to pulled up behind it, right next to the garbage bins.

Dr. Obadiah stepped out of the car in a dark gray flannel suit and Itlian loafers that were so soft and shiny, they looked like ballet slippers. Hazey clumped around the front of the SUV in big rubber packs, knowing the snow and ice was treacherous in soft-soled shoes. He was just in time to see Obadiah plant one shoe on a slick of salad slime.

You know that moment when time slows down and you can almost measure your own heart beats and the silences between them feel like little deaths? The Italian-loafered-foot snaking out. A gloved hand thrown up to clutch at nothingness. The infinitesimal glide of smooth leather sole on a thin sheen of ice. Obadiah sails backward like a comedian with the proverbial banana peel except it[']{dir="rtl"}s a clump of rotting lettuce he[']{dir="rtl"}s stepped on and Dr. Obadiah with four advanced degrees in psychiatry and public health and business administration as well as neurology goes down like a brick of heavy expectations.

The good doctor lies flat on his flannel suited back. His head haloed by a dark blotch of coffee grounds. One finger points to a pink grapefruit like Michelangelo[']{dir="rtl"}s portrait of God breaking life---or is it death---into Adam.

The door to Healing House bangs open. A gurney pushed by two medics trundles out with a white figure covered by a sheet. Margaret appears at the end of the parade. Seeing Hazey, she cries at the top of her lungs, ["]{dir="rtl"}We lost him!" She[']{dir="rtl"}s rushing toward him and Hazey can barely understand the rush of words. ["]{dir="rtl"}Iwentouttochasethe raccoons and he was already gonebythetime I got back!:"

Hazey has no idea who the kid is when the medic pulls back the white sheet. It[']{dir="rtl"}s a young man, a boy really, white faced and slightly acne-sotted early twenties male with a sparse bear and expensive orthodontured teeth revealed by the rictus of death."

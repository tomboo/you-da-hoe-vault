032015 Margaret's love hate relationship with her job

Margaret's love-hate relationship with her job was tilting perilously toward loathing.

She took the job of Day Supervisor at Inner Horizons two years ago because she loved kids. After raising three kids of her own, she thought that nothing teenagers could do would surprise her. Well, that was a big fat wrong.

The day Dr. Hazey hired her, he told her he needed someone unflappable and inventive who could roll with the punches.

Margaret had used her unflappability first thing in the morning when she transported a paper bag full of vomit out of Lydia's closet in the manner of someone carrying a bomb.

She'd used inventiveness with a plumber's snake by dragging a crew sock out of the powder room toilet. One of the boys kept jerking off in their red-striped crew socks, then flushing the evidence down the john. She made a mental note to count all the unmated socks in the boys' sock drawers so she could have a word with Mr. One Sock Hand Job about the limitations of modern plumbing.

She would have been better off if she'd rolled with the punches when she got kicked in the jaw during Danny's and Esty's catfight over whether Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift was a better singer. Now the bruise that pulsed under Margaret's chin bone felt like it needed a T-Bone from Lady Gaga's meat dress.

Margaret had never driven a car with leather seats and only 1900 miles on the odometer. She flew down I-90 in Dr. Hazey's champagne-colored Lexus SUV toward the West end of Lake Couer D'Alene. The rich people lived in view of the lake while poor people, like her and her husband Hank, lived behind them in the back hills with a view of the cows. Normally, she was happy and content on their ten acres with a garden and her flock of chuckle-headed Sex-Link chickens but by the time she worked her way past millions of dollars of prime real estate in Hazey's neighborhood---one house had honest-to-God pillars right out of Gone With the Wind---she was feeling kind of sick. Dr. Hazey's neighborhood made her humble dreams of health insurance and new brakes on their GM pick-up look like a failure of the imagination.

At Hazey's address on 1111 Wolf Howl Road, she found a contemporary concrete and steel house with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that swept out over the lake. Holy crap! Hazey's entire driveway was completely clean and dry---not a blot of snow in sight\--all the way up the front walkway to a massive red double door. The son-of-a-gun had some kind of heating system under the pavers! Margaret thought of the hour she'd spent shoveling her car out of her own driveway and she didn't know whether to laugh or throw up. Heated pavers! She'd never in her life envied people their second homes or their golf memberships or their new cars---well, not until she'd driven Hazey's Lexus---but a heated driveway? Be still her green heart. There were thing you just shouldn't know about your boss if you didn't want to make yourself sick. Was health insurance with a low deductible too much to ask?

She even liked her shitty, low-paying job. Well, she liked the kids anyway, even if she'd gotten a black-eye last week when she'd broken up a cat fight between Esty and Danny over whether Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift was a better singer.

The kids liked her too, because she didn't follow the Program's endless rules like a mindless slave. She knew enough about working with kids to look the other way sometimes. For example, she didn't hold with taking away their iPods and depriving them of music. Margaret couldn't live without music, so why should you ask something of the kids that you couldn't do yourself? She'd turned up the Lexus speakers to DefCon5 and sang along to Patsy Cline singing Crazy (it was in Hazey's CD player) though Margaret was more partial to reggae than country. "I'm crazy for cryin' and I'm crazy for tryin' and I'm crazy ...." she was humming as she turned the key to the kitchen door.

You didn't need a Ph.D. to cook a good nutritious meal. You needed fully functioning taste buds that weren't parched by a pack-a-day smoking habit. You needing an understanding of what kids will eat. Scalloped potatoes with non-fat milk and a miserly teaspoon of butter wasn't it by a long chalk.

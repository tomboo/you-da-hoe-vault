061716 Jed turns Ugly

When Lydia got to the pick-up spot next to the bench, Jed was waiting for her.

Jed was waiting for her in his GMC track when she walked down Garden street toward the pick-up bench. He idled along, just keeping up with her as she walked.

"Hey, bitch, you owe me," he called.

She could see the bench half a block ahead. A couple holding hands passed on the street side between them looking curiously at her. She felt like she was walking the truck tethered by an invisible leash. Should she turn around and catch up to them and leave Jed in his grumbling truck to another day?

She sped up her pace, though it didn't matter if she got to the bench any faster. No one else was there. And they wouldn't be there because she was ten minutes early.

"Get in," he said. "I want you to suck my dick."

A slight movement. Something shifted in the jump seat behind Jed and she realized he wasn't alone. A thin lanky man with sideburns stepped out of the still moving truck on the side closest to her and he had her in a bear hug, arms clapped around her and lifting her off her feet like an unwieldy package, before she could scream. She found herself face face down on the leather back seat, a knee in her back, and her ankles and feet were being zip-tied behind her.

"Now we're going to party, ain't we? Me and you and the cock tease. A three some at Signal Point."

Frankie was kneeing his weight in her back and squeezing her lungs so she couldn't breathe. She couldn't move with her face mashed into the upholstery and she felt him wrench her feet and ankles up to meet her wrists behind her. "Got it," Frankie said. "I got her hog tied, like you said."

"You wanna go first?" Jed said conversationally. "Or I could pump her in the back door while she suck your cock. "He reached back and got hold of Lydia's pompadour---the only place where her hair was long enough to pull---and yanked. "You're good at sucking dick, aren't you."

"Let me out!" she screamed, throwing her shoulders and trying to fling Frankie off her back. Jed handed him a roll of duct tape and continued talking, like she hadn't spoken. "I'll fuck her first and you can watch. You owe me."

She threw her head back and forth while Frankie tried to pull the tape out and fit it over her mouth. "Where are you taking me!" she cried.

"Know where the kids like to have keggers? Signal Point, past Post Falls?"

"Are you going to shut up?" Frankie said, dangling the tape in front of her.

She nodded, thinking no one would be able to hear her anyway. He got off her and slithered through the opening into the front seat and she realized Frankie O wasn't much bigger than she was. A boy, really. Or maybe just scrawny and underfed. He had a horrible case of acne with red angry welts.

Jed was fiddling with the radio while he drove, until he found a country station playing Shania Twain, "That Don't Impress Me Much." "We're going to teach a little girl a lesson." His voice was conversational, low and with an edge of malice.

"Why?"

"Don't you remember what Maggie Leary did to me?"

He threw her boots into the ravine in two different directions.

"It's not that far to Post Falls," Jed said. "Just head for the highway. Down hill all the way."

"I thought you liked me."

"That was before."

Before? She was swaying. Something was wrong with her balance and she couldn't hear very well unless her right ear was aimed in the direction he was speaking.

"It ain't that cold tonight," Jed said. "Besides you'll warm up if you start running."

She could barely walk. Everything below her waist was on fire and she was strangely listing, though she was telling herself to stand up straight.

The night was bright with a full moon. Her naked skin on her lower half looked white except for dark streaking on the inside of one leg.

Frankie was driving when they left in a cloud of exhaust. Jed was too tired and Frankie better not fuck up his truck any more than he already had or he'd whale the shit out of him. "Good Night Lucille" was playing on the radio and Jed was singing along.

Could she walk two miles without shoes in the dark? Her feet were numb as flocks and the wonky balance thing seemed to get worse as she tried to navigate downhill. She consciously aimed for the inner side of the roadway. A line of sharp black Ponderosas lined the upslope while the edge closest to the ravine fell off into thin air. She lurched along, trying to concentrate on keeping moving. She was still here, she told herself. She could see her hands in front of her. One yellow zip tie had been pulled tight on her wrist and it was cutting off the circulation on her fingers or aybe that was just the cold. Still here. Keep walking.

Jed made Frankie O strip her from the waist down but he left her in her socks. They tossed her Ferragamo boots and her jeans into the gully. The socks weren't a lot of protection from the cold but at least the snow was soft and the ruts from the truck hadn't frozen over. All she had to do was follow the tire tracks and keep walking. She could see her feet moving, one foot in front of her.

They'd left the zip ties in place so her arms were pulled tight behind her back. The biggest danger, she realized early on, was falling because she had nothing to help her pull herself up to her feet except years of ballet training in her core. Luckily, the first time she fell, she went down next to a rock and managed to get one shoulder on it for leverage until she could host herself straining and swaying back to standing.

After that, she kept her eyes trained on her feet to convince herself they were under here. It was either keep going or fall down for good.

She was done with that. The only one who was going to erase herself was herself. As long as she was upright, she knew she was still here.

They took her up to Signal Point, a place where the locals liked to do target practice, past Post Falls. Jed beat the shit out of her, knocking the shit out of her and punching and kicking her with his cowboy boots, then he and his friend, Frankie O---fucked her in a two way. Frankie couldn't keep his dick up and then Jed beat on him while she was face down, bare assed in the snow, and shivering.

After Frankie found some Ecstasy he kept in his jacket "for an emergency," they kind of lost focus and eventually, they left her where she'd fallen in the snow "to walk home."

Jed made Frankie drive because he was too wasted, and then, while the engine was running, Frankie O came back to her and got her to her feet. "Just keep going down," he said, his face pale in the moonlight. "You can't miss it. It's just a coupla miles."

"What's O for?" she mumbled, her jaw clicking. She wondered if it had been dislocated.

"What?"

"O. O for what?"

"O for awful," he said.

Nothing made sense that night. O for awful was the least of it. She'd gone down hill for a while, stumbling and listing along, until she finally figured out that he must have meant "offal." Was that supposed to be a joke? She remembered him saying a couple of times, "Keep walking. Don't lay down," like a parrot.

It was about this point that she realized all she had to do was lie still and survive. They were so high and drunk, sex with Jed too maybe two minutes and it took Frankie O less than a minute. She wondered if it was his first time because he spurted in his hand before he had it half way in.

When Jed starting waving a Bowie knife around to scare her and he talked about the best way to carve up her face, Frankie O produced a tab of Ecstasy from his pocket. "Hey, lookee here. Been saving this up for an emergency."

After that, they left her lying among the beer cans and bottles and broken glass.

"Let the bitch walk home," Jed told Frankie. "That'll teach her to fuck me me again." Then he took the boots that Frankie had dropped in the clearing and tossed them at her. She caught one in the chest but the other one sailed over her shoulder and disappeared in the ravine behind her. "Whoops," he said. "Good thing you still got your socks."

The sound of the truck grinding into gear started up and the truck moved a little ways downhill. She was swaying at the edge of the slope, trying to pick out the lost boot in the shadows, and wondering if she had the strength to climb down and find it. Frankie O came loping back into the clearing. He shoved a pair of battered work boots at her and said, "Put these on. They'll get you to I-90."

She heard the truck grumble into life and listened to it groan in low gear down the mountain for a long time. The faint sigh of wind in the trees became her only companion.

The boots were a lot bigger than her feet, battered and paint-spattered. They slopped and galumphed as she tried to walk in them and eventually, she learned to kick her toe forward and let the heel float free in a kind of cross-country skating gait.

The coat smelled like Frankie. A combination of motor oil and sweat that was surprisingly comforting because at least it smelled human. Frankie O hadn't joined in Jed's punch fest. He'd hovered in the background, looking worried and slightly scared himself. He'd distracted Jed with a new beer when he started kicking her. And when the Bowie knife came out and Jed wanted to carve his initials in her face, Frankie magically found a tab of Ecstasy that he'd "been saving for an emergency." After that Jed was so drunk and high, she just had to stay out of the way of the bullets they took turns shooting at the beer cans they lined up on the cast-off refrigerator.

She wasn't sure when Frankie O turned from foe to friend. He was the only reason she was still alive. He got Jed to give him the rifle in exchange for a tab of Ecstasy he'd "been saving for an emergency". He plied him with beer after beer in some kind of drinking game that involved them slapping at each other's hands. Every time Jed lost, he had to drink and by then the Ecstasy must have kicked in because he was staring up at the stars and babbling about pin wheels and sky scrapers by the time Frankie poured him into the cab.

They had a big argument before they took off about whether to take her or leave her behind. that Lydia only caught snatches of it. Jed wanted to leave her on the mountain "so the bitch could learn what cold was" and Frankie O tried to convince him that they'd scared and fucked with her enough. Jed got out and staggered around the clearing until he found the boots they'd yanked off of her when they dragged her pants off her. He was screaming about how Margaret had slapped the shit out of him and in the middle of a long, incomprehensible tirade, Jed tossed them into the ravine.

Lydia was already freezing. She'd been standing or kneeling pantless and shoeless in the snow and she couldn't feel her feet.

She was appalled when they drove off. Frankie was in the driver's seat and Jed was hanging out the passenger window, hooting and waving and shouting. "Have a good time," he hollered" and fuck all the coyotes you want!"

They went about 100 yards before the truck ground to a halt. Frankie's door flew open and he came around the back of the pick-up calling to Jed that he had to take a piss. Instead, he scrabbled around in the truck bed and then loped back to her and tossed her a pair of large, paint-spattered boots. He pulled her to her feet where she swayed and staggered, trying to find her balance. "Don't lie down. You gotta walk. Keep walking downhill and somebody'll pick you up on I-90."

He was looking at her like he wanted to say something more. Finally, he shrugged out of his brown down jacket and shoved it at her. "You'll be safer here than with us," he said.

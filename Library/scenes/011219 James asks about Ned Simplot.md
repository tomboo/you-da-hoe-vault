011219 James asks about Ned Simplot

"Who was that guy?" James asked Margaret when Lydia went off to pee.

"What guy?"

"The one you coldcocked with your purse."

Margaret waved her hand like she was brushing off a fly. "Oh, he's a Simplot, one of the shoestring ones. Far away from the money."

Simplot. Pimp-a lot. James, who considered himself to be from money, too, persisted. "What was his name again?"

"Ned Simplot."

"How do you know him?"

"I don't. I know his mother, Nora. I went to school with her a hundred years ago."

Lydia came back in and then it was James's turn to pull the faucet with the famous pipe wrench. When James torqued on the arm, he could hear its distant thwup sound against the cowboy's shoulder bone. He reefed again. The recalcitrant pipe gave way with a satisfying groan. James wondered if Margaret had broken any bones on the cowboy. The way he went to his knees like a sack of cement was spectacular.

While his hands were busy, his mind played at the memory of the cowboy and how he'd picked up the bat with one end flattened by the van. He couldn't seem to hang on to the cowboy's name and he didn't want to ask Margaret again but he could see the guy's expression like the event was still happening. Sheer malevolence. Pimplot. No, Dimlot? Something 'plot' was smoking mad. If he'd been a cartoon character, steam would have been coming out of his ears.

James forgot the guy's name as soon as Margaret said it. That happened to him a lot. It was like his own identify was so fluid and unfixed, he had no ability to fix any one else's. It pissed him off. He wanted to remember the cowboy's name. That expression on his face creeped him out. The guy had been starting at the bat which was flattened at one end -- no Louisville slugging for it -- then the cowboy had raised it like a crowbar and shook it at them as they drove off. The thought made him shiver, though it was warm in the bathroom where they were working. Maybe it wouldn't hit a ball but it would certainly bust a melon.

James looked up in the mirror at his own broad forehead. Nordic coloring, blond hair, blue always. He always thought he looked like some caricature of whiteness especially if he chanced to see himself in a mirror in the locker room with one of the black guys he played with. He was long limbed, broad shouldered. Wheat colored hair hung to his shoulders. Mr. All American. But he wasn't seeing Captain America at that moment. He was seeing the Louisville Slugger flattened on one end, held up by the cowboy like a crowbar.

They were always calling him Whitey; they called themselves Nigger this and Nigger that but James wasn't about to call them Nigger anything. The unwritten rule where race trumped friendship, particularly with a whitey.

If he called Tyrell a monkey, Tyrell would have flattened his whitey friend into a greasy spot. No wonder Rachel raised an eyebrow at him at dinner. Jesus. Where was his brain when his asshole decided to speak?

"Hey Margaret," he said. "Better hang on to the pipe wrench for a while."

"For what?" she asked. "The faucets are fixed."

"Something else might break around here," he said. "You never know."

"It was a stroke of luck I had it with me, wasn't it?" She was referring to the cowboy. That satisfying thunk the pipe wrench made when it connected with his shoulder.

"Diplot won't forget it," James said.

""Jesus, it's Simplot," she said. "What is it with you kids? Are you all deaf?"

"Jed, Ned," Lydia interjected unexpectedly. "What's the difference? The guys a dead beat."

"He's dangerous," Margaret said, turning the faucet on and letting the water run. Thumbs up when she turned it off. No dripping.

"Not as dangerous as you," Lydia said.

"Stay away from him anyway," Margaret said.

Apology?

"It was uncool," James said to Rachel.

"It wasn't uncool. It was racist," was her answer.

His heart went to his toes. It was worse than he'd imagined. She hadn't just heard him. She'd judged him and found him wanting.

"Do you think I'm a monkey?" she asked.

"No."

"I am. So are you. We're all descended from apes."

But I'm the only one stupid enough to act like one, he thought. "What's your point?"

"You fucked up. How are you going to make it right?"

"To you? Or to Reza?"

Her eyes were serious. No letting him off the hook. "To Reza, you idiot. I'm not the one you insulted."

Yes, but you're the only one I care about, he suddenly realized.

"I'll apologize."

"It would help if you'd mean it."

Fucking busted.

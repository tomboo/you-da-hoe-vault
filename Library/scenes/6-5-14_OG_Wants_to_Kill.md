OG wants to kill

She\'d been asked about a hundred times why she wanted to kill herself. If she\'d been able to answer, she would have done it already!

Her standard answer was a shrug. It wasn\'t some rational \"if A, then B\" equation. It was just an is, like the sun in the sky, the on switch in a room, the fact that water was wet.

She remembered the first time it had seemed like an inevitability. She\'d been up in a live oak tree in the backyard of the [\_\_\_]{.underline}villa house before Mom and Dad were killed by a geriatric blind guy who shouldn't have been driving.

She\'d managed to outstrip all the neighbor kids and monkey climbed up to the highest branches. Everybody was yelling at her to come down--\"it\'s too high\"\"you\'ll break your neck\"-- and their shouts of warning seemed to draw her further and further out on a branch she could feel bending underneath her weight. When she\'d shimmied as far as she could go she\'d looked far down at a green patch of lawn that beckoned as soft as a green pillow. *Jump*, the grass seemed to be calling. *Jump now* and she\'d imagined the green shoots reaching up to her like living fingers that would brush her tangled hair and calm her to sleep.

The weird part of the memory was not having the foggiest idea how she got down or even why she got down. She only remembered the siren song of simplicity, \"Jump! Jump now.\"

Once Mom and Dad were gone, only the compulsion remained and then it wasn\'t only saying \"Jump!, it was saying, pull! push! fall! Throw! Cannonball! wherever there was ledge more than five feet high or anything jagged on which to land.

Hazey hadn\'t asked her why she wanted to kill herself. One reason she kind of liked the old fart. He told her there was no why for that kind of thing, it was just a chemical imbalance that they needed to reset. In her rare moments of hatefulness, she thought if they reset the balance maybe she wouldn\'t be up in the damn tree.

If that were true, why was she surround by 2 and 3 hundred feet Ponderosa pines had reached all the way to heaven? She asked . Idaho seems as logical a place to die as Chicago or Indiana when Peggy and David lived.

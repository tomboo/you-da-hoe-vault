> REZA WAS FUCKING OFF LIKE JAMES AND PUTTING OFF WRITING HIS IMPACT LETTER TOO. All Reza wanted to do was talk about watching carbuncle popping on YouTube. It was the thing he missed most about the technology they'd taken away.
>
> "What's a carbuncle?" James asked.
>
> "A boil with multiple heads."
>
> When James didn't seem to be able to visualize this, Reza took it upon himself to draw a picture of boil anatomy learned from his viral YouTube hero, Dr. Pushwill. Apparently, specialization in large growth removal was a thing.
>
> "Pushwill? You're making that up."
>
> "Bushmill." Reza stressed the 'mill' syllable but then he seemed to like 'Pushwill' better and decided to earn a four on the Daily Quadrant by writing a thank you letter to Dr. Pushwill for his educational services and contribution to higher learning.
>
> James was thinking darkly about his own benighted letter of accountability, wishing he could wax on and loosen the pressure of evil-smelling keratin and dead cells that were building up to an explosive force.
>
> "I'll congratulate him on how he always knows how to stay out of the way! He starts to shove on the skin around the pus, man, and he has an unerring sense for when it's going to blow." Then Reza went off on seeing Dr. Pushwill spray his assistant JeanMarie in the neck. "She screamed and said she'd never get the stink out! Doc got her to laugh when he said any boil could be a lethal weapon if they weren't so hard to aim."
>
> James felt sick to his stomach. He kept staring at the white paper he couldn't bear to write on. Would it hurt less if he let the truth blow? Or would the stink follow him around forever?
>
> "Have you ever smelled a carbuncle?" he asked, idly.
>
> Of course Reza had.
>
> His father, some high exec at Goldman Sachs, developed one on his hairy back. Reza's mother, a wanna-be nurse, operated on it on the kitchen table.
>
> Ewww. James wondered how they could bear to eat on the table afterwards.
>
> "Hey, do you know what queef is?" Reza, king of the non sequitur, asked.
>
> "Something you shoot up or ingest?"
>
> "It means "expulsion of air through the vagina."
>
> "A vagina fart? That's disgusting!"
>
> "I don't think they smell."
>
> "Really?"\
> "They squeak."
>
> James, was ready to change the subject so he tried a non sequitur of his own. "English people eat something called bubble and squeak,"
>
> But does it come from the vagina, Reza wanted to know.
>
> Then like a homing pigeon, Reza was back to the smell of his father's carbuncle. "Pure evil," he said, "like something died in there and rotted while the bastard carried it around in him for years."
>
> This was not helping James get his accountability letter down on paper. Reza had given up on his letter too He said his dad already told him he didn't want to hear any excuses. "What else is there?"
>
> James told Reza to take a hike so he could get some work done.
>
> When Reza finally left to bug Margaret, James stared out the window. The pressure was building inside him but all he could do was stuff it down in a warm dank place and let it simmer.
>
> He hoped he had Dr. Pushmill's luck when it blew.

042717 OG Watches Moose Drown draft

NINE

OLD GIRL HEARD THE BOOMING BEFORE she saw it. A tinkling sound like breaking glass. Thrashing and crashing, accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl raced ahead down the blue-shadowed trail that descended to a lake, followed by James who put on speed coming up on her like a sprinter. A thunderous crack. Then came an odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Old Girl had ever heard.

By the time she got to the lake, the moose was already tiring. Cloven hoof prints lead to a jagged-edged dark pool a hundred yards from the lakeshore. A moose floundered in roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. The moose would lunge forward. Its massive wither heaved up onto the shelf and then the ice would break off with its weight. Every time it managed to get up, another ledge of ice would shear off. The black water was dotted with snow clumps that shuddered and bobbed when the creature fell back into the black water and started swimming in circles.

"Holy shit!" James' voice was awestruck.

"What can we do?" Rachel's usually low voice broke high and squeaky. Even in Old Girl's astonishment at the sight of the struggling moose, she registered the fracture. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind as the moose made another attempt to lunge forward. Its huge antlers raked the snow and its rolling eyes started in terror when it fell.

"Get a stick!" Old Girl clawed at a clump of downed alder trapped in the ice at the shore. She got both hands on a branch and started jumping on it to try to break it out of the ice.

"What good is that? What's it going to hold on with?" James cried.

"Maybe we can get a branch under it. Lever it up somehow." Old Girl beckoned to Rachel and Rachel started jumping with her until the branch splintered and broke.

Even with James and Rachel stomping with her on a stand of alder scrub they couldn't break off a sturdy enough tree to hold its weight. Without an axe or a saw, the green trees defeated them. They had a surprisingly robust will to survive to their own. Was that the way to make it through this life? Put down strong enough roots to survive any storm?

Old Girl hauled a big ass branch toward the hole in the ice but before she got ten steps out on the ice, she felt an ominous crack underfoot. She hesitated. The crack zipped behind and in front of her and the ice she was standing on started to sink. An inch of water started to flow towards her from the shoreline. In seconds, her boot toes were submerged and she felt a spring and wobble underneath her as if the ice was a moving deck.

James, who was a tree length behind her, immediately dropped to his belly. \"Get down!\" he yelled. \"Spread out your weight."

His tone was so loud, so strident, Old Girl obeyed instantly. She felt the spongy ice seem to bounce and flex when her weight spread out enough to allow it to give without breaking.

The tree she\'d thrown out in front of her was sliding toward the dark water which was flowing on top of the ice toward the hole where the moose was swimming.

\"Shimmy backwards,\" James ordered.

Rachel and Old Girl were holding the ice-laden branch in their bare hands when the elk made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back into heaving water chocked with floating ice. As they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its shoulders and withers sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of its antlers lit by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above the blue-black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly under, the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-clotted hole.

My God, Rachel thought. Oh my God.

By the time the rest of the group joined them on the shoreline, the water had stopped spinning and the ice blocks barely shivered. Josh pointed to the jagged hole in the ice and said, "Looks like something fell through. Got any guesses what?"

Rachel opened her mouth to tell them about the moose but Old Girl instantly stepped sideways, and nearly knocked her off her snowshoes. What the\--?

James was busy inspecting a clump of withered aspen saplings as if they had some kind of blight.

"Jesus, watch where you're going." Rachel yanked her snowshoe out from under Old Girl's netting and kept her mouth shut, as Old Girl intended.

Reza said a grizzly fell in. "Look. You can see its claw marks."

James said, "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else saw the cloven tracks and thought a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, Godzilla and Dr. Hazey, the head of Inner Horizons. "He forgot to look where he was going," said Danny.

A gust of wind and a drift of snowflakes ended the nature lesson. Josh said they had to turn back to the trailhead before the snow got serious.

When James turned away from the shoreline and took up a position right behind her on the trail, as if he wanted to watch over her, Rachel's heart gave a tiny lurch. She remembered James squeezing her hand during her seizure. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Or was there a God and the black pants she always wore like a uniform had saved her like she hoped?

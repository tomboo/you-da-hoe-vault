071017 OG reacts to moose death

OG frantically yanked and heaved at a sapling that was too green to break. She glanced behind her to keep an eye on the moose,but it was gone.

She blinked. Turgid water circled and whorled in silence. An ice chunk bobbed, righted itself, shivered in a precarious upright position. Beyond the jagged black hole, whiteness spread to a distant blue shore.

It\'s gone. The thought reverberated in the silence. Did it save itself?

Rachel and James stilled at the same moment. Old Girl got the sense that they were as dumbfounded by the sudden emptiness as she was.

\"Where\--?\"

\"What the\--?\"

They spoke and stopped leading as if language was no longer a dependable bridge to make sense of what was no longer there. Old Girl felt an intense need to make sure that she had actually seen what her eyes had told her. A moose fell through the ice, right?

The branch in Rachel\'s hand dropped into the snow with a soft plop. \"It sank,\" she said. \"I saw it go under.\"

At least Rachel has witnessed its last living moments, Old Girl thought bitterly. She herself had been so intent on breaking off the sapling, she\'d missed the moment the waters closed over its head.

Her blood pulsed and she felt an electric frizz of adrenalin. She\'d never felt more alive than in the instant she imagined how the moose\'s thousand pound bulk was even now slowly sinking deeper into darkness. A great weight was pressing it down. Cold and darkness were swallowing the creature whole as it drifted under the barrier of ice that wouldn\'t melt until summer .

Mammoth regret overwhelmed her. Old Girl felt a terrible urge to turn the clock back. She imagined hear the blowing of the creature\'s snorts. Imagined seeing its wild rolling eyes and regal antlers. Imagined it heaving its furry bulk up onto thicker ice, gaining purchase and stumbling for the far shore in a cascade of water. Was it too much to hope it would disappear into the forest that stretched as far as Canada and beyond.

It seemed absolutely incomprehensible that the creature was even now sinking deeper into thickening darkness below the ice. Cold would be deepening as the pressure rose around its heart. Silence would grow profound, until it lost even the memory of making sound at the bottom.

As much as she had imagined her own death, she knew that she was in the presence of something ineffable. Something so far beyond her understanding or her ability to control it, she felt small and deeply alone. Which is why, when Rachel stumbled toward her, and James lurched toward Rachel, she reached for them both as they reached for her. Herd animals. Three young people clung to each other and listened to the sound of their own and each other\'s breathe. Old Girl felt James pat her on the Back, felt the squeeze of Rachel\'s arm around her waist, and pressed both arms around their shoulders while she buried her nose in the warmth at Rachel\'s neck..

Closeness was all they had, so they took it.

For all her own efforts to kill herself, Old Girl herself had never been in the presence of death. She\'d felt its aftermath when her family was erased, but not its cold breath.

The slow circling of the ice chunks were the only sign that a living creature had swum there. The hole was black and like an open mouth. A low soughing in the alders sounded like a low moan..

Had something horrible and dark emerged from the black water and swallowed the moose in its maw?

Her eyes ricocheted to the nearest living things to reassure herself that what she witnessed had really existed. Rachel\'s eyes were wide with astonishment. James looked shell-shocked, faintly stunned.

\"What happened?\" he said.

\"It gave up,\" Rachel said. \"I saw it go under.\"

Then Rachel sturned towards Old Girl and James stumbled towards Rachel and she couldn\'t stop herself from reacheaching both arms out to these people she barely knew. She , pressed her nose into Rachel\'s warm and faintly damp neck while feeling the weight of James \'s arm around her shoulder while her own arm circled their waists. The closeness wasn\'t enough but it was all they had and they took it.

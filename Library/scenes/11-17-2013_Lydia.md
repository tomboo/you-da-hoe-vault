Lydia

What is Lydia\'s arc? She starts out sex addicted and bulimic -- continually trying to fill herself up by any means possible. James dumps her because she\'s an un-fillable hole. She tries to fill herself up with food but has to empty herself out to fit her size 2 jeans. She tries to use sex to connect with the Mormon kid but he doesn\'t want her body either. He wants her companionship, he wants a listening ear, he wants to hear her opinion and to be with her and drink coffee and eat a PB&J sandwich with her but she\'s so [\_\_\_]{.underline} about food, she\'s surprised to feel that it makes her full and eating with someone is satisfying. She needs to go from empty to full. She\'s got all the money in the world, a tiny beautiful body, a Jewish heritage with no religious feeling. The homeless kid has nothing; no family, no money, no home and moral authority and a sense of self that keeps him centered and whole. She\'s missing something and the big boned red haired bearded kid fills in her gap.

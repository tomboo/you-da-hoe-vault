01202025 Lydia Last Thoughts When She Gives Up

Lydia stumbles and it just seems easier --- so much less effort --- to sink, rather than rise.

She'd been weaving along. If someone was hovering above her --- a cougar, say, who traced her footsteps and then climbed a tree and took in the way they veered all over the road like she was drunk. Punch drunk, that was it. She was constantly listing town the downward slope and having to correct toward the middle so she didn't pitch over into the ravine.

If you were a cougar following her smell, you would have laid on a branch above her and watched her sway as she tried to stand upright. Some process unknown but good for the cougar causes the prey to sink down and rest, then crawl slowly on all fours like the cougar's wobbly kits, to the base of lodgepole pine anchored in the snow bank. Snow is built up around the narrow trunk. A deep well looks like a protected place for the mop of clothes rich with blood to settle in for the long winter's night.

Lydia is able to rest her aching back against the bark. The fire in her kidneys has steadily worsened but now it is keeping her warm like a fire. She doesn't feel the cold seeping in with the blue-dark shadows that look as plush as violets in the well where the moon rays can't reach.

She's seeing her botany notebook. A page where there's a drawing of some kind of flower, not violets, oh yes, glacier lilies that she remembers as the best drawing she'd ever done. She remembers sitting in the icy snow as her butt goes numb to work on the intricate strokes. How hard she worked to get the brilliant sunny yellow of the stamen to contrast with the dark purple shadows un the snow pack as it reached for the sun. Afterwards, she won't be able to stand with the paralysis of pins and needles and an out-of-body numbness that came over her when she was so focused and happy trying to limn the shape of the lily petals climbing through blue ice to yellow warm light. She thought about trying to stand on those pins and needles which long ago sent her stumbling to the ground and thinks clearly and logically, I'll just sleep here for a little while the lilies are drawing upwards to the rising sun.

Before she closes her eyes, she look above her to the road she'd been walking. It was only a few feet above her now that she's in the haven of the well. Her last stumble downward made the distance seem like the peak of Mt. Rainier.

The thought of Mt. Rainier brings her to the peak on the wings of her imagination. She's sitting atop a deep snow package feeling her legs and butt go number as she tries and tries to capture the sun-bright yellow the glacier lily's stamen as the petals climb out of snow melt.. She's darkened the violet shadow underneath the blue-pale snow and the darkening brightens the fingers of the white petals as they try to get warm against all the blue frigid snow

Briefly warm, briefly happy in that moment, she's feeling the heat in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s gaze as her first Leo pronounces the glacier lily as her best watercolor ever. Lydia settles in to sleep knowing that bone deep cold will be replaced by sun.

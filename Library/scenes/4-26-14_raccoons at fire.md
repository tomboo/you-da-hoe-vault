No title

Two things to figure out.

Need to write the raccoon vision the night of the fire like the moose /magical realism scene. Need a metaphor for the otherworldly flower faces against the black sky. Spots of color. Ragged edged and splotchy with feral masked faces strain out. It\'s an odd otherworldly sight that is so strange and unexpected the crowd murmurs in astonished wonder.

There\'s a logical explanation but

The sight was illogical and strange and wonderment seemed to be catching as it hopped from the stranded kids in their mismatched boots and blankets, to the firemen in their neon-striped coats that matched the neon glow of the raccoons.

\"So Margaret\'s aim was better than she thought,\" was Rachel\'s conclusion. The raccoons were splattered with paint spray where the canisters had exploded against their bellies and haunches. On one paint ran from its shoulder down its forearm to a tiny, almost human starfish of a hand.

I\'d like to write and tell [song]{.underline} story at the \_\_ on Thursday.

The Heist and put Your Hands Up and how the song lyrics, \"This is the moment. We\'ll fight till it\'s over,\"

comes back in a revolving charms until the moment the real \"This is the moment\" when Carla\'s fight was finally over and the music died out, and it\'s really the end.

Seems like I should parse the story into beginning, middle and end and get that locked. Maybe there are 5 movements--one for each minute-- when would be a way to make the music\'s return work as the structure that holds the story together.

I wonder if I could do a [Machlemore]{.underline} imitation: Literally memorize the rap of \" uh huh oka what it is, what it isn\'t.\" I like the idea of how Put Your Hands Up becomes the spine of the story of her death and how anytime [Macklemore\'s]{.underline} voice comes on the radio or I hear it playing on someone\'s\' computer, the fight till it\'s over brings Carla\'s death back that she dies over and over and it\'s the fight not the actual death that keeps her alive, no matter how many minutes, hours, days, months and soon a year since she\'s been gone.

The story is a meditation on death and memory and fighting to stay in the moment fight for it not to be over which is why she is forever fighting and never truly dead.

The story starts with climbing into the driver\'s seat of Carla\'s red Mazda 03. I\'m in the dim basement of Swedish Medical Center in a black leather interior fumbling around to find the lights and the ignition and the gear shift because it's a stick shift and I have to remember to press the clutch into neutral and not grind into an unfamiliar reverse when a \_\_bodied voice rocks the car with \"uh-haa okay what it is what it isn\'t\" like a man is in the dark enclosed space with me.

It\'s Oct 8, 2013. Carla, ,dying sister, is upstairs in 12E on\_\_ ward of Swedish Hospital, fighting for her life and I\'ve been with her since early morning when Dr. Kaplan admitted her with her elephant-sized legs and her \_\_ kidneys that can\'t clear the fluid that's inexorably building like a balloon about to burst.

I\'m 61, I\'ve heard the name [Macklemore]{.underline} but I'm not exactly his prime demographic--not into rap, not into hip-hop, old enough to know and [literary]{.underline} enough to know that Tupac is taught at Harvard but \_\_ that I don\'t know what it means when [Macklemore]{.underline} sings, \_\_\_ raised me.

012719 OG on Estie arrival prior to the fork stabbing

The weather outside wasn't as bad as the weather inside. Cooped up, without even being allowed to walk around the block, sick of each other, sick of themselves, disgusted with the staff, mad about the breakfast of burned oatmeal and later, the unidentifiable stew served at lunch, they all turned on each other in various ways.

By noon, everyone except OG --James, Reza, Dani, Lydia, Paul, Ian, Becca, even Rachel---had been oned out. OG, who had a paper on Animal Farm due the next day, kept her head down and worked. It was the only defense against getting it whacked off by the flying barbs.

Around 4 PM, Josh came stomping in to the living room, shedding snow like a yeti. He had four-wheel drive so he'd taken pity on Estie and picked her up from Stable. She'd been there a week since the fist fight with Axel before Lydia got him fired.

Darlene and Gretchen had to go out with Josh to his SUV and half carry-half-drag Estie into the living room. She was half-catatonic, looped to the eyeballs with thorazine, her head nodding, eyes closed as they motored her in.

Everyone in the living room had long ago called their spots. Dani had a shit fit when they laid Estie out on "her" couch. That was the problem with getting oned out. There was no zero at Inner Horizons so what else were they going to do to you except take away your dessert. Big whoop: there usually wasn't any, except for tonight because Margaret had made pies to celebrate Dani's last day.

OG had been sitting on the floor most of the day. Her papers were spread around her so she could reorder them as she made random points in her essay. She leaned up against the side of the couch and wrote when an idea struck her. She was ostensibly working on a new allegory of Animal Farm about how the Rohingas in Myanmar were the allegorical chickens and the repressive military regime was the dog pack but really, she was thinking about who was who at Healing House.

She'd picked \_\_\_\_ as the pig and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was the guard dog in the Healing House pecking order. It was more entertaining than trying to build an allergy for the situation in Myanmar whom she couldn't find on a map and couldn't look up because the only computer she had access to was at the library snowed in at NICC.

Estie smelled funky from her half-lying half-sitting position on the couch near her. Estie was off-gassing chloraquine. It was a green smell, slightly grassy and it would come out of her pores for days as the drug wore off. They'd given it to OG at Stable and she'd smelled it on herself when she was coming out of the worst confusion and sleepiness of her life. Estie, above her and slightly to the side, was snoring, a half sawing, half snorting sound. OG hoped she'd keep sleeping forever because when she woke up, she'd regret it.

There was a fight at breakfast over the oatmeal which was burned black on the bottom. Nobody would eat it and everybody got oned in the quadrant of "living by the rules."

A fight broke out over the couches. Dani and Reza called the plaid couch but James and Rachel got there first and that became Couch-pocolypse until Darlene gave all four of them ones for "disrespecting one's peers."

There was an argument over the Parcheesi board (Paul v. Reza); a fight over who got to sit next to James at lunch (Rachel v. Lydia); a fight over what unidentifiable meat was in the stew (Paul v. Dani); and when Paul discovered that some asshole removed the Queen from the chess set, he broke it over his knee and threw it in the fireplace.

OG kept her head down, which wasn't too hard since she was sitting on the floor, and had to fight off sleep in order to get her stupid paper on Animal Farm done.

She was supposed to come up with a new allegory from the current news that matched the one in Russia that Orwell had based his story on. Her plan when she got the assignment was to go to the library to look up the situation in Myanmar with the Rohingas and the Myanmar military but because of the snow dump, she had no access to NICC, much less the library. How the hell was she going to write about whatever was happening in the real world when she was locked out of it?

Usually, with the distractions of Group and individual therapy and CBT sessions and DBT workshops and NICC classwork for people beyond intensive, they could all operate like a pinball machine and bounce off each other without sticking. Today it was like every time one of the balls careered into each other, they magnetized and stuck together and then World War III broke out.

It was one big mad.

Big Paul was mad at everybody because somebody stole the queen from the chess set. In retaliation, he broke the Parcheesi board in half over Reza's head, and they had to be separated.

James got mad at Reza for getting catsup on his letter jacket which he'd borrowed without asking. Dani was made at Inger for siding with Lydia over which Kardashian was hotter; Inger really hated Lydia and now she was stuck sharing the flowered couch with her and they started sniping at each other and got sent to opposite sides of the room. Rachel was mad at OG for not wanting to be BFFs; Reza was mad at Lydia for calling him Apu; James told Reza not be such a crybaby; and then even Darlene and Gretchen got into it because Darlene wouldn't help Gretchen in the kitchen since Charlene couldn't drive into work because her tires were bald. Darlene said she wasn't paid enough to do kitchen work and Gretchen accused her of getting up on her high horse, because she had a Ph.d and Gretchen only had a Masters.

You know that feeling of cluster when the cluster is the fuck? That was OG's day in a nutshell.

OG tried to concentrate on her Animal Farm paper for English lit but couldn't think of anything to write about. She was supposed to create a new allegory based on Animal Farm from the current news. She thought she'd be writing about the Rohingas fight against the Myanmar military regime, something her professor had suggested, but her only access to a computer was at the NICC library, 17 miles away and stuck in three feet of snow. Her knowledge and interest in the Rohingas wouldn't fill a tea cup anyway, so she was mad at herself for putting off the research until the day before the paper was due. Now what? Some allegory when the only thing to allegorize were the people around her.

Immediately, when that thought occurred to her, she saw Maragaret as Horse. When Margaret smiled with her long teeth, she looked slightly horse and her big ass laugh was loud as a neigh. Hazy was easy -- he was the Tsarist regime: rich as hell and totally out of touch with the workers. He needed to be deposed, seriously. So that meant Grinchen was Napoleon the Pig---the one who used the propaganda machine to say black was white. "We don't want to drink the milk and eat the apples. We only eat them because we have to." Grinchen said basically the same thing about the bulk spinach and gristly meat. A-one! Nothing but the best. And so nutritious.

Maybe OG could get Margaret to write her a note about being stuck in treatment with no access to a computer to get an extension on her paper. That would bolster the argument for making an Animal Farm allegory about her peers. Even OG thought this was unlikely to pass muster but what could she do stuck miles away from town in the middle of a blizzard. Hunker down and avoid the missles she could hear flying around her like V-bombs without the whistles.

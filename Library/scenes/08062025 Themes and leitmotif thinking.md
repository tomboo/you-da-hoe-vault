08062025 Themes and leitmotif thinking

Stuckness versus movement is a major theme. From the get go, I need to set the claustrophobic everybybody-on-top-of-everybody-else state that these characters are trapped in.

This should relate to the weather in the opening. The constantly falling snow, the curtains of gray that occlude the light and fall monotonously, unchangingly, all day until people want to stab someone just for the diversion.

The weather out of town to Two Mouth lake starts out gray and cloud covered but the farther out in the wilderness they go, the wider the sky gets and bluer and they finally see the sun.

It reminds me of Jane Eyre's opening, "There was no possibility of a walk that day." All my characters are stuck in purdah until they figure out how to move on.

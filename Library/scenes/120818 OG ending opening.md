120818 OG ending opening

When Old Girl realized Process Group was about saving her life, she stopped day dreaming about suicide. Fuckity fuck fucking no! Not this torture to add to the rest of her torment today. Save me.

Usually she sat impervious and numb to the flayed feelings and nauseating views of the open sores and pulsing hearts of her peers in the surgical evisceration they called Process Group. Inner Horizon's idea of "helping" you to get well was to go in and rip out your organs and hold them up to your peers without benefit of anesthesia. That you had to supply yourself.

She was actually pretty good at it; OG had built up a tremendous oversupply of numbness to cope with her incarceration at the "worst run psychiatric treatment program in the country" -- a direct quote from Darlene, the head Therapist who was running today's group. Darlene was looking for another job. She'd confided her assessment to a colleague she was pumping for job leads when OG had been sitting outside her office waiting for her therapy session with Dr. Hazey, the founder of the program. Darlene was in the act of shutting her door which was right next to Dr. Hazey -- "power had its privileges," she liked to say---while the Good Doctor was once again late.

She'd overheard this nugget as Darlene, who was leading today's group, was in the act of shutting her office door. It was one away from the founders office and it was obvious why she didn't want Dr. Hazey to hear himself described a few seconds later as " the least organized, most criminally lazy man in the world." My hero. My therapist.

The pain was so great, she just wanted to get away from it. Sometimes she imagined herself in the upper story of a burning building with flames roaring up the stairs, heat singing her back as she stared out an open window. She wasn't thinking about the splat; she was thinking only of flight.

As the months after their deaths wore on, she failed at pills and failed at falling out of Uncle David's car and failed at sticking her head in the oven. She walked back and forth so often over a railroad bridge by her house that a neighbor didn't fail to report her.

Now, in the long afterward of grief, she felt less fiery heat and more intermittent pain like that of a spotty sandpaper burn that only required partial strength to keep her in the room. Was she getting better? She snorted. Older. She was getting older, never better.

She turned her attention to the icicle that was growing longer from the eaves every day as the gelid night freeze alternated with the day's warmth. Would it be better to be impaled by the ice dagger or simply clocked by its weight to reach oblivion? Clocked, definitely not impaled. That was way mo' better.

OG had been through fire and tried to jump about a million times. You start when you're into Hello Kitty and try to off yourself with an 11-year-old's life experience; you'll find out that a lack of executive function is no joke.

She was reminded of her first attempt. She'd heard pills were easy and found herself in the bath room at Uncle David's and Aunt Peggy's trying to find something lethal among all the healthy vitamins and Sam-E capsules and extra-strength glucosamine and turmeric and fish oil on offer. How was she to know that Ex-Lax would only make you shit yourself to death without delivering death itself.

Accountability Letter

The Impact Letter. A rite of torture? A consistent punishment or form of extreme torment by the Program which required the reader to account for her sins to the person she had sinned against, even though neither sinner nor sinned against wanted to hear it.

In her lifetime of almost two years at Inner Horizons, "the worst-run psychiatric treatment center on the West Coast, if not the US, as she'd overheard Darlene on the phone describing it to a colleague. OG had heard hundreds of Impact Letters. From Reza alone, a former meth addict, with the ADHD attention span of a gnat, she'd heard at least a dozen.

Oh my God, he was at it again. Hunched shoulders. Homeboy wanna be pants that threatened to fall off his skin-and-bone hips. Stumbling and mumbling and swallowing a thick New Jersey accent as he read.

LYDIA WAS KILLING TIME at the Student Union building till Sociology 101 when a heavily cut red haired guy in a muscle shirt parked himself at the cafeteria table. She had cleaned her boots with damp paper towels in the Lady's Room at the Student Union. Then, because she was always thirsty after throwing up, she clawed in the bottom of her purse for enough change to buy a cup of coffee. Between thed nail polish she'd bought to get rid of the Goth look and the doughnuts, she was irked to find that she came up short.

Muscle-boy with the rust-colored beard was still hunched at the same table. He was counting out and stacking small towers of pennies, dimes, and nickles. He looked up when she stopped at his side.

"I'll trade you a quickie for a cup of coffee," she said.

"What?" A broad freckled face looked blank. For a nanosecond, she wondered if he was fucking with her.

"You and me?" she said, gesturing over her shoulder toward the janitorial closet. "I know a place where no one will see us."

"Do I know you?"

"No, but but that's easy to fix."

His pale blue eyes looked polite but distrustful. "I'm sorry. I don't do that." He sounded like he was politely turning down another helping at dinner. Sorry Ma'am. Just full up.

"Aren't you into free sex?"

"I'm, ah, not \--." He cleared his throat. "I'm Mormon. I'm saving myself for my virgin wife."

The expression "virgin wife" was so odd that Lydia found herself stifling a laugh. What the hell was a "virgin" wife? A gaggle of slutty-looking NICC cheerleaders in short skirts that stretched over thighs the size of ham hocks were yukking it up a few tables over. One was applying lipstick and making obscene kissy faces at the hatchet-faced Indian jock next to her. Not a virgin in sight, as far as Lydia could see.

"Don't you like it?" she asked.

"I don't know." He seemed to wince at the use of the word sex in conversation. "I've never done it."

"Just how old are you?"

"Nineteen. I'll be twenty in March."

Lydia's experience with men and boys was wide and deep. This was a first for her. A 19-year-old male virgin who had just turned down sex the way you'd turn down a serving of Brussels sprouts. Her second turn down of the day. James Olson and now this guy. Was she losing her touch?

The coffee cup steamed between them on the table top. "Go ahead. You should drink it while it's hot. I don't want it that much."

She could see his naked longing for caffeine in his hesitation. She wondered if she had a similar longing on her face when she'd blurted out, "Would you like a quickie?" If she had, clown-boy certainly wasn't buying what she was selling.

She nudged the cup towards him. "Seriously. At least one of us should get what we want."

At the first swallow of caffeine, his hang-dog expression was replaced by bliss. "Oh man," he said. "you have no idea how much I needed this."

Her hollow stomach gave a low gurgle and she tasted a faint but definite taste of bile. Oh, I think I do.

It turned out his name was Lorenzo. A Mormon from Hillsdale, a small town in Southern Utah. His stepdad had dumped him at a bus station in Salt Lake City with \$75 in cash and a warning to not come back to Hillsdale, if he knew what was good for him.

"So now you're going to school here?" Lydia gestured at the NICC students around them who were eating or cramming or shooting the shit with their friends.

"No," he said. "I just interviewed for a job in the kitchen here as a short order cook." He shrugged. "I didn't get it. They only hire work-study kids."

Lydia had never heard of work-study. The girl's school in Lausanne taught things like deportment and conversational etiquette and how to plan an eight-course meal with special emphasis on presentation and flower arrangement.

His eyes had lit up when she set the steaming cup in front of him. But now his expression was guarded. Or was it disgust? Not exactly the reaction Lydia was used to getting when she offered sex to a 19-year-old boy.

"You're not gay, are you?" She backtracked in her mind to see if she'd missed something obvious about the big and freckly man-boy. A fluttery wrist? A hip-swinging gait? Any of the small myriad ways gay men advertised what they were looking for. He sat stolid and monumental as a lumberjack or a fisherman in worn Carrhardt pants and an open plaid flannel shirt with a collarless Henley-style thermal shirt faintly pockmarked with dimples. He certainly didn't look like a metrosexual, not that they were thick on the ground in Idaho, nor a typical Stetson-and-Lee-jeans cowhand, who were.

"It's OK if you are, of course," she said hurriedly, lest he think she was prejudiced. "My best friend in Detroit is gay. I just thought you looked lonely."

The side of his wide mouth quirked up. "Well, you're right about that. You just---well, you took my by surprise. I'm not used to girls like you being friendly."

"What do you mean by 'girls like me?' Do you mean because I asked you to have sex or because I offered you a cup of coffee?"

"No, no." He spread massive freckled hands the size of baseball mitts out in a sweeping gesture. "It's just---sex is forbidden until marriage in the Mormon church." This sounded like a pronouncement that the earth was flat or the sun revolved around the earth. It was the way the world was, with no questions asked.

"I've been having sex since I was 14," Lydia volunteered.

"Are you married?"

What an odd question. She felt like she was having a conversation with an alien who didn't know the first thing about the natives.

"You're just jerking my chain, aren't you?" she said. "Everybody knows what a quickie is."

"I beg your pardon," he said. "I do know what they are but it's not anything I've ever done."

"Oh, you're gay. Aren't you?" She hurriedly backtracked so as not to offend. "I mean, that's fine. Perfectly OK with me. Your choice and all that." She realized she was grinning inanely and she'd never felt more uncomfortable in her life.

"I'm not gay. That's a mortal sin to a Mormon."

"Oh?"

"It's just -- we don't believe in sex outside marriage."

"That's..." Unusual? Different? She searched her vocabulary for any word that wasn't ridiculous.

For a brief instant, she realized they were both looking at each other in the manner of two people confronted by a wild animal at the door.

"Don't\--!"

"Maybe\--!"

They both spoke over each other in an attempt to find a common bone to throw in the direction of the threat.

Lydia was killing time at the Student Union building till Sociology 101 when a heavily cut red haired guy in a muscle shirt parked himself at the cafeteria table across from her. She had been fantasizing about having sex with his faceless body until he turned to one side and revealed a farmer's beard that made his face look like a shovel.

It was perfectly clear to Lydia why she wanted to have sex with this new guy she didn't know at the Student Union, and Mr. Timms, the World History teacher with the pony keg of a paunch, and anyone else she might run into that day. Sex felt great during. It was just the after that didn't always feel so great.

She'd have wet stuff running down the inside of her leg and there was always that awkward moment before she could get her jeans on and re-zipped when two people who had just been intimate couldn't meet each others eyes. The guy was always saying it was mind blowing or it rocked his world or something equally lame but she could feel him drifting away from her before he got his shirt tucked into his pants. He'd run off with his buttons off kilter (James) or forget his jacket (Mr. Timms) or leave his shoe laces untied (the guy at the Circle K who handed her a Coke and said, "Bottoms up.") It was much more rewarding to think of the before when James or Mr. Timms or Randy---it took a minute to raise the name of the guy from the Circle K---when whoever it was would be burning with anticipation, a light sheen of sweat salting their neck, sperm cells marshaling to explode in a big hot whoosh.

Once the guy she used to fuck weekly in his pig truck flipped her a pack of condoms and said, "Here. Don't say I never gave you anything." What the hell was his name? She threw his stupid Trojan Featherlights in the trash. Not her brand. If she couldn't remember his name now, what did that mean? She remembered the way he flipped the condoms at her. The way you'd flip a shitty waitress a quarter to show her what you thought of her sullen service. This was after she'd knocked herself out and had been rewarded by the loopy, blissed out expression on his stupid face. Why would someone you just wanted to be close make you feel you ought to be a million miles away?

Lydia had a thing about facial hair. Beards, goatees, van Dykes, especially long sideburns and any size mustache, were immediate deal-killers.

Mr. Shovel Face was big and curly haired, built like a football player but super-tall. Six-five? Six-six? Lydia preferred muscular boys with styled hair not a halo of rusty red curls with a clown's curly beard. He looked like a jack-in-the box puppet she had as a kid if not as evil. He didn't seem likely to fly up and smack her in the jaw, which is what happened on her first encounter with Jack the Whack.

Mr. Shovel Face took his sick python biceps and his big lats over to the phone booth. It cost 50 cents to place a local call and Lydia had exactly \$1.03 cents to her name. In the Program, money was the controlled substance. It was hella-easy to get Prozac or Klonapine or occasionally, Valium, but it took an act of God to get a measly ten bucks. Maybe when Shovel Head gave up the dinosaur phone---Lydia wasn't actually sure she knew how to use one--she could talk him out of a couple quarters so she could call somebody in World History to borrow the notes from the class she missed.

Not having an I-phone was the tragedy of her life.

When the Inner Horizons staff packed her cell phone away, along with her new Apple Air laptop and her Bose mini-speakers and her Bluetooth headset, it felt like someone had ripped out her larynx. Her therapist, Darlene, told her that unplugging was good for her. It removed the crutch of superficial connections. "Pseudo connections", Darlene called them. But what if pseudo connections were all she could handle? Howzit going, 'sup? LOL, OMG. Texting with Mom was bad enough though nothing like the minefield of actually speaking to her.

Mr. Shovel Head was gesturing vehemently in the phone booth like somebody on the other end of the line didn't get it. Mom didn't get it either which is why Lydia and her mother had adopting texting as their main mode of communication. If the cut guy would text instead of talk, he could have controlled the conversation and steered it out of the bad space between them. Even Mom loved texting; she loved to tell anyone who would listen that texting was infinitely easier than talking to a nutcase teenager.

Really, though, Mom was the wack-job; she acted younger, even more out of control than Lydia. The day Grandpa Ben put her on a plane to Idaho, Mom drove out to their Grosse Pointe Shores Tudor to say goodbye. She was in her new red Corvette with a 22-year-old at the wheel. Lydia knew the driver, Jason Horvath. He was the year ahead of her in grade school. How embarrassing was that? Mom, in tight Lulu Lemon pants, a lacy red bra hanging out of her camisole, glued to Jason's arm like she needed him to stand up. For being 46, Mom looked pretty hot (all the beauty money and a good cosmetic surgeon could buy, she liked to say). Plus she lived on rice cakes and nonfat-yogurt which meant she was starved enough to take down a deer. The last thing she had said to Lydia was, \"I hope you grow up in Idaho. You should be at least twelve by the next time I see you.\" If Mom were supposed to be only a year older than Lydia, how the hell would she know when her daughter outgrew her?

Shovel Face was counting out coins on the tabletop when she came back from the cafeteria with a cup of coffee. Methodically separating quarters from dimes and nickels.

\"What are you doing?\" she asked, coming up to the table to stand next to him.

He looked around to locate who was talking to him. When he saw her, he stopped. "Counting my money."

\"I see that. Why?\"

He blinked lake blue eyes. \"To see if I have enough for a cup of coffee.\"

\"Do you?\"

\"No.\"

Lydia didn\'t know what possessed her but she set her untouched coffee next to the neat piles of coins.

\"I haven\'t touched it,\" she said. "Go ahead."

The big man-boy rocked back in his chair. He was younger than she thought. He wore a flannel mountain man shirt with a tear in the elbow and a waffle weave undershirt. Not exactly Abercrombie and Fitch. He seemed to hesitate, but then she smiled and he let the legs of the chair settle forward. He said, \"God, I need this," and grabbed the cup.

They both laughed.

She sat down.

His name was Lorenzo.

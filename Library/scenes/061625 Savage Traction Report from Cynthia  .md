Deadline 1, June 16, 2025

NEW + GOOD REPORT

The power of the Savage beast and her clear deadlines worked better than a whip!

The minute I agreed to June 16 as our first deadline, my project management skills from 30 years in advertising kicked in. I figured out all the tasks needed to get to a draft of a sequence I have been putting off for years: Lydia's Death March (working title).

In Dropbox, you'll find Lydia's Death March in three parts. My intention is to interleave Lydia's scenes with those of the protagonist, OG, who is out on the same January night, walking under the same frigid moon in rural Couer D'Alene toward a new life in my next deadline.

Lydia's Death March is likely too long but it's shaped and complete and can be whittled down when I juxtapose Lydia's scenes with OG's.

I reengaged with my story deeply in the process. I see that there is a ton of good writing and insightful character work plus a plot caused by consequences of my characters[']{dir="rtl"} own making. They feel like living, breathing people stuck in a part hell-part limbo at Inner Horizons which is both a state-of-mind and a real place in Idaho. It feels good to see that the place itself has become a character with rules that are supposed to help the kids in lockup but truly make them crazy.

In addition to crafting Lyda's Death March, I made a good dent in compiling and tightening all Lydia's scenes into a complete character arc compilation.

TRICKY BITS

The good news is I am now reengaged with my novel; the bad news is there is a mountain of story to work with. My wildly generative mind and daily writing habit have generated 20 pages for every page I keep.

I could use some strategy work on how to wrestle with "too muchness." Maybe because of the accretive way I generate scenes by writing them numerous times, I should just ignore the early stuff and concentrate on the most recent work that is the thickest and most developed.

I also have some version control problems with Scrivener. This is the result of starting and stopping work on this novel for more than ten years. Let's talk about how to clean this up. There's a funny story about the great artist and print maker Hokusai who worked in 17th C Japan in an insanely messy way. Apparently the great master up and moved out of his messes, leaving them behind him so he could start over in a clean, pristine studio. That's how I feel.

At this point, I think I should believe in the treasure trove I have created and not worry too much about finding the perfect jewel when I can pull out another one.

ACCOUNTABILITY SINCE I STARTED

•. Redrafted and crafted a complete draft of Lyda's Death March in 3 scenes: 1) Jed kidnaps her from NICC campus 2) Ned beats Lydia at the Shooting Range in the hills above Coeur D'Alene Lake 3) Lydia is left behind to walk back to the highway and falls asleep in a tree well

•. I made a pretty good dent in a compilation of all Lydia's scenes and am at work on crafting and tightening the scenes so I end up with a complete character arc for this character.

•. I have made good progress on "revisioned" writes of OG's opening of the novel. I have transcribed a bunch of these writes from January 2025. Between what I have already written and the plan described below, I am thinking that the task of crafting a new opening will not be half as onerous as I have been telling myself.

FOCUSS FOR THE NEXT DEADLINE

•. My goal for the next deadline of June 30 is to have completed Lydia's scene compilation with tight drafts of her complete character arc.

I would also like arrive by June 30 at a pretty tight draft (a la Lyda Death March this deadline) for OG's Escape/Walking Rusty Up to His Exit After Crash/ OG Lights out for the Territories.

It's not clear to me how long these OG penultimate scenes will take. They are gnarly and hard like Lydia's Death March. It may be that I need to slide their competition to July 14, the third Savage deadline. I'll know by June 30 if I can hit an OG Escape draft because it's a big job.

NEXT STEPS + ACTIONS

I have roughed out a work plan for how to get to character arc compilations of all 6 POV characters. It looks to me like I'll need another month of the Savage Whip beyond the two months we agreed to. We can discuss when you have time to organize a Zoom after Thriller fest.

I am very happy and centered right now with my progress. I feel like scheduling a Zoom somewhere after your return from the mystery conference and before my next deadline on 6/30 will work great.

I don't need a lot of hand holding. It tickles me no end to see that it's the the power of the deadline that is propelling me :-)

010719 Reza reimagined

Black, slick hair, very dark, which highlights how warm and sunny brown his face is as if he carried palm trees or palm nuts in his genetics. He was smart but ADHD took up so much of his personality, you'd never know it. He couldn't help himself any more than James could help himself with his own addictions. Reza's chemicals are haywire inside while James feels like he's always searching for chemicals outside to complete what he's obviously missing.

His dad was an investment guru, a numbers guy, high up at Goldman Sachs. Mom, a stay-at-home mother who wore saris, had a dot on her forehead and walked ten spaces behind his dad on the street. High, high expectations which Reza could never meet. He liked chemistry, hence his meth troubles.

Everyone at the program thought he was a gnat or a midge or a flying pest. Even his voice was high like an insect. The Indian habit of ending sentences on a high note didn't help.

"And by the way, quit calling your roommate 'Apu'. It's not cool," Josh said.

James blinked. Who cared what he called Reza. He would drive a saint nuts and James was only human.

"What do you care?" he asked.

"How would you feel if Reza called you a dumb blond or Kewpie Doll?"

"It's not the same."

"It's exactly the same. A stereotype. Apu is what everybody thinks all Indians are. Shopkeepers with high voices. Did you know his dad is the chief economist at Goldman Sachs?"

"No."

"Do you ever talk to him?"

Reza was always talking to James. "not if I can help it."

"Does he talk to you?"

"Can't get him to shut up. If I talk back, it'll get worse."

"Well start with calling him Reza. Baby steps."

"I thought we were talking about my relationship with Rachel."

"We are."

Hmmm. Josh's cryptical elliptical comments generally had a point. James had worked with him long enough to know that. Was he a racist? If not a racist, a stereotype? A generalizer? Reza didn't remind of Apu, not really. He was a midge, a gnat, some constantly buzzing, circling insect he was always trying to slap down but Reza was so quick, he'd always get away.

Was it possible there was a real person inside the ADHD, meth-addled package? One could only hope, as his mother liked to say.

James to Reza re girls

"No girlfriend, huh?"

Reza picked at a scab on his knee. "My family believes in arranged marriage." He spoke in a high, sing-song Indian accent. "Rezaya, there'll be no dateeng until after marriage!"

"I thought that was illegal."

Reza rolled his bright dark eyes. "No one makes you do it. You just do it to yourself because your parents had it done to them."

"Why don't you say no?"

"Have you met my mother? Try refusing her. It's like running into the invisible bricks. She can't be knocked down."

James went off to the shower. He noticed that Reza, in typical ADD mode, had left his tennis shoes in the bathroom. Throw the dog a bone, he told himself, and carried the walked-down-at-the-heel shoes back to their room without saying, "don't say I never do anything for you." And because he didn't say that, it felt natural not to call him Apu either. Baby steps.

"Reza's totally irritating," James said in protest.

"He can't help it. He's ADHD."

"Half the kids in Malibu are on Adderall. Why not him?"\
"He's on Adderall."

"And this is what he's like on drugs? What, is he a ping pong ball without them?"

It was Josh's turn to roll his eyes. The whites were startling in his polished teak face. "Just cut him some slack is all I'm saying. He doesn't act this way to piss you off. He can't help it."

"Why don't you just help me get a new roommate?"

"Because helping doesn't work that way. What if Reza has something to teach you?"

"Besides 'thou shalt not kill'?"

"Throw him a bone, James. Take Apu out of your vocabulary."

James's mind was running through a list of Apu substitutes: monkey, Simba, orangutang, midget, idiot, shit for brains. Fine, he thought, deep-six Apu and upvote monkey's paw. If Reza woke up screaming again tonight, he was going to put a sock in his mouth.

"He's annoying!"

"So are you. I don't go around talking like a valley girl to you because you piss me off."

James said stiffly, "I don't do valley speak."

"Like... absolutely, dude. Cowabunga." Josh was shaking his head, smiling.

"Cow-fucking-abung. Matt Gruening had a lot to answer for, thought James. Or was that from the guy who wrote Snoopy? Sam diff.

Reza in his tight whites and undershirt looked undersized and slightly bow legged. His brown hairy legs were wide-set on his hips so he walked like a South Asian cowboy, slopping along in running shoes that he had walked down at the heel like slippers. If he weighed more than 120 pounds, James would have been surprised.

"Didn't your mother feed you enough," he asked suddenly. "You look like you were starving at one time."

Reza blinked. "My dad's a managing partner at Goldman Sachs. My mother would die if she heard you say that. I've always had plenty to eat."

"You're pretty...". James wanted to say 'underfed' and settled on 'skinny.'

"I'm vegetarian," Reza said, like James was a dope. "We don't eat meat. Indian people aren't cow-fat like Americans." He gestured toward James like he was lumping him into all the overweight people they'd seen at Walmart buying huge bags of chips.

"Sorreee," James muttered. This cultural sensitivity stuff was more trying than it looked.

"Look on my bright side, James," Reza said, a minute later.

"Why?"

"When you're fifty, you've weigh over 250 pounds and I'll still be able to wear the same clothes."

"Oh good," James said, thinking that'll be the day. Judging from Reza's expression, he was thinking the same exact thing. It would be thirty years before they both realized they were wrong.

010819 Reza

Reza's problem is that he has a white, privileged and clueless room mate he both admired and wanted to be like but at the same time, hated himself for wanting his friendship and respect. It would have been so much easier to be James instead of a small, bowlegged, not very attractive brown guy in Idaho where they didn't even know what he was. Idaho people had never heard of Pakistan, didn't know a Paki from an Indian and thought all his relatives were in Isis or I-rack.

Reza wants James to like him. Be his buddy. Talk to him. Instead he's always telling him to shut up or stop tapping. He can't help rolling his pensil on his work desk; it relaxes him. He doesn't even know he's doing it, really, it's just easier to keep something moving near him because his insides are jangly and his body is barely within his control.

It's like being on a constant coffee high, except Reza only drinks tea. He doesn't eat beef which is a problem in meat-heavy Idaho. The cook's idea of vegetarian meals is a daily garden burger defrosting on the inside and burned on the outside on his plate.

No dating till after marriage, he thinks. Like being in hell with a constant hard-on that has a mind of its own.

Reza has a good voice, a sense of perfect rhythm and pitch. He's good at chemistry, hence not getting blown sky high when he cooked his first batch of meth. Too bad he got caught; he was just figuring out a set of safety protocols that he planned to blog about.

One time he was walking with James down a street in Couer d'Alene when some kids in a pick-up drove boy and shouted "nigger" at him. He didn't even realize they were aiming their catcalls at him.

"Doesn't that make you mad?" James asked.

"What?" Reza was busy working out a tune inside his head. He liked to write music on the inside of his eyeballs as he walked.

"Didn't you hear them shout at you?"

"No. What's they want?"

"They called you..." James hesitated. "...the 'N' word."

His sister called him a noodge so often that was the first thing he thought of. "A noodge? Better than being called a Paki. I don't think they know that word in Idaho."

"They call you a nigger, Reza."

"Really? Is that a step up from Paki or a step down?"

"I think it's worse."

"Hmmm," Reza said. "At least they didn't call me bowlegged. I hate that."

Jesus, James thought for perhaps the first time, what a trial to be Reza. Not black. Not white. Not anything in no-nothing Idaho except small, strange, suspect and on top of everything else, clueless.

"Go back where you came from." One of the guys, the one with the Confederate flag in the truck bed, shouted.

"Back to New Jersey? I wish," said Reza. "Give me a ticket and I'm out of here."

In Great Britain where he and his family lived for his first 12 years of life, they would have shouted "bloody Paki" or "mophead" or "raghead" or something equally vile. In Idaho, they didn't know what to call him. He wasn't a nigger. Wasn't a Jap or a Chink or a stinking Injun. When the truck came around again for another pass, the guys in the truck settled for "go home you fucking monkey." That seemed the end of their powers of imagination. One of them spit -- a big glob of wet viscous glop -- on the pavement closet to where James and Reza were standing.

"Monkey," James repeated. Rolled his eyes. "That's clever."

"Better than Jesus H. Christ," Reza said. "Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain."

"is that in the Koran?"

"The Bible, stupid. I thought you were Christian."

"I am. But that doesn't mean I read the Bible."

"I don't read the Koran either so I guess we're even."

They crossed the street, making sure the truck wasn't coming around again to run them over.

What would it be like to have strangers shouting at you in the street? James was used to being in the majority, just one of the boys -- the incident really bothered him. It was OK for him to call Reza a monkey but when random guys in a truck did it, he saw it as unsettling and menacing.

"Does that happen to you a lot?"

"Once in a while."

James looked around at the white shopkeeper who was sweeping his sidewalk in front of a shoe store, at a white mom with two white kids walking on the other side of the street, at a drunk Indian coming out of the Big Chief liquor store. Everybody was white -- well, except the Indian guy, who was less than white in Idaho, somewhere down in the dregs with the rats and squirrels. What would it be like to never see people like yourself? James had plenty of black friends on the team at USC so he didn't think of himself as racist. He thought he was pretty open. Politically correct. He'd never call someone a nigger or a raghead. Then he remembered a night or two ago at dinner when he said to Reza, "Hey monkey man, pass the butter, would you?" Clueless, he thought. Then he thought something even worse. Had Rachel heard him call Reza a monkey. Politically correct, am I? I'm an idiot.

"You're a typical white male of privilege. Good hearted in a lot of ways but also clueless about your roommate. Sure, Reza has annoying qualities. It's not OK to treat him as subhuman."

James thought this was patently unfair. He knew Reza was a human being but humanity was pretty far down on his agenda. He was just trying to get through the day in his own morass of shame and self-loathing.

"Reza has feelings?"

"Of course he has feelings," Josh said. "Use your head."

James head was typically employed in figuring out how to kill him or maim him at various points in the day for irritating the shit out of him.

"Would it kill you to be nice to him once a day?"\
He'd die of shock, was James' first thought. His second was, or I would.

Thus in small steps do we all make progress toward opening our hearts and letting the other in. But it will be years before James figures that out. He'll work with a young Indian man named Riyad who reminds him of Reza. Riyadh is from India. He's Hindi, not muslim. James will have grown old enough or broad enough by then to know the difference which he wasn't when he was in treatment. He will ask, apropos of nothing, what Riyadh's name means and when the slight South Asian man with the same golden coloring as Reza says, "contentment" something will strike a chord. He's amazed when he looks up the name and sees that both Resa and Riyadh are from the same root and have similar meaning. Who knows whether Reza ever reached contentment post-treatment? He wished he'd asked him at the time about his name but since he didn't, he asked Riyadh about his family and where he comes from and he remembers and uses his name when he sees him in the cafeteria.

Reza's apology in snow cave

He caused the snow cave collapse in his need to run off steam. He just felt better moving or his anxiety got the better of him. He was apologizing for losing his awareness of his surroundings, he wasn't thinking, he was just horsing around, playing chase, working off built-up energy like you work off that crazy feeling of wanting to blow. "I wasn't thinking, I was just ... running. It's like being taken over by somebody else. I just have to run it off, round and round, to get rid of the feeling that I'm going to explode. I didn't mean to, I didn't think... I wasn't thinking... it's not like I'm doing it on purpose, it's just.... Automatic. It comes over me and all I want to do is keeping going until I drop. When the snow cave collapsed, that's what I thought happened. I ran myself into collapse. I didn't know it was the snow that gave in. I thought it was me. Do you understand? I thought it was me.

Old Girl would get a phrase every now and then... didn't mean to ... couldn't help myself ... makes me want to blow... takes over... wasn't thinking.... just moving... can't help ... have to run. What the hell? Was Reza apologizing? To whom? Not to her. TO HER? Holy Jesus, tears were streaking down his warm brown, earnest face. He had an expression or longing or suffering or pain -- it was all registering on his face at once -- and then he was down in front of her, reaching for her. His body was shaking convulsively and his face seemed to break apart into a brown eye, a grimacing mouth, a low sound of toneless hurt that came from somewhere deep inside like an animal.

He grabbed her around her waist. His dark wavy hair pressed up under her breastbone, something wet her neck near the collar of her sweater. And then, unbelievably, it got worse because then everybody was gathering around her, squeezing inward, people clapping her on the back, Dani butting her in the shoulder, James putting his arm around her, Rachel beating her on the back , more hands, voices, bodies pressing in on her so that it felt like she was running out of air. The peaceful alone sensation she had felt yesterday was replaced by panic and fear and a desire to run like hell. But she couldn't. Reza had her in a death grip around her waist. He made a low moaning noise like a lowing cow that needed to be milked.

I can't help it, he cried. And launched his whole body at her like a missile of brown-skinned, big eyed woe.

She expected him to smell like turmeric or curry past. Instead he smelled like minty-tooth paste and attar of roses soap.

Rachel glanced at James with astonishment. She shuttered her face, then, and turned away from him, leaving the monkey man comment to fester.

121818 Old Girl on Rusty at death

Re Lydia

She's not thinking about dying. She's just so tired, so all in, dead on her feet. She thinks of that thing her mother always says to her. Go on without me and rejects it out of hand. What has that bitch taught her? Nothing. I won't go on without you. As if in response to her thought, she spots a cleared space, a well of blow-out at the base of a towering Ponderosa tree. It looks like a den, sort of. A space, more like a gap cleared of snow at the base of the tree. Invitingly dark and closed in on three sides by snow which has drifted up the sides of the trunk providing a place of rest. Some animal has made it. It seems trampled on or matted down from an elk or a deer or a badger or a wolverine or cougar, perhaps the one she saw, some live, warm animal who turned in circles like a friendly dog, until it found the best position to settle in for a winter's nap.

OG

OG sits for a long time in the cold truck while she holds the man's cooling hand. For a while, he gripped back but as the time between his breaths lengthened and the blood flow to the floor beneath his feet slowed to a drip.... drip...... drip....... with longer and longer pauses between each drip. His hand relaxed and it got very quiet except for an occasional sough of wind in the upper boughs of the tree above them. A rattle in his throat. Then nothing for a long arid time. It's just the two of them: they could be friends, holding hands on a starry night, or father and daughter waiting for Mom to come home, even though that's never going to happen for either of them in this lifetime. She wonders if they all died simultaneously or if Mom held Dad's hand or if one of them reached out to the put their hands on Gabe's head and was with him when the light went out in his eyes.

She sits for so long that her feet are blocks of ice and she has no feeling in her fingers that are holding a dead man's digits. It feels like she's in a fugue state, everything silent, the stars bright and sharp, indifferent to the fact that the man who was so warm to her touch has now grown cold and waxen.

So this is it, she thinks. Wishing to turn the clock back, wishing to see the light in the man's dark eyes as he begs her not to leave him. He's left her, she realizes, without her knowing the exact moment that he departed the truck, although she never let go of his hand. One minute it was warm; the next time she thought about it, it was cooling and his labored breath was gone while a slight breeze whiffled a dusting of snow through the broken glass like floating ash.

She has no desire to join him wherever he went. All her days and months and years of thinking about dying are as dust to dust and ashes to ashes in the face of its reality. She has to get moving. The will to move helps her clamber past the blades of glass that stick out like feral teeth where the windshield used to be. She nearly falls when she jumps and hits the ground. Her feet are without feeling and clumsy in the cold but she manages to stay upright and stumble through the deep snow, getting so much snow in her boots, she has to sit down on the glassy road and dump the clumps out before she can walk on.

A friendly \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Cascade milk man -- maid, actually -- in a hat with fur ear flaps and a big puffy jacket plus a blanket around her knees, picks her up about a mile down the road.

"What has you out so early?" the milk man asks and that's when OG realizes that underneath the hat and coat and scar and earflaps and blanket is a grandmotherly woman in her seventies.

"I've got an early shift at McDonald's" she lies, remember the Golden Arches miles ahead at the entrance to I-90.

"You have to walk to work every morning?" the woman asks.

"Oh no," she says. "My car broke down" which is in a way true when she thinks of the garbage truck nestled against the big tree at the bottom of the hill.

"Well, I hope it gets fixed soon," the milk lady says. "It's colder than a witch's tit, this morning."

Ah, the witch's tit, she thinks. Shut your pie hole. "Yes it is," Maybe even colder, if that's possible."

They talk companionably until the milk lady lets her off at the door to McDonald's. She drives off with a one-fingered Idaho salute, where only a finger comes off the wheel, to acknowledge one's presence on a rural road.

What was it that got her moving. She clambers clumsily past the shards of glass, careful to avoid getting snagged. She has to jump three feet down from the precarious cab and she lands in snow up to her hips, then has to half crawl, half-crabwalk out of its grasp and plow her way up the berm. She gets so much snow in her booths that she has to sit down on the glossy ice-patched road and empty the clumps out to be able to walk.

A milk man -- milk lady, it will turn out --picks her up a mile down the road in a Pleasant Meadows Creamery truck. The driver is dressed in two down coats, a wool scarf, big puffy mittens and a fur hat with ear flaps so it takes hearing her voice to realize she is a grandmotherly woman of indeterminate age.

"Are you born to be saved?" she asks conversationally after OG climbs in.

Was there an answer to that? "I guess," OG says tentatively.

"Well good thing. It's colder than a witches' tit this morning. If you weren't saved, you'd be froze to death."

The woman doesn't question her story that her car has broken down on the way to a morning shift at McDonald's. Kindly, in the Idaho rural way, she drops OG off right at the door to the Golden Arches. She gives her the one-finger-raised salute of rural Idaho drivers who keep both hands on the wheel while acknowledging your passing.

What was it that got her moving. She couldn't have said then what she had to figure out years later. She was just done with that part of life. She'd learned enough to get moving, to stumble down from the precariously perched cab which had driven part-way up the Ponderosa trunk, to a squishy landing in deep snow that she had to fight ti get up the berm. She took in so much snow in her boots, she sat down on the glossy road and dumped out enough for a small burial.

What was it that got her moving? The man was so still. The drip-drip-drip of the blood on the floor mat had long ceased. He was no longer in the truck with her, though she'd felt his electricity and the warmth in his hands and his need for her presence minutes before. He was alive one minute. Took a few rattling breaths with longer and longer pauses between them and then, as mysteriously as she had met him, he was gone.

For an instant, she wished she could turn the clock back. Wished she could see the glint of life in his eyes, feel the tight grip on her fingers that told her he was desperate and afraid. But now his hands were relaxed. The grip was gone like the rest of him.

And she was done. Ready to move on with her life and her plans and her next step, one after the other, that made her clamber down from the precarious angle of the cab which had driven a short way up the thick Ponderosa trunk, bending it with its weight. She made a three feet drop into soft deep snow

The milk truck trundled off in a ching-ching-ching of chains;. OG was suddenly struck by the thought of the raccoons on the night of the fire. The strange floral burst of neon colors out of darkness. Each radioactive bloom centered by a masked feral face and the sound of hissing. Use it or lose it, she was thinking. Does that apply to the wonders of this world? If it does, I'll remember this night forever.

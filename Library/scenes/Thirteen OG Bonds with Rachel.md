YOU LEAKED OUT FEELINGS AND pain at your peril at Inner Horizons. OG's first therapist, who\'d left the program after three months because she hated Crazy Hazey and needed to make a living wage, had been unrelenting in her quest to get Old Girl to \"open up.\" You\'re only hurting yourself, Rosa liked to say.

She also liked: The truth will set you free; Open your heart and let me in; The heart is a lonely hunter; and honesty is the best policy.

"No woman no cry, was OG's contribution.

Bull shit to honesty. If you got close to anybody at the Program, they either ratted you out or they left. Rosa, whom she\'d secretly admired, had escaped to Seattle, hadn\'t she? Now OG was stuck with Dr. Hazey for a therapist.

Across the room from her, her new roommate was huddled in the bed with a crazy quilt over her head. Every few minutes a hand would snake out from the sheets and grope the bedside table for more Kleenex. So far, the hand had made five Kleenex forays.

Finally, OG addressed the lump under the covers. "If you keep that up, you\'re going to be buried in snot rags."

A long pause.

Rachel peeked her head out of the blankets, then emerged in a cascade of Kleenex balls to yank on the lamp. Old Girl had been writing a list of stuff she needed to pack, her page lit by the headlamp she wore on her forehead like a spelunker. She scribbled a reminder to be sure to take it with her.

Rachel rootled around in the sheets for Kleenex blobs and dumped a wad in the Hello Kitty garbage can they shared.

\"Rough day?\" Old Girl asked. \"Or are you saving your boogers?\"

\"You must be used to it by now.\"

\"Used to baring your soul and letting people eat it with potato chips?" Old Girl inspected the raveling end of her longest dreadlock, crossing her eyes in an attempt to focus on the ginger-colored rat. \"You sort of get used to it.\"

\"Are you?"

"What?"

"Used to it?\"

Oh fuck. Not a good time to reach out and touch someone, she thought to herself. She faux-casually removed her headlamp, hoping that Rachel would get the message that a slumber party was going to be over before it started.

\"Reach out and touch someone," Rachel said. "Is that a song?\"

\"No, some old ad campaign. My mom used to sing the jingle.\"

\"My mom died when I was born," Rachel said.

Oh double fuck and fuckity duck. Now what? There was no way Old Girl was going to share with Rachel that she lost her mom too. Why make it seem like she wanted to be friends when she didn't? She said, "I killed mine."

\"What? With your jokes?\"

Old Girl snorted a laugh, despite herself. "Smart ass," she said, with genuine admiration. "You're quick."

Both girls, one red eyed and sniffling, the other closed up like a clam, sized each other up.

Then Old Girl said suddenly, "My mother really is dead." She wondered fleetingly if she'd been taken over by a stranger who'd commandeered her throat. Her words seemed to sail out of her dark and dreary corner to shed a warm glow on Rachel\'s reddish-brown skin.

"Mine isn't. I just wish she was." Rachel gestured to the bedside table with a picture of two white people beaming on either side of a tall black girl in a graduation cap. "That's me and her with Dad. I'm adopted."

Old Girl\'s heart flexed the least little bit in Rachel\'s direction. It was a rare experience at Healing House when someone surprised her.

\"What do you think of James?\" Rachel asked.

\"He\'s OK. Kind of a jock boy."

\"Can you trust him?\"

Whoo boy. "With what? Your virginity? I can trust him to hog the treadmill."

Rachel laughed. \"He seems nice.\"

"He's kind of clueless. He's always calling Reza names. Apu. Tiny Man. Midget. Gnat Boy. Mr. ADD. It drives Reza nuts," said OG.

"You mean Apu from the Simpsons? The little Indian guy?"

"Among others."

"So, blue eyed and dumb ass. Too bad."

OG turned the page. The boys were getting ready to stone Piggy. "Reza's annoying as shit though. I'm glad I don't have to live with him."

"Glad to know I just moved up a rung on your ladder."

"Don't get cocky. Maybe you and Reza share the same rung."

"Because he's brown and I'm black, you mean?"

Oh, Jesus H Christ. Why was the English language such a mine field? "Crap! No.That's not what I meant."

Rachel reached out to rescue her book, Stranger in a Strange Land, from sliding off the crazy quilt that covered her legs. "People in Idaho probably think Reza comes from the reservation."

> "He does, kind of. The rez of Inner Horizons where everybody is a pariah."
>
> "Glad to know I'm with my peeps."

"Are you liking that?" OG gestured to the book. She was about to say that Rachel would soon be a Stranger in a Familiar Land but said instead, "I hope it's more uplifting than *Lord of the Flies.*"

Rachel laughed. A clear bell-like tone. " So why are you reading it?

"Story of my life," OG answered, though it was actually for English Lit. "Why are you reading *Pariah's in a Strange Land*?"

Rachel looked at the Heinlein cover with the solitary black man. "No reason. Makes me think, I guess."

> "About James? That's interesting."
>
> "He is gorgeous."
>
> "Too bad he's braindead, not that Lydia gives a shit about his brains."
>
> "They're an item?"
>
> "If giving blowjobs makes them an item. Lydia's a nympho."
>
> "No wonder we're pariahs."
>
> "What can I say? Every DSM in the book is here."

How long has he been in treatment? Rachel wanted to know.

"I don't know. Six-seven months? He came here from wilderness camp, someplace in Bumfuck, Utah.\"

\"Bumfuck, Utah, to Bumfuck, Idaho. Good progress."

\"It\'s not Idaho. It\'s You Da Hoe,\" Old Girl said.

\"Udahoe?\"

\"You Da Hoe, if you fuck around with James. It's against the rules."

\"What do they care?\" Rachel asked.

\"Pregnancy? STDs? Chlamydia? If one person has crabs, then everybody gets them.\"

\"Ewww! Grosss.\" Rachel wrinkled her nose. \"You\'re kidding, right?\"

Old Girl ostentatiously scratched her crotch. \"Not really.\"

Personally, Old Girl's crabs were on the inside. Sure, people like James were alcoholics and druggies; Reza was a meth addict; Dani had some incurable narcissistic wound that made her a psychopath; other people were just plain old immature or didn't want to grow up. But they still had intact families. People loved them, no matter how fucked up they were. What did Old Girl have? A beleaguered and stressed aunt and uncle who were doing their best for her to the detriment of their own kids and precarious finances. Aunt Peggy and Uncle David tried hard to make her feel like a part of the family but she was alone and she knew it.

\"Mom and Dad try so hard to understand me but I swear, they make me feel like I'm always eating glass.\" She recounted a long litany of how Rachel's dad took her to hip-hop classes until she finally got up the courage to tell him she hated rap. Her mother signed her up to volunteer for the NAACP every week when all Rachel wanted to do was take more ballet classes. The story from the past that irked her the most was when her mother organized a play dates with the house cleaner\'s children. Two little black girls came over and when one of them got a load of her deluxe black Barbie collection, she asked, " What\'s wrong wit\' you? How come Barbie ain' white?"

"Just because my parents are old and white doesn't give them a pass to be clueless," Rachel said. "My mom wanted to name me Rosa Parks Cathcart."

Old Girl made a neutral noise in the back of her throat ."Could have been worse." "Hell yeah. Dad wanted Sojourner Truth."

\"So how did they arrive at Rachel?\"

\"My name isn\'t Rachel. It\'s Rosa Truth Tubman Cathcart.\"

\"I don\'t get it.\"

\"Rachel is my grandmother\'s name. She asked them to call me Rachel when she was dying and they couldn't turn her down."

Okayyyy. Families were definitely weird. Annoying as hell but they were still your family and not in a cemetery in Duluth.

James thought you were dying, OG volunteered, apropos of nothing.

"When?"

"Today. When you had your gaping fish moment."

"That's what you call epilepsy? A gasping fish moment."

It had looked like an electrical charge. A lightning bolt, maybe. Somebody near OG had breathed, "Freddie Krueger" but what happened to her wasn't movie-type alien. It was more primitive than that. Rachel seemed plugged into an electric source that kept circulating and zapping her. Her heels tattooed against the floor. Her neck arched. Her teeth clacked. It didn't even look like she was in her body. It looked like someone else had taken over.

"Gaping, gasping. What does it matter?" OG turned a page away from the stoning. "You looked like a trout. The way you were opening and closing your jaws."

"Oh my God. I didn't."

"James didn't notice. He was too busy keeping your legs from tap-dancing."

"Jesus H. Christ. Kill me now."

"He wanted to hold your head but Darlene said you might bite him."

Deep, profound silence. The expression on Rachel's face was slightly nauseated.

OG had never before seen the body take over and drive itself. In her experience, even in extreme pain and grief, she'd always been in charge.

James had been wide-eyed, appalled while Rachel was seized by electricity. "What should we do?" he cried, voice high and thin.

"No!" Darlene barked at him. "Stay away from her mouth. She'll bite you." When Darlene said, "Grab her by the ears. Like a jug," James looked like Darlen'es words hit him in the solar plexus.

"It could have been worse." OG tried to help out a little. "At least you didn't pee in your pants."

"I did. Good thing I was wearing black pants."

Hmm. "Well if somebody noticed then, you'd know about it by now."

"Oh great." Rachel's voice came to OG muffled again because it had to make its way through the blankets she'd thrown back over her head. "I really do want to kill myself."

The one bone OG could think to throw, even though she was afraid it was dangerously friendly, was a gesture of solidarity. OG raised both hands up, towards her roommate, her wrists outward and held them there without moving.

A second or so later, Rachel peeked and then, slowly, one of her hands emerged from the covers. Her thin brown wrist faced OG's. They had matching scars: The suicide fuck-up's salute.

Most people in the Program talked non-stop about their problems and after few days, all you wanted was to make them shut up so you could hear the wind sighing in the trees.The girl in the other bed seemed comfortable with silence, something that made Old Girl warm to her. Rachel said, "That's lame about James and Reza. What's he thinking?"

"His dick does the thinking for him."

"With Reza?"

Rachel's expression fell and OG felt compelled to correct her. "James definitely isn't gay. I don't know if he's bi. The only hetero action I've seen is with Lydia."

Rachel was half-sitting in the manner of Rodney Dangerfield, Aunt Peggy's uber-smart border collie. Rodney was the smarter than most of the people in treatment. You could talk to him and when he tilted his head in that intelligent way, you'd swear he was about to answer.

"There's no relationship there. Lydia's just a sex fiend. She'll fuck anything that walks. Well, except for Dr. Hazey and nobody knows if he can get it up.\"

Rachel nodded. \"Hazey is kind of smarmy. He said he thought I just needed some self-actualization.\"

Self-actualization. What Dr. Hazey sold to anxious parents while refusing to let his charges develop a self without being locked up or drugged.

Is Hazey a stoner? Rachel's wanted to know. "When he did my intake session, he was slurring his words.\"

\"Everybody\'s a stoner around here. Why not Hazey?\"

\"You\'re full of questions,\" Rachel said, wagging her finger at Old Girl.

\"That\'s because I don\'t have any answers." OG stuffed her headlamp in the backpack next to her bed and gestured to the bedside lamp. Sharing time was over. "Do you mind?"

Rachel took the hint. She extracted a few more used Kleenex from her sheets, blew her nose and fluffed her pillow. "You're a nut."

"Takes one to know one, Tubman." OG left *Lord of the Flies* on the table and marked it off her list. She was done reading about anything tribal forever. "At least you're in good company."

While she set her alarm, she was thinking that it was going to be a short night. Too bad she had to leave now that she knew Tubman had a sense of humor. It was so rare to find someone who laughed at her suicide jokes.

OG dropped off to sleep wondering what Rachel would think tomorrow when she woke up to an empty room.

062015 Hazey house description

The dining table had a grouping of sad water-starved poinsettias down the center. Once upon a time, somebody must have thought the arrangement looked festive. Now, a month after Christmas, spindly growth reached weakly for the sun and withered leaves scattered across the aggressively shiny black table surface.

She found Hazey's glass and concrete house easily. His was the only aggressively contemporary house among a collection of massive log "cabins" that were supposed to look rustic but were five times bigger times than the cabin Margaret had grown up in.

It was easy to find Hazey's enormous glass and concrete house. It was the only aggressively contemporary place in a neighborhood of designer log houses that were supposed to look like cabins but were five times larger than the cabin Margaret had grown up in. Hazey's driveway was not only clear of snow but completely dry. Shit and Shinola! Dr. Hazey had a *heated* driveway?

Margaret's lower back seized at the sight of snow melting on the edges of three foot bank of snow on either side of blue slate and rusty-earth-colored slabs. She'd spend an hour this morning shoveling her ten-year-old Suburban out of the rutted and nearly impassable country lane she and Hank lived on. Hank couldn't lift a bag of dog food since the accident. All the outdoor jobs now fell to Margaret.

Slate, mind you. Beautiful river-blue slabs striated with rusty orange streaks dry as a desert. The seizure in Margaret's back somehow migrated to her stomach where she felt a deep twinge of despair. It didn't bother her that Hazey made more money than she and Hank would see in a lifetime. But couldn't she have a 5% raise and good medical insurance?

She let herself in the house. No simple key for Dr. Hazey. His code for the alarmed entry was 1988. "Something special about that year?" Margaret had asked. It surprised her when he said it was the anniversary of starting Inner Horizons. She hadn't realized he cared.

She keyed in the entry code to the alarm system. 1988. The year Hazey had started Inner Horizons, he told her, when he gave her the code. She was surprised he cared. Hazey was famous for referring to Inner Horizons as either an albatross around his neck or a vampire that was stealing his blood.

Hazey was known to call Inner Horizons an albatross around his neck or when he was in a bad mood, a vampire that sucked his blood. This was rich given the impression Margaret got when she opened the door.

Inside, the place wasn't exactly a mess, It was obvious Hazey employed a house cleaner. It had just been a while between cleanings. A month after Christmas, water-starved poinsettias on the dining table raised weak spindly arms to the sun and dropped withered leaves on the black varnish. Muddy boot tracks marred the entry parquet. In the master bath, which took her a while to locate, a ring of soap scum circled the black whirlpool bath. When Margaret took a pee, she resolutely refused to look in the toilet bowl. Some things you just didn't want to know about your employer.

Margaret counted nine grapenuts-encrusted cereal bowls in the sink. The housekeeper must coming at the end of the week. When she looked in the fridg, other than a carton of 1% milk and four bottles of Roederer champagne, there was nothing to eat. Margaret's Costco-stocked cupboards and jars of home canned beets and peaches and a freezer half full of Sausage, the pig they had raised and butchered last fall, made her life look pretty full. Did the man eat out every meal except breakfast? What a thin life.

062215 Hazey's Drug Stash Rewrites

It was easy to find Hazey's enormous glass and concrete house. It was the only aggressively contemporary place in a neighborhood of designer log houses that were supposed to look like cabins but were five times larger than the cabin Margaret had grown up in. Hazey's driveway was not only clear of snow but completely dry. Shit and Shinola! Dr. Hazey had a *heated* driveway?

Hazey was known to call Inner Horizons an albatross around his neck or when he was in a bad mood, a vampire that sucked his blood. This was rich given the impression Margaret got when she opened the door.

Wow. Gleaming black wood floors in a glassed in two-story entry. A red and black art rug was repeated in exactly the reverse pattern in a sunken living room that was about the size of Margaret's whole house. If Inner Horizon's was a vampire, quite a bit of blood must have been sucked into building this place.

She'd known in the abstract that Inner Horizons made money. How could they not when each kid was charged \$12000 a month in fees. But this level of luury was unlike anything Margaret had ever wished for. She felt ashamed of wishing for a new garage door. It seemed like poverty of imagination when she should have been wishing for a heated driveway. Toto, we're not in Idaho anymore.

Margaret was not an envious person. In general, she liked her old farm house with its garden in the side yard and her Sexlink chickens she liked to feed by hand and cluck to. She'd like to pay her taxes on time. She'd like to be covered by health insurance. Sure, it would be nice to have a whirlpool bath---wouldn't Hank love that for his aching back---but what really struck her was how lonely Hazey's house looked.

She counted nine cereal bowls encrusted with Grapenuts in the sink. A bowl of grapenuts eaten standing at the sink for every day between house cleaning? There was a sad soap scum around the black tub. A monster to keep clean. Clearly, the man didn't know how to pick up after himself. His king size bed was unmade and musty-smelling. Dirty tee shirts and balled up underwear and a pair of work pyjama bottoms dotted the carpet like droppings of Hazey's life. A certain dishevelment had cropped up in Hazey's dress after Alma's departure with the horse whisperer. A stain on his tie. Shirts that weren't crisply starched and ironed as they'd been on Alma's watch.

It was more information about her boss than Margaret wanted. So much easier to think of her boss as an overspending, luxury-flaunting robot than a lonely, slightly down-at-the-heels man who was unraveling at the seams like his pajamas.

Reaction to Rusty

Margaret shrank back from the kitchen window so she wouldn't be seen. There was something off about Rusty Harrow. Actually, there was something off about all the Harrows, starting with the old man, Stan Harrow, who started the dump that was hidden on the other side of the butte from Healing House back in the fifties. It was about a mile and a half away as the crow flew but five miles by county road.

Stan Harrow beat the crap out of those kids. Three of the Harrow boys were older than Margaret. Rusty was in her class from grade school through whatever year he'd dropped out of high school. She still remembered him coming to school with occasional bruises, and once, a black eye. One day, when she sat behind him in the 8^th^ grade, a trail of dried blood ran down his neck from his ear.

These days, you'd call CPS. Back then, everybody turned a blind eye. What people did at home was their business. No wonder all of Rusty's brothers and the one sister---Olga? Helga? --got the hell out as soon as they could. All except Rusty who'd inexplicably stayed on. Stan had died in a mysterious trailer fire at the dump. After that, Rusty took over the operation and now he picked up trash in unincorporated Couer D'Alene country for people who were willing to pay him under the table. Rusty was still driving the old man's ancient green stake bed truck which had to built in the forties. It was amazing the thing still ran.

She'd seen Rusty making trash pick-ups at all six of the Inner Horizons facilities. Hazey must have contracted with Rusty to add home pick-up to his bill. He probably buried his personal trash fees in the Inner Horizons business bill. One more reason bosses made money and people like Margaret paid for it.

Margaret and Hank still took their trash to the dump, another cash-and-carry place. These days, Margaret made Hank do dump duty, though she loaded up the trash barrels every couple of months. She didn't like the dead-eyed way Rusty stared at her. Didn't want to imagine how messed up and crazy he was after being practically raised by hyenas.

Margaret was so shaken by her discovery of Hazey's drug stash, she completely forgot the shoe she'd been sent for.

She remembered it as she left the gated entry way Couer D'Alene Heights---yet another security code to punch in---and she had to wheel around the bare driveway in the Lexus and retrace her steps to the kitchen. She walked in without boots, at the end of January---hell, she could have gone in her socks---and retrieved the size 13 Triple EEE wingtip on the counter.

For no other reason that she was a good employee and any neglect bothered her, she emptied the teapot into the sad poinsettias. She quick-rinsed the Grape-nut bowls and loaded them in the dishwasher. Hazey was crazy as a loon, but for good or ill, he was her loon, she supposed.

On her way out of the front door, she spotted a coil of sausage skin and an empty beer can from the steps where Rusty Harrow had enjoyed his lunch. Was it her lot in life to be surrounded by crazies? What in the world was she going to do about it?

She signed and threw the trash in her purse. It would serve Hazey right if beer dripped on his shoe leather.

062315 Margaret is torn

She liked her old farmhouse with the linoleum that needed to be replaced. She liked her Sexlink chickens and she really liked feeding them by hand and clucking to them like some Giant Mother Hen though who the hell knew if the dim birds even recognized her. All she wanted was health insurance. A living wage. Having a heated driveway was so far off her list of wants that she was ashamed of herself for mooning about having an electric garage opener.

Margaret was so shaken by the discovery of Hazey's private Pleasure Chest, she forgot the damn shoe she'd been sent for. She remembered it as she exited the gated community with the sign that said Kootenai Reserve. Reserved for everybody but Kootenai Indians, they meant.

This time, when she came in the glass entry, she was struck by the glistening of cobwebs in the high corners. The sad poinsettias with their withered leaves looked even more neglected.

The shoe was where she left it on the kitchen counter. Size 13 Triple EEE Brooks Brothers. A hole was beginning to wear through the sole. That would drive Hazey, who cared about being well dressed, bats.

On her way out, the poinsettias on the dining table seemed to be reaching out t her. She was feeling guilty about her feelings of envy. Really, she wasn't a jealous person. She was a good person. A great employee. One who cared about the kids and wanted to help them through their suffering.

The next thing she knew, she was wiping up the scattered leaves. She emptied the teapot giving all the pots a drink. When she dumped the leaves in the trash under the sink, an image of lonely Dr. Hazey eating lonely Grapenuts at the kitchen sink in holey wingtips sucked the green envy right out of her and she loaded all the lonely bowls in the dishwasher.

Dr. Hazey was crazy as a loon, she supposed, but he was her loon. Now what in creation wash she going to do about it? Leverage. She needed some leverage to get Hazey to do the right thing.

Oh criminently. Right in the middle of the goddamn front steps where Rusty Harrow had enjoyed his mid-morning snack, she found a coil of salami skin like a snake. An empty beer can. Unwilling to go through the whole rigamarole with de-arming and re-arming the security code again, she threw the trash in her purse with the wingtip. Serve Hazy right if Rusty's beer can dripped on the leather.

The house felt even larger and lonelier her second time through. Cobwebs glistened in the high glass corners. The poinsettias spindly arms seemed to reach out to her for help. It was plenty warm in the house---Hazey apparently didn't care about saving money by turning the heat down when he was gone---but it felt cold. White caps skimmed off the deep and dark part of the lake that wasn't frozen over.

070725 Dr. Hazey Reassures Lydia's Mother

After Alma, his ex-wife ran off with the horse whisperer, Dr. Aloysius Hazey, watched Lake Coeur D'Alene freeze and re-freeze from the comfort of his office. Many hours of the day, he found it impossible to do anything productive. A stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical health care premiums needed a review. A performance review for Darlene, the earnest but by-the-book head therapist, remained unread. Unsigned.

He checked the wall clock again. Another hour before he could reasonably down a second muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his shoulders, during the check-in with Lydia's mother. He could down the pill right after his session with OG, but not before.

Today's number one priority was to assure Rahel Bronfman nee .... (He couldn't remember her new married name) about Lydia's progress. The news frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. She had six write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct; Axel was unlucky number seven.

Her file was a creative confabulation of carefully coded phrases of dysfunction: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (I.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to initiate sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening but still nascent (keeping her under lock-and-key was working as long as she didn't try to escape). "

What Dr. Hazey could say definitively about Lydia Bronffman was that her \$18,000 --a-month fees were always on time.

Parents like Lydia's mother wanted to meet with Dr. Hazey, the Founder and Psychiatric Director of Inner Horizons, to be reassured of their children's progress. He'd tried fruitlessly to pass this duty off to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene had no idea how to be generic while reassuring. She had a problem with brutal honesty. Parents would meet with Darlene, of the dour, sour and truthful pronouncements, and there went another monthly fee transferred away to the new Anorexia Unit at Harvard's McLain Hospital or Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu. God, it was dog-eat-dog in the depression-and- anxieties-world.

Hazey's personal trick was to hit the right balance between avuncular "give it time" pronouncements while avoiding the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for maturity and self-knowledge when in fact, almost every adolescent who got stuck had a common habit of sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January. She just wasn't any better.

Rahel Bronfman turned out to be Rahel Bronfman nee Hunt. -a Lot. She was a martially thin, dark-haired woman. A perfect clone of her daughter, or, he supposed, vice versa. Lydia was tiny too but rounded in a childlike way while her mother was tight and lean. A workout regime tougher than the Marine's had toned her wiry body without an ounce of softness. Calves like ropy knots rose above excellent ankles and narrow hips.

Rahel's first question was whether her daughter was gaining any weight.

"She has a tendency to fat, like I do." The buttock she caressed was flat as a coyote's. It was not hard to see where Lydia got her obsession with food, though the woman was legally attractive. When she laid a hand on his arm---he'd made the mistake of sitting with her on the couch---he felt like a cream puff dangerously close to her teeth. "Help my little girl," she murmured. "Lydia's all I have."

Hazey at first tried to probe why Rahel failed almost weekly to call in to Lydia's family therapy. She just waved airil, saying, "I've been out of the country" as if cell phones and WhatsApp didn\'t exist.

He tried again. "Kids feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their well-being,."

"I'm a good mother!" she barked. "What did she say about me?"

Hazey quickly deflected the danger to his fees, saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfman---your father?--- is the father figure in Lydia's life." The lifelong issue between absent mother and angry daughter wasn't going to get solved in 45-minute fly-by in the family jet. "Lydia is happy you are here," he said. "Just don't be surprised if she acts out."

"Of course," Rahel stroked his hand as if she was checking for plumpness.

Thank the lucky stars, Darlene had been able to convince Lydia to meet with her mother, even though it had taken a marathon of extra therapy sessions and some fierce negotiation and bribery. Lydia wanted to take classes at Northern Idaho Community College, though she was nowhere near ready for a pass to NICC in the free world. The girl was a danger to herself and others.

Rahel's exit in a rat-a-tat-tat of spike heels jackhammered at Hazey's overloaded brain. God, he needed that muscle relaxant that was calling out to him like a siren deep in his pocket. He absolutely couldn't. Only when the woman was safely back on her Learjet --- then, and only then---could he allay the siren's call with a splash of Bombay and tonic.

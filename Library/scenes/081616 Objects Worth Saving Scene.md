081616 Objects Worth Saving Scene

Reza had grabbed his pillow.

"What?" he said to the cat calls. "It takes forever to break one in."

Lydia thought about the first two weeks of hardship on the National Park hike. She didn't have a pillow. As in most things, Lydia had expected someone else to provide life's necessities and some hurried maid had forgotten to pack one. Between the adrenalin ache in her legs and the strangeness of sleeping outdoors with her head in downward slope, she didn't sleep for the first week. Gracie, finally took pity on her and loaned her the leader's personal pillow. No wonder she fell in love!

Rachel's choice was a photo album. Lydia had seen the way she wrapped her arms around it like she was holding a baby to her chest. She tucked her sketchbook in the back of her pants and tied the windbreaker Charlene shoved at her around her waist.

"It's the only thing I can't replace," Rachel said when Darlene asked her why she chose the album. Rachel's desk was covered with photos of her family while Old Girl's was blank as a desert. She felt her sketches of sub alpine flowers were irreplaceable too, when she thought of her old self cross-legged on the screen, hunched over its pages with colored pencils and the fine ink pen she'd used to draw in the outlines and work the cross hatching. The sketches went everywhere with her. Whenever everybody else took a rest break, she yanked out the leather journal and worked on them.

Gracie was working on a research project tracking the effects of climate change on the interaction of flower pollination by bees. Lydia had never really under the study; all she cared about was the way Gracie had studied her drawings and praised the loving details and increasing sophistication. "How long have you been drawing?" she had asked and Lydia was too afraid to tell her she'd just started. The maid who had forgotten the pillow had packed the leather-bound blank paged journal and an assortment of colored pencils and water brush pens. The minute she put started looking closely at the plants, she had a sudden desire to put pencil to paper, as if something clicked into place.

Was it Gracie's admiration and praise? Or simply the way time expanded when she was translating what she saw into sepals and stamens and anthers and pistols and petals on the page. From her early stumbling starts, she could see her progress through the days and weeks of the tour on the pages of the journal, almost as if her eyes saw more detail and her fingers got more dexterous as her knees and hips and feet strengthened on the trail.

"Lydia, stop lollygagging." Darlene's voice cut through her reminisces. "Here," she said, but she wasn't. Not really. She was high on Windy Pass in the North Cascades, trying to capture a strange plant that looked like a wooky on a thin, swaying stalk. She couldn't remember a time when she had been so still, so content to be in her body and not worrying about what she could or could not eat, or wondering who was looking at her or what she could get out of them. On the hiking tour, you ate what they gave you or you went hungry. You slept when the sun went down. Sat when the leader called a halt. Did chores like everybody else. And somehow all her inner chattering, all the anxieties of what she looked like, what she wore, who liked her or hated her, disappeared for a few months. It was a walking bubble of existence where time was always in the present. The people on the trail with her were wearing the same clothes, smelling of the same acrid sweat, eating the same granola and freeze dried meals. They even dumped on the same schedule with what was was euphemistically called "the whole food diet." And for all five hundred miles they tramped, it was enough.

Irreplaceable? Essential as breathing, was how Lydia thought of the sketch book created during the one time in her life when she was in her body and actually okay with it.

A photo album, a lucky rabbit's foot, a balled up ragbag of tatters that turned out to be Big Paul's ancient baby blanket. When Big Paul pulled it out, no one could figure out what it was --"Rags?" "everyone was too intimidated to laugh. Baseball cards (those were James), a smooth white rock with a yellow sun, a knitted baby hat with black beagle ears. None of what they had grabbed at the last instant when the fire alarm went off had any value except the value the each brought to the thing. It was like all the objects, worthless in themselves, spoke to whatever each of them wanted to save of themselves.

"Well, something to think about!" Darlene said in her Pollyanna voice. "What's important at the last second isn't clothes or money or the latest technology, is it?"

Big Paul said, "We don't have the latest technology. You took it away from us."

"Yes, but you get the idea."

Darlene started the session buy asking each of them to get whatever they had saved from the fire when they thought Healing House was going to go up in flames.

Lydia had never showed her drawings to anyone, except Gracie, the tour leader. They were too private, too special and mysterious---where had they come from?\-- to share with anyone. She couldn't articulate their value, even to herself. She had gone to her room and taken the small leather book out of the trunk where it was hidden feeling vaguely suspicious. There was always a trick at Process Group, some trap to get you to reveal yourself if you weren't careful. She was a little cold, so she slipped on her Ferragamo Boots and went back to the living room.

By the time she got there, a motley assortment of crap was collected on a prayer rug in the center of the carpetl Rachel's photo album, a small carved rabbit, a pillow, some letters on lined paper, a high school letter jacket, a handknit sweater, and some pile of tattered rags that looked like an macrame' project gone wrong.

The idea was that everyone had to show the thing they had saved from the fire. "What if you didn't save anything?" Danny asked. "I saved myself." If that didn't say everything there was to say about Danny, Lydia didn't know what would.

Darlene said they were supposed to pick what they would have saved if they'd been thinking and then explain what it meant to them.

"Where's yours, Lydia?" Darlene asked when she noticed that her hands were empty.

Oh holy hell, no. No you don't, Lydia thought. The sketchbook was tucked in the armpit so she could lug the big sit-pillow from her room to lean it up against the couch. She kept the journal close to her body and hopped, first on one leg, then the other, so she could pull off the tight fitting boots.

"Ferragamos!" She held up the knee length black leather boot and dumped it on top of the pile. "Brand new."

"OK, who hasn't got an object to talk about?"

Luckily Darlene hadn't been keeping track of people when they brought their show-and-tell item. Lydia's sketchbook was tucked up against her body in her armpit while both hands were occupied with a large sit-pillow she'd brought to lean against the couch. Niggardly Healing House. Where there were never enough chairs.

"Is that what you saved from your room?" Darlene nodded at the pillow covered with a Guatemalan knock-off illustration of two people having dog sex.

Lydia dropped the pillow, then hopped around on one leg, then the other, while she pulled off her boots and managed to sit down without falling. "This is what I saved," she said. "Ferragamos. \$1200."

"Is that for one or for two?" Danny wanted to know.

Everybody else groaned.

"What," Lydia said. "Half of you assholes ran out in bare feet."

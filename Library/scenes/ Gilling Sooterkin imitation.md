Gilling Imitation

The Reverend Mr. Kidney is a short round bowlegged man with

black muttonchop whiskers and a florid face, like a

pomegranate, into which he has poured a great quantity of

brandy and lesser amounts of whisky and claret.

\--Tom Gilling, \[1\]The Sooterkin

Frankie O was a small thin dope dealer with red weeping acne, like road rash, which he\'d picked at and played with until new scars formed over old scars and turned his face livid.

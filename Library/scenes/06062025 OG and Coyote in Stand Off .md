06062025 OG and Coyote in Stand Off

She and the coyote seemed to be at a stand-off, until OG remembered the Darlene's almost-empty Cheeto bag she'd stuffed in her coat pocket back at Healing House.

The coyote was now lying down on the road, its pink teats distended and thin from feeding her kits. Her incisors were firmly embedded in the back pack strap, as if she wasn't about to let it go without a fight to the death. OG thought about what to do for a long minute, then pulled off a glove as yellow eyes watched her. One ear turned towards the sound of crinkling as she teased the bag out of her pocket with cold fingers.

First, she tried under handing a cheese curl between the coyote's paws which made the creature lift off vertically and hop backwards a foot. Moonlight caught the cut of yellow eyes toward the puff, but after that, the coyote refused to look at any or the orange curls OG launched. It fixed its predator's gaze on her own.

"They're good." OG tried for a conversational tone. "Charlene thinks so. She's the reason I don't have that many left."

She tossed a fourth curl, this one landing sailing in front of its quivering nose. The coyote regally ignored it. A sphinx-like gaze focused on her as if she had the patience of eternity.

She was seven or eight Cheeto tosses along, before OG became aware of a distant engine coming from the direction of Inner Horizons.

The blue night was cold but not unbearable now that she was moving. Moonlight silvered the road where the coyote crouched, one ear cocked to the new sound. Clinks and rattles accompanied a low rumble of an unmuffled engine. It sounded as if the vehicle was laboring up the icy hill she had just climbed over and had tiptoed her way down wishing she had metal spikes.

A glow like a dawn rose at the crest of he hill. The rumble deepened as empty yellow eyes emerged from the glow and resolved into headlights. A downshift of the sound would have made sense to her if the lights slowed down but weirdly they seemed to speed up as they came closer.

The coyote was leaping over the snow berm, before she got her own feet to move. It loped toward the tall Ponderosas that lined south side of the road before made a 90 degree turn to the west.

She was off the hard packed ice, trying to climb over the broken and jagged snow deposits piled up by a season of snow plows to her chest. A dark mass whizzed past her, so close that if she'd winged her elbow it would have been shaved off at her arm pit. A frigid gust lifted her ear flaps over head as a truck loaded down in the back with jingling and jangling noise lifted over the berm as if it lcould fl. She caught a glimpse of all fourr wheels spinning in the air Gold lit a glimpse of caramel-colored tree bark.

SHHHhh-WANNGGGG!

A bomb-like exploding sound might have been the engine block meeting the base of the tree.

A simultaneous CRAAAACCCCKKK accompanied the cleaving sound of an eighty-foot treat splitting down to its the heartwood.

Only years later would she be able could turn off the vision of the mad truck continuing its mad drive upward--- perpendicular to the ground!---before gravity finally slipped its grip and allowed the undercarriage of the vehicle to slip slowly sideways supported by the part of the tree still standing.

THWWWWUMPPP.

An avalanche of heavy snow from the upper branches buried the truck, the tree trunk and its presumably its driver in a flurry of white.

The last thing OG did, after climbing up and over the berm, was to unwrap the ham-and-cheese sandwich Margaret had left for her lunch. She opened the sandwich and laid a slice of cheese glistening with mayonnaise next to the other side that was piled with mustard and ham. It was protected with Margaret's saran wrap, so hopefully the mother coyote, wherever it was lurking in the trees would smell the dinner that would feed its kits.

The driver of the garbage truck was gone. Life went on. The hard lesson she learned at Inner Horizons and would relearn at many points of her life went on.

"I wouldn't feed Cheetos to my kids either."

"So how come you're eating them?"

"Kids are still growing. I figure I'm too old to worry about it." Margaret's moving hands and the focused look on her kindly face came to OG just as she tossed a cheese curl iin the air and caught it with her mouth like a piece of popcorn. "There you go, honey," she said, dusting orange dusty off her hands. "Eat it late on when you're hungry.'

PRADA PURSE. CHECK. FERRAGAMO BOOTS. Check. Desire the One perfume. Check. Lydia went through the stuff she had with her one by one. Rag & Bone jeans. Milly blouse. Extra-large bottle of Listerine.

Empty. Empty. Empty. All Lydia could think after meeting with her mother was how much she wanted to stuff her face. Size zero. Size zero. She'd been a size zero since she was a twelve-year-old over and if she repeated it enough, maybe it would stop her from going in to the Dunkin\' Donuts store on the corner of Desiree' Street, four blocks away from Northern Idaho Community College, where she was supposed to be in World History class.

At the counter, multi-colored sprinkles and rich dark chocolate frosting and cinnamon sugar on cake donuts promised fat and fullness.

She took the pink box with 13 donuts from the nice Mennonite waitress ---"13 is for luck and Lydia!" the girl said, surprising Lydia by knowing her name. Shit. Had she been to Dunkin' Donuts so often they recognized her?

She went behind the store to the narrow space between two reeking blue dumpsters. If she pulled her knees up, her boot tips didn\'t show and she felt invisible. Out of sight, out of mind, she thought as she ate three cake donuts dipped in cinnamon sugar first, then the powdered sugar ones; then she started in on the chocolate frosted glazed donuts and stuffed them down quickly, barely chewing. From years of experience she knew she had to bolt them down as fast as she could before the gluey mass formed in her stomach and kept her from finishing the box. She got through all twelve before lucky Number 13 started her gag reflex, helped along by a practiced finger at the back of her throat.

Not wanting to mess up her boots, she had to hold the heavy dumpster lid up over her head and because she was short---what her Jewish grandfather called petite, but he was only 5 foot-six, so what did he know? ----it was hard to get her lips up and past the edge of rusted metal. Twice she had to lower the lid and rest her forehead against the cold, blue side of the bin. Back to work, she\'d think, every time she raised the lid and tried to stand on her tiptoes to hurl her own foulness above the reek. When she got lightheaded and dizzy, she finally gave up on trying to protect her Ferragamos. She went back to the cozy, half-hidden place between the dumpsters and retched out the whole foul baker's dozen in a fiesta of pink and green-flecked confetti and half-masticated dough.

It took maybe 30 minutes for her to finally feel empty and clean as a bell.

She took a packet of baby wipes out of the Prada and wiped the flecks of candied sprinkles and chocolate goo and spit off her toes. A half-dozen gargles of Listerine. One last cleansing spit.

The size 0 waist of the Rag & Bone jeans gapped nicely. Fuck James, she thought, deciding to torment him by giving Reza a hand job in the back of the van.

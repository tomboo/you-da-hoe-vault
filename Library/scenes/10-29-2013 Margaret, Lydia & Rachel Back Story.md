Margaret, Lydia & Rachel Back Story

Jackson is the continuous character in all of Atkinson\'s stories. That makes sense because he\'s the detective and the one most responsible for solving the crime. All the other characters interact with and revolve around him.

He\'s also the moral center, the character who is most its moral center. At heart, he\'s a simple man who believes in duty and loyalty and defeating the bad guys although he\'s willing to bend or even break a few rules to do it.

The character most like Jackson in my story is Margaret. How do you make a 50-year-old housewife who\'s already raised her kids the moral center? Without formal education, it\'s the school of hard knocks that has educated Margaret. She\'s all about family but her definition of family is a capacious tent. All are welcome as long as you make an effort and don\'t shit where you eat. She\'s full of those Montana sayings like, \"Shut your pie hole,\" and she has a recipe for Meedsville beets and she\'s a non-therapist\'s therapist for the kids \_\_\_\_ with common sense and love and not much of monetary value except her beat up dog haired Subaru. Lloyd is laid up with a bad back and Margaret is sex-starved because there\'s no jumping each other with Lloyd groaning and flinching when he tries to sit. \"Maybe we should do it in the Lazy Boy,\" she thinks, imagining straddling Lloyd\'s capacious belly and bringing herself against the arm rests. \"Better get rid of Aunt Lucille\'s doilies or they\'ll gum up the works in the chair.\" There was a time when Margaret had a rack that would make Lloyd stand at attention better than a gun rack. Her ass now broad as a barn and twice as red is covered by a big shirt that has a big NRA logo on it logo \_\_\_ says support the right to bear arms / look up funny NRA saying.

Margaret wants a full time job as the cook with benefits and she figures out that Hazey is using the kids\' drugs for his own private Idaho. She blackmails \-- in a nice way! \-- Hazy into letting her replace the registered dietician by promising to go to North Idaho Community College to get her dieticians license but he has to pay her the old dietician\'s salary while she\'s going to school.

Margaret could use common sense to help the kids she sees struggling.

She keeps her eyes open and her trap shut. Her kids thought she had eyes in the back of her head but really Margaret thinks like a kid recognizing the need to pull the wool over the adults eyes and the desire to do what she wants even though you\'re underage and stupid.

She knows Lydia\'s been fucking James for cigarettes. The girl\'s underwear always smells of sex and she\'s found enough gummy socks in the laundry to cure her of touching them with her bare hands which is why she wears purple gloves around the house and always has a pair hanging out of her back pocket like a change of panties.

How could she help Lydia. She endears herself to Rachel by slipping her a calling card with a few bucks on it that one of the kids who left the program forgot in a drawer. That allows homesick Rachel to call home.

What does Lydia want? She wants to be thin so she\'s always throwing up. Margaret brings in kohlrabi from her garden and convinces Lydia to try one and the girl is surprised by the green apple taste and \_\_\_\_\_ eats something good for her. Margaret feels like she\'s won the Powerball Lottery when she sees the skinny girl swallow. Yes! There is a God! she thinks without a twitch of her joy on her face. Maybe she\_\_\_\_ her food stash by following Lydia out to the woodpile. She doesn\'t report her but she makes her eat an apple and a chunk of rat cheese even though Lydia looks murderous at taking in the calories. She makes Lydia fold laundry that she calls Mt. Rushmore for a couple hours so she can\'t put her finger down her throat and throw it up.

Rachel Back Story

Rachel is an epileptic and she wants to die of embarrassment when she has a fit during her first appearance at Group. But why is she in the treatment program? She\'s depressed and she\'s tried to kill herself but she\'s nothing like Old Girl in her pursuit of death. If Old Girl\'s pursuit of death is like a trip to Timbuktu, Old Girl has landed at the airport and is in a taxi that will take her into town. Rachel hasn\'t even bought the travel book for the trip, much less the airline ticket.

Has Rachel had a baby that her parents took away from her and that is what cascaded her into the downward spiral that landed her in treatment? She still dreams about a baby calling to her. It is crying in a room she is always searching for and can\'t find. She has to tell James about how she lost her baby by letting the nurse take it out of her, \_\_\_\_\_\_ and succumbing to the overwhelming tiredness that drew her head under the waves of sleep. \"They drugged you!\" James said. His hand found hers and it felt warm and solid, something secure to hold onto. \"No,\" she shook her head vehemently. \"I was just tired and I fell asleep.\" \"Jesus Christ, you just had a baby. My mom\'s an obstetrician. She says it\'s like running a marathon. Why wouldn\'t you be tired.\"

No, she thinks, if I had been stronger \-- a mother has the strength of a tiger \-- I would have held on.

\"Have you ever had Atavan?\" he asked.

\"I don\'t know. No. I don\'t think so.\" The name \_\_\_ a distant sell. A voice above her right shoulder, her legs still in the stirrups protected by the drape. \"It\'ll just help you relax,\" the voice said and she seemed to remember somebody else asking how much and the voice again. \"A 2 with push with Atavan and its \_\_\_\_\_.

Margaret:

When Lloyd was seeing double, Margaret told him, \"If my butt is looking bigger, it\'s only the drugs.\"

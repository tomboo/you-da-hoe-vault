111314 Winter Setting

February 29. Leap year.

Frosty. Stars bright as cut diamonds scattered on black velvet. Old Girl strode away from Healing House, the cold carving her breath from her lungs like a knife.

Bullying

Late afternoon. Cyanide hour. Most of the residents sprawled around the living area like refugees from a war. Couch cushions were upended on the carpet like orange eruptions. Magazines tossed in a corner. A half full laundry basket had socks lining its edge like white tongues.

What was it about people at Healing House that made them occupy space like an invading army?

Old Girl wasn't the only one who wanted to poke a stick in every eye. If only Darlene wasn't watching. And truth be told, she would have started with stupid Esty.

Old Girl felt a rumble in her stomach like distant thunder. Lunch had been inedible. And the dinner was equally suckitude: gray peas and gray meat loaf and gravy that could have been mistaken for motor oil. And now with Reza getting stabbed, dessert was officially off the table. Jesus. Weren't these people legally obligated to feed teenagers something they could actually swallow?

The sounds of Reza's sniffles were like distant music. Old Girl stacked up a bunch of dinner plates from the table and hip-bumped her way into the kitchen. She intended to dump them on the counter --it wasn't her day for dish duty---and she was startled to see Danny standing at the kitchen counter. She was bent over a lemon meringue pie and lapping at it like a dog.

"What the hell?"

Danny's head bobbed up. A yellow gout of neon yellow clung to one cheek bone. "It's my pie," she said. "For graduating early."

"You didn't graduate. You manipulated your way out of here."

"So?"

"So sve some dessert for the rest of us."

A cluster-fuck of a day. Both Healing House vans in the shop. Classes cancelled---in Idaho for God's sake!---because of the blizzard that dumped three feet of snow over night. Old Girl felt like she'd been locked up for a week and it wasn't even time for dinner.

The living area looked like it had been occupied by those occupiers. All three couches claimed by hostile takeover. Parcheesi parts all over the rug. A deck of cards littered the coffee table. Darlene had put a stop to all the games because there was too much fighting.

It was a big room though it felt cramped and claustrophobic with a dozen people doing that thing she'd seen on the Nature channel: everybody was making themselves big and taking up space in order to make their enemies feel smaller. It worked with gorillas. Why not crazy people?

Princess Danny and her posse, for example, occupied most of the plaid couch. She'd squished weaselly Rezza into the corner while she laid out in state like Queen Nefertiti. True, Danny was about 6' tall. She played volleyball forward when she wasn't locked up in the nut house.

Old Girl was so hungry, she thought about eating cardboard.

Old Girl was starving. Lunch had been some inedible stew thing with floating chunks of unidentifiable meat parts. She swore an ear had landed in her bowl and once the idea got lodged in her mind, she had to excuse herself from the table and run to the bath room.

Snack had been limp celery and carrot stubs that were slightly greasy with age. Maybe she was getting the flu. Was that why she felt like a yawning hole had opened up in her stomach that would never be filled?

Classes had been cancelled so they'd been stuck in the living room all day. Three feet of snow had dumped over half the state in twenty-four hours and even in Idaho, with one snow plow for every other car, they couldn't keep the roads clear.

If a stranger had walked into Healing House, it would have seemed like those Wall Street occupier had moved to Idaho. Every available couch and chair, all the flat surfaces, the shag rug, even the area under the coffee table had been colonized by somebody staking their claim

The living room of Healing House looked like it had been occupied by a ragtag bunch of those Wall Street occupiers. The ones who had more rage than ideas and didn't give a shit how much mess they made for somebody else to clean up.

Everybody had spread out, colonizing as much space as possible with personal crap. Blankets, somebody's laundry basket, peechee folders, text books, and every game from the Game Room: Parcheesi and checkers and Chinese checkers and Twister and Monopoly and cribbage and Risk. Tiny tokens littered the rug and people were constantly complaining when they stepped on them. They'd played each one for a few minutes, then abandoned each game for some other one that was supposedly more fun until everybody agreed they all sucked.

Outside, snow fell in leaden, never ending streams that had piled up three feet over night and showed no signs of stopping. The van couldn't get out of the driveway. Margaret had tried to drive onto the main road over the snow berm left by an early morning snow plow and now the old beast was high centered on a collar of ice and drift. The people who thought they were going to class at NICC all had to climb out and trudge back inside shrouded in white before they reached the door.

At first, people were excited that they got a snow day. No school---yippee!\--was the general feeling but after an hour or two dealing with every mental disorder in the DSM became reality, they changed their tune.

By late afternoon---or what Old Girl remembered her mom calling Cyanide Hour---people were sick of holding it together. Plus Old Girl was starving because lunch had been some kind of inedible stew thing that Rezza said was possum.

There was no sunset. The dim snow-gray afternoon dulled into darkness and though every lamp was turned on, the light was too feeble to cast into the shadows and the curtain of snow drew even closer.

No sunset. No separation between the dull dim gray afternoon light and the dim dull darkness of nightfall. The lamps, even on high, failed to penetrate the shadows.

By day's end, the living area looked like it had been occupied by that ragtag band that had taken over Wall Street in the news. All the couches were cattywampus, shoved out of their regular places by the cliques that were composed of opposing factions. There was Danny and her gang of cutthroats and weasels on the plaid couch and ottomans. Old Girl and Rachel and James had the flowered couch. ADD Paul and the new Korean kid who was his roommate camped on the leather love seat with the split cushion that was vomiting stuffing. Darlene had said it was off limits but relented when Paul said it wasn't fair to make them sit on the floor all fucking day.

People kept complaining that it was cold. Everybody dragged bedding from their rooms into the living area and now it looked like a large encampment of nomads. "Bedouins unit!" Rezza had called out when he and Danny and Mean Priscilla had arrived with matching Pendleton blankens wrapped around their shoulders. "Sheik! Sheik! Sheik it!" he sand while doing a gross approximation of what a New Jersey prep school kid thought was a belly dance.

Each group made a game of colonizing every available flat space near their couch. Apparently the Bedouins weren't supposed to sit on the couch cushions since they were needed to sleep on the ground.

Adding to the mess was every conceivable game board dragged from the Game Room. Monopoly, Parcheesi, Chinese Checkers, cribbage, Risk, even an old Candy Cane Lane Game that Old Girl had played in third grade were all laid out between the fiefdoms like pathways. The bords demarcated one clique's territory from another's.

At one point in the afternoon, Margaret walked by and rolled her eyes at the mess. "This better be straightened up by dinner time or you're all going to be written up," she said.

"If you write all ten of us up, doesn't that make everybody equally bad?" asked Danny.

Margaret ignored her. She disappeared into the kitchen and a few minutes later, it sounded like she was beating the shit out of something with a rolling pin.

Old Girl's stomach had been growling since lunch. Meatloaf sandwiches of some kind of mystery meat and catsup had just about made her hurl. She slipped James \$5 bucks---her whole allowance---for a Baby Ruth but it barely lasted an hour.

By 3 pm, it felt like her stomach was an empty mouth calling to be fed.

No wonder she wanted to put a stick in everybody's eye.

Lunch sucked worse than usual. It was some kind of mystery stew thing where the meat was a mystery---Rezza said it was possum---and Danny swore she recognized an ear.

Old Girl had abandoned her bowl after one bite, then paid James \$5 for a Baby Ruth bar that filled her up for maybe half an hour, then left her even emptier than before.

Outside, snow fell like a never-ending curtain.

When Old Girl saw the sharp serving fork fall to the floor, she heard herself saying, "Do some thing. No one is going to do it for you!"

But the second the words left her mouth, she realized the futility of her statement. Esty couldn't do anything against Danny or Reza. She was scared of them. Even Priscilla, the weakest of the bunch, had her cowed. If she was going to feed herself, Old Girl would have to help her.

"Wait." She held up her hand, then bent and retrieved the big fork from the floor. She held it out handle first, letting her thumb press against the pointed tines with enough pressure to draw a line of blood into the whorls of her skin. Esty's eyes narrowed slightly. "Go ahead. Feed yourself," Old Girl said.

Esty took all the time in the world. She leaned across the table, half-standing, looking like she was going to stab a piece of meat loaf from the platter next to Rezza's hand. The tines came down in the meaty part of Rezza's hand, between his thumb and forefinger, and when he screamed, trying to stand and back away at the same moment, Esty lunged and threw her considerable bulk over his forearm to embed it deeper into the table top.

Esty held onto the fork with both hands, while Darlene and Danny yanked at her, trying to pull her away from Rezza. She was looking in Old Girl's eyes when she gave the barely perceptible head bob of a dog with a meaty bone. Not letting go of this one.

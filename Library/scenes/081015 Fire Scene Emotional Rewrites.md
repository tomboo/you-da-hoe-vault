081015 Fire Scene Emotional Rewrites

Old Girl had already pared down her life to the bare essentials. Gabe's hat. A Hello Kitty backpack. Her journal. To lose Snoopy was like having one of her arm amputated and then being expected to carry on without anaesthesia.

Her immediate impulse was to throw herself into the middle of their blankets and howl. Her feet were moving toward the James-Rachel-Lydia cocoon before the thought-no, the need for warmth, was full formed. Somebody hold me. Hold me before I fall down on my knees.

Rachel was surprised by the light touch of James's hand on her shoulder. When he opened the folds of the blankets, she backed into him without even thinking about the rightness of sharing body heat. There was nothing sexual about feeling the lean, wiry boyishness of her friend; he smelled like shampoo with a light touch of athletic sweat that reminded her of her little brother Sammy's room back home.

Lydia wandered past in a pink hoody and sleep shorts and the similarity between her and Sammy was uncanny. They were about the same size---like two underfed middle-schoolers with wild mops of black curly hair. In a pair of frog-printed sleep shorts and Ugg boots, Lydia's legs were as goose-bumped and knobby as Sammy's used to be when he'd watch cartoons in his Batman underpants.

She instinctively opened her arms and beckoned at Lydia to come beneath the blanket. The look on Lydia's face! almost naked with desire and fearful she would be denied. "Come in and warm up," Rachel said. "Join the party."

She felt James's small intake of breath and silent laughter. Then he opened his arms and resettled the bedding around both Rachel and Lydia. Because James and Rachel were a head taller than Lydia, she slipped into the nest of their arms like an infant.

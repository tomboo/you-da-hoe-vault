120718 Lydia encounters the cat

The cougar's indifferent eyes swept over her. His mouth was full of bloody rabbit clamped between razor sharp teeth.

She wasn't afraid at all. The cat wasn't interested in her. It had already hunted and killed its prey. It trotted away down the road in the direction she had just come. It was going deeper into the wilderness back to a warm winter den.

It was the thought of the den that got Lydia looking at the Douglas firs and Ponderosas lining the road. Creatures sometimes bedded down in the tree wells, Gracie, her old guide had told her a million years ago. Especially if the snow was deep. Piled snow in the wells of trees insulated the ground and would keep an animal warm. Another of nature's survival strategies.

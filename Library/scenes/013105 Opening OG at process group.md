Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy with only the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

While ten people in their late teens and early twenties straggled into the living room of Healing House--- the "Young Adults" locked up with Old Girl at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment center in Couer D'Alene, Idaho --- she moved her an ottoman away from the irregular circle of beat-up couches set up for Process Group. Next to her on the wall, there were all kinds of portraits of old time people who all looked down at you with withering stares. Old Girl suspected that people who had to sweep the streets with a hand made broom or carried hundreds of pounds of bricks on their shoulders would not have much sympathy for the whining and rationalizing and griping and blaming and circle-jerking that went on three times a week, Monday-Wednesday-Friday, from 10-11 AM.

She turned away from her peers to contemplate a three-foot long icicle spear. It had started forming on the eaves of Healing House weeks ago. Now it was the largest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth . If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

Outside, snow continued to fall. A never-ending curtain of gloom lit by a weak sun that oozed sulfurous yellow light. The wall of fat flakes hid the meadow that usually stretched to the blue foot hills of the Bitterroot Mountains. Idaho winter. Where it started snowing in October and was apparently going to keep on snowing until May.

Darlene, the pinch-faced and humorless Head Therapist, called Process Group to order by introducing the newest member of Inner Horizons like a cheerleader -- "Rachel Interlachen! Yay!"

The day before, newbie-Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two Christ-spouting guards in matching ski jackets which meant that Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to have somebody else take their flipped-out, sobbing, and often violent daughter on a plane ride out of their hair. Rachel, a tall, hollow-faced girl who looked about 15, though she had to be at least 18 to be in the Program, wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." Her arms sported horizontal cut marks --- not vertical. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like most of the girls in the program. Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a skinny-ass cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up in rural Idaho, everybody called the place You-Da-Hoe? Get it? You -- Da -- Hoe, for doing whatever fucked up shit that landed you in the middle of the Idaho wilderness with people even more fucked up than you.

When she was twelve, Old Girl had tried the easy route to oblivion. She raided the medicine cabinet at her guardians' house in Naperville, Illinois. Unfortunately, Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Among every multivitamin and mineral in the alphabet and jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed caplets and fish oil by the gallon, Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was a horrible way to go?

Now 18, after two years in the Program, Old Girl applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to off herself. Nothing gross, for example, like the Ex-Lax fiasco. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed at 16 like an elephant seal out of Lake Minnetonka by an eager-beaver camp counselor named Scout---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water vomited so hard that a blood vessel burst in one eye ---all bodily fluids were verboten. Double-ditto road rash, like the kind she'd suffered when she'd fallen out of David's Buick when he motored around a corner on the way home from picking her up at middle school. She'd let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door and learned a good lesson in physics (or was it calculus?) about objects in motion. The car had to be going at least thirty-five miles an hour or it wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken arm and the experience of having gravel hand picked out of her right side with tweezers.

Hanging was definitely off the approved list. She'd had to leave Girl Scouts before knot tying, when Mom and Dad were killed in a car crash, so she'd never learned anything more complicated than a slip knot. But her main objection to asphyxiation was something she'd read somewhere about how people's tongues swelled up three times their normal size and then hung out of their mouths like blue-black eels. One guy had an eyeball start out of his eye socket. Nope. None of that.

When Old Girl "graduated" from Adolescents (ages 14-17) to Young Adults (ages 18-22)right after New Year's, they'd moved her from Calm Cottage in downtown Couer D'Alene to Healing House, which was out in the sticks, 15 miles out of town. Frankly, she couldn't see any improvement in the level of maturity in her peers unless she counted the leap in psychobabble. All the morons sprawled out like a flock of chattering crows in the off-kilter circle of couches and chairs crowding the Healing House living room could spout on about accountability and self-actualization and personal space and validation like paid psychiatric professionals, though now they were fighting as viciously as a pack of hyenas about whose turn it was to go first.

Cold pressed in on Old Girl from outside through the glass. The wall thermometer on the outside of Healing House read 28 degrees. An hour ago, it was 25 degrees. Yippee! At breakfast, she'd heard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the garbageman who also did general fix-it chores. Margaret told him to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery. How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The volume of Margaret's voice made it seem like it was imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd hollered out. Like that should mean something to the filthy garbage man who stank like the garbage he picked up in a rackety truck that he drove like a maniac. Maybe melting was the key. She'd noticed the icicle dripping during the day, then refreezing during the night, so she assumed it was the cycle of melt and freeze that thickened the thing into a weapon in the first place.

Thinking about gravity and physics and mass and motion gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her actual attempts---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

A small-boned and wiry girl, with the pale complexion of a red head, she allowed herself to be slightly taller while death bleached out the freckles on her face and left a fetching spray of dots across a slightly straightened nose. Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David drove off with vague admonitions to "get well," she thought about styling her hair with a curling iron so it could fan around her face like a halo of sunstorms around the corona of her head. A new North Face puff jacket in leafy-green or maybe teal would look good with cinnamon-red hair. At sunset, in an orange or red jacket, she would glow like an ember in the dying day.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job.

Old Girl wasn't the most patient person. She'd probably end up cutting them off with the garden shears or realistically, Margaret would have to be called in to wield the scissors because anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Lydia Bronfmann, who had to read her Accountability Letter first, was a cutter. Lydia was also a nympho and a bulimic and an uber-rich, Jewish American Princess from Grosse Point Michigan. You could hear Michigan in her nasal singsong as she droned through an apology letter for fucking Axel Friedman, her therapist. People liked Axel but rumor had it, Lydia's fuck fiesta had gotten him fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers at Inner Horizons by expulsion. No way were they letting go of Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why in fact Lydia was apologizing to Process Group in the first place. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like baying at the moon since she fucked everybody. Only Paul, the Asperbergery math wizard, could count that high.

Lydia detailed a long list of behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn-holing in a breathy voice reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe and pretty soon, she had everybody was laughing. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper ..." she was saying, enjoying her moment in front of an audience. "He said no, that wasn't appropriate touching but that's not what his woody was saying..."

Darlene rapped her pen on aclipboard. "We don't want to hear all chapter-and-verse, we want to hear what you're taking ownership of."

Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by sapphire earrings the size of quarters. "How can I take ownership of what I did if I don't describe it?"

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep going,"

"Well, he was moaning... But you know? In a good way..."

Old Girl's favorite time of day was that moment in bed, right after she turned out the light and closed her eyes to the dark, and imagined adeath when everything went according to plan. Sometimes, she had a hard time drifting off to sleep because her mind would be too busy fabricating the bones of the story. Scenes that led up to the climax and the aftermath were as thickly plotted as operettas. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Vera Wang dresses. Nothing Jessica McClintock sluts-ville for Old Girl. Lavender played a primary role. Her own actions were secretive and smart with just the right amount of clues to foreshadow her plans. Weather and setting, depending on her mood, varied between dark and creep-meister or lit in film noir dark and light or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she would imagine a fishing boat that sailed oblivious to the tragedy or a person dropping off a load of clothes at the dry cleaners. Tragedy didn't have to slap you in the face.

She wondered if the weather had to warm up more to make the icicle scene work. If she watched the temperature during Process Group three times a week and checked it before dinner every day, she'd get a read on the progress of melting and refreezing and maybe she'd be able to cross-reference that with the fluctuations in the weather. Fantasizing every minute detail of her death was so much more satisfying than actually doing it. The problem with real life was that there was so little you could control.

She always applied the strict rules of realism to the manner of death. No pianos dropping out of the sky. No earthquakes that opened up a giant trench in front of her. She herself had to the agent of her demise. She couldn't be passive while some magician of fate or a *deus ex machina* that she's read about in an online class on Greek tragedy did the work. That's why death-by-icicle dagger wasn't ideal. She'd have to pick the exact right moment to stand under it when it was likely to fall. It occurred to her that if she ran a garden hose over the ice on the eaves long enough, maybe the water would loosen it at its moorings. When gravity took over and it knocked her brains out, people would think she'd only been trying to be helpful by trying to remove the danger to others. Killed in the line of duty. That was a plot line she hadn't explored.

"Angela! Wake up!" An insistent edge in Darlene's Boston-accented voice, cut into her concentration. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come set the table.

"Angela! You're wool gathering! Come back to the party!"

Old Girl shook her head. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocably would *not* answer to the name she'd been given before her family was taken away. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and an ache in her stomach from having it pumped, she renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be dumped in the middle of some alternate existence, the alternate existence could bestow her with a new name, a new identity. She felt as old as Methuselah. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

Darlene tapped at her annoying clipboard. "Angela, we're waiting?"

"I don't know anybody named Angela. She doesn't exist."

"Excuuuuuuse me. Would Old Girl please join us?" Darlene put air quotes around "Old Girl."

Old Girl thought about the pleasures of double homicide-suicide. Reluctantly, she turned her back on the icicle. Jesus. Watching an icicle grow. The Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. On the bright side, she added the number 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Lydia was md-sentence. "... My favorite time was coercing a police officer with a blow job." Lydia shrugged, black curls abob over a pink cashmere sweater. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene, who wasn't born yesterday, scribbled something on her clip board, then said briskly, "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit this Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist shake up. Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved to Young Adults. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized program founder, had been her therapist from the beginning. A Yale degree in psychiatry on Hazey's s wall said he specialized in Adolescents, probably because he still was one, though the old guy was in his dotage. When did dotage start? She'd seen the year 1986 on one of a dozen diplomas mounted on Hazey's office wall one day when she was too wound up to sit down during session. That would mean the old fart had to be what... 46? No, 47. She didn't know why she'd tucked that worthless piece of information in the back of her mind like a magpie with a shiny bit of tin.

Wouldn't it be great if there was a *deux ex machina* who could blow up Process Group with a hydrogen bomb so she could float a million miles above the Pacific ocean in a spangle of atomic particles? Hell, she'd settle for floating as far as Spokane. It had a nice river walk that would be lovely from the air. In that scenario, of course, all the detail work would be concentrated on the after, not the explosion. A bright flash, all that was needed. A spangle of tiny particles. The tender bits of what used to make her human held aloft by the hands of the wind.

James Olson, the tall gangly surfer from Malibu, California, had taken the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche when he was stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd admitted in one of those tense horrible, shamefests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get up. "I traded my Revos for the candy," he was saying.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons where a \$300 pair of sunglasses were worth \$5 worth of sugar high.

"Darlene asked, "Who'd you trade with?"

"Somebody from NICC." Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, the meth-addict, supplied the candy because he was wearing a New York Jets cap with the Revos hanging off the back of it. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College where Young Adults in Transition were allowed to take 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If he'd really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with his trade. Within Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy and Daddy he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex and ching-ching-ching, a few more Milky Ways would show up in the stash under James Olson's mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, another drip of moisture beaded up and rolled to the edge of the eaves. It hung there forever as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimension. The hang time stretched on and on until Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. Only a slim, silvery wetness on the side of the sharpening icicle told her that it was still present, though in another form. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

When the circle of accountable behaviors had looped through cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, incest, road rage, gambling addiction, indecent exposure, fire starting, and property destruction --- if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it--- it finally came back around to newbie-Rachel. Darlene urged her to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Old Girl felt for the newbie who eyed the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her like Old Girl's suicide tries had aged her. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the living room passing over her gills. She stood up, as if to address the jury of her peers, but instead, she toppled slowly backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

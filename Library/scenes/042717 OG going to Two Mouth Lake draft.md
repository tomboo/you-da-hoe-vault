042717 OG going to Two Mouth Lake draft

FIVE

MONDAY WAS OUTDOOR ACTIVITY DAY. People were trying to find their snow gear. Old Girl waited at the front door, hat pulled over her ears, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy blue down. She feIt like a preschooler. Where was the mitten leash that slipped through both arms of the coat and over her neck?

They were supposed to leave at eleven but by the time everybody found all their gear, it would be closer to eleven-thirty. It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door of the house she grew up in in Portland, Oregon, while Mom wrestled Gabe into his snowsuit. She was five years older so she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding his compact square body between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down in order to cork his foot into a green boot. Old Girl always thought she should hear a pop when the foot finally slipped in. Did it bloop? Or was it more like a thwock? What's reverse of a champagne cork, she thought with sadness. A thwoop?

What had Gabe been doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the sun-dappled Before of her life, and came up blank. Gabe was a sunny-tempered dark-haired baby -- not the colicky screamer she had been, according to Aunt Peggy. Her mind was now as emptied of him as an ice-covered lake.

Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. He was a builder and she used to be able to call him up by smelling fresh-cut wood. Now, when she carried kindling and split logs for Healing House's wood stove, all she smelled was pitch. Dad was gone, escaped up the chimney. He was even farther away than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a senior citizen had driven a Cadillac up on the sidewalk and crushed all three of them.

The sky was its usual color of cement. The van hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how the Idahoans said it). A French name from some ancient trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just eleven kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the blizzards.

Barely five miles out of town, James and Lydia got a warning for inappropriate touching and they were separated. Now James sat next to the driver in the front, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Lydia's crotch and Rachel Interlachen slumped against the window next to him. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but she'd checked out okay at the hospital after her fit. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Lydia in the far back of the Suburban AKA Barfland.

Barfland felt glacial. Luckily, Lydia was in a pout so Old Girl didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Lydia had traded oral sex for candy in the past week. Blowjobs. Just another word for Idaho money, Lydia had told her last week.

Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House. Endless blue trees. A landscape where nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About three miles was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature dropped.

Josh told them the plan was to make them snowshoe up to Surprise Lake. It fed into the main lake. The hike was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head back to the van.

The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt like she was always being assaulted. After Peggy and David drove off, the first thing she understood had been taken away was a quiet place to hear herself think. For the millionth time, Old Girl missed her iPod, which had been confiscated the day she came into the Program. Some asshole had broken into the storage locker where contraband was kept---probably Reza, the klepto---and now it was permanently lost.

Old Girl had dark plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

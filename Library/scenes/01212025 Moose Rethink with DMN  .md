01212025 Moose Rethink with DMN

They used the creature's fear and drove him through the channel by shouting and banging sticks on the ice.

Continuation of 01222025 writing

She was screaming at James and Rachel to go find sticks before she could put her thoughts around the old Indian word Dad had taught her that day at the Smithsonian. It was *travois.* French, not native, she corrected herself, inanely, while in her head, her dad waxed on about how brilliant the American Indians were to figure out the physics of crossing two sticks and attaching blankets to drag behind humans or horses.

It took more time to argue James and Rachel into helping her than it took all three of them to locate a couple long alder trunks broken off at the base by the force of the flood that carried them downstream. With Rachel's help, she tied James's long jacket sleeves over and under the trunks to create a carrier sturdy enough to bear rocks.

(Rachel was all in for saving the moose, way before she understood the concept of using the make-shift travois to ferry a load of rocks from the creek bed out to the open channel in the lake. OG herself didn't know if her idea to use the rocky weigh to break a channel to the shore would work. She was so gung-ho about breaking the channel, it didn't occur to her that the moose might be too stupid to use it.

James wasted time arguing with her about how dangerous it was to go further out on the ice. She didn't share this with James but it she fell in, what the hell did she care? But despite that wayward thought, she really was't trying to kill herself for once. She wanted to keep the moose alive. But if death was the side effect for saving the wild creature when she couldn't save the people she loved most, well that would be water under the bridge.

Rachel talked James into donating his expedition-strength jacket to the effort.

"You two are nut jobs," he said, ask the same time he was already shrugging out of the jacket which had a label that read, "X-Large, Expedition Weight" sewed into the neck.

By following the tracks of the moose and spotting where water started to seep into them from its weight, James decided when it was time to start crawling on hands and knees to spread out their weight. "I'm not pulling you out if you go in," he told OG. "I don't care if you drown."

"I won't ask you to. Just help me right now."

James gave her a look of calculation. "Fine, but you're still a bitch." It was weird that his tone was vaguely transactional, like he was saying, so if you'll help a moose, can I count on you to help me?

10052025 Margaret Is Saved by One Black Shoe

Monday morning at 9 am sharp, Margaret O'Leary, Patient Supervisor, arrives at the office of Dr. Aloysius Hazey, Founder and Psychiatric Director of Inner Horizons Treatment Center for Young Adults, expecting to lose her shitty-paying job. Dr. Hazey is in full intimidation mode, mad as hell but pretending to be relaxed with his big feet up on his desk as he lectures his most loyal and efficient worker on how she could march militantly up the driveway, gray curls swinging like a Medusa, with a paint gun under her arm the size of long gun, at the exact moment the Idaho State Insurance Review Committee arrived! Further, Dr. Hazey wants to know how Margaret could have gotten off three blasts in a row that set off the screams of a feral pack of raccoons and stampeded the committee with the result that Dr. Irving Evensong, Committee President, fell over backward and hit his head and was now, a full week later, STILL recovering from a Grade 3 (severe) concussion. With the Certification Review on hold, Dr. Hazey's US Bank loan for a major expansion of the Program is at risk and Dr. Hazey wants to know, "what the HELL she was thinking?!!" Margaret, hemming and hahing and trying to think on trembling feet, is saved by Hazey 's appalled realization that the size 12 Triple E Feet on top of his desk are clad in one black shoe and one brown shoe! He can't lunch with the US Bank Exec Team with mismatched shoes, nor can he impress Lydia's mother who has flown in by Lear jet to keep paying Lydia's exorbitant fees so Margaret is summarily dispatched to drive his Gold Lexus toot-sweet to his house and find the mate.

100414 OG gets off the fence draft

It was one of those days when everybody wanted to poke a stick in somebody's eye.

Too cold to hike. Van in the shop. No 'scrip or grocery pick-ups. No bowling. Not even a stupid trip to the post office.

Darlene had tried to cajole the group into going out to build a snow man like they were all still in preschool but nobody would move off the couch. Everybody suddenly had homework, or accountability reports, or letters to write but once Darlene's back was turned, nobody worked on them. Instead, they tormented Esty.

She'd been half-dragged-half-shoved back to Healing House after two weeks in Stable. Darlene and Gretchen deposited her like a rag doll on the old flowered couch in the living room.

For most of the afternoon, Esty had absorbed the group's jabs with the mute patience of a cow in the field. Did Reza and Danny torture her just to see if they could get a rise out of her? Or was it some kind of need to get a reaction to prove they were strong and Esty was weak?

"Esty, you've got a lard ass." Danny said from her queen's perch on the only wingback chair in the living room. "Don't you ever look at yourself in the mirror?"

Danny had the double she shared with Esty all to herself for two whole weeks while Esty was being drugged to the teeth on whatever antipsychotics they were giving her. You'd think the bitch would have been thankful for the break.

"Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?" Reza, the ex-meth addict, who was dark and wiry as a ferret, seized the floor. "A smart ass!"

Old Girl couldn't remember how long Esty had been at the Program. Longer than she'd been there and she was one of the old timers. She was like a fixture, say a chair or a Naugahyde Barcalounger that they all stepped over. She'd clocked a therapist with a hair dryer in a fit of anger, hence her latest trip to Stable. Most people gave her a wide berth rather than chance a sock in the jaw but when she was zonked out on Seroquel , teasing her was more fun than watching the icicles melt and freeze into daggers.

"When are you going to take a shower?" said Danny.

"You stink!" 

Estie absorbed their needling with barely a quiver. It was like whatever they had given her at Stable had turned her into a bowl full of Jello. After ten minutes, Old Girl wanted to slap her herself. Christ, can\'t you defend yourself? You\'re bigger than both of them!

Danny, the ringleader, was a tall girl (bulimic, naturally). Crazy athletic with a natural volleyball spike that had nearly broken Old Girl's neck one day when it got away from her. Hard to say how old she was. Twenty-one, maybe, with sharp, glacial eyes and coarse blonde hair that stood up like a shock of hay from her scalp. Her biceps were chiseled from doing one-armed push-ups every day.

Old Girl had learned her first day in Transition to stay out of her orbit. Danny surrounded herself with a coterie of sycophants though today, only Rezza, the motor-mouth, acted as her enforcer. Tonight, a "celebration" was planned because Danny was getting out of the Program ahead of schedule. It was possible her parents had run out of money or maybe the counselors had finally figured out she was too dangerous to have around.

The problem was, once it was announces that Danny was \"graduating\", she became untouchable. Nobody with half a brain wanted to fuck up her departure. It was safer to keep out of her sight lines with the promise of being free of her cruelty in a few days.

*Jesus, you smell like R. Kelly\'s sheets.* Reza had stolen the line from Macklemore but Old Girl wasn't about to draw his attention. If Etsy was awake, she could have hoisted him over a shoulder and tossed him out the window without breaking a sweat.

Not long before it was time for dinner, Esty lumbered off the couch to go to the bathroom. While she was gone, Reza and Paul started arm wrestling on the floor. One of them kicked over a glass of water on the end table next to the flowered couch. They ignored it, letting the spill soak into the cushions, not that the old couch would be worse for wear.

Esty came back and immediately sat on the wet spot and that made everybody whoop with laughter. Her face blank as milk, not a clue why everyone was hooting at her. Jesus. Was Esty so slow she didn't feel her butt getting wet?

Reza crowed, "You just went to the bathroom!"

Esty scratched at her belly. "Yeah?"

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

You could almost see the gears in Esty's drugged brain clanking toward the awareness of dampness on her pants. She stood up and turned abroad, cottage-cheesed ass to the group and tried to peer at herself over her shoulder. Her hand groped at the dark and spreading stain.

\"You pissed your pants!\" Reza said.

\"Did not.\" said Estie.

"Sure you did. Why aren't you wearing diapers?"

A little muscle in Estie\'s jaw ticked like a timer. She kept twisting her head over her shoulder, trying to look at herself the way a dog chases its tail.

Esty frowned down at her hand. You could almost hear her brain formulating the word "wet" before her hand registered its dampness. \"Who did that?\"

Reza and Danny were howling like hyenas by then, shouting \"Stink Ass\" and \"Pee Wee.\" Old Girl couldn\'t stop herself from laughing at Esty's flummoxed look of incomprehension.

A few days ago, Old Girl had overheard Margaret tell Dr. Hazey that they needed to buy Reza a rubber sheet because he kept soaking the mattress. If Old Girl had been wetting her bed, she would have kept her mouth shut when somebody else couldn't control their bladder. Naturally, Reza did the opposite. Apparently, if you hated yourself for being weak, the second you got a chance to hurt someone even weaker, you piled on with both feet and then used your kidneys to piss on them. Did hurting someone else feel that much better than being hurt?

Soon, the whole group was in on it. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Piss and vinegar!" "R. Kelly and Etsy---PiSSSSS!!" Nobody came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit, Old Girl told herself for perhaps the millionth time.

Etsy threw Old Girl, a look of silent pleading but Old Girl ignored her. She wanted to stab her for being so stupid. How could she be such a fucking victim? "No wonder Esty stinks," Old Girl called out. "She's piss poor at holding her water!"

Darlene finally called them into dinner shouting, "Meat loaf, yay! and it took Old Girl a few minutes to figure out their next little game.

Paul picked the seat across from Esty and Danny plopped down beside her while Reza took the chair on her other side. When the meatloaf dish was passed to Danny, she took a slice, then slid it across the table to Paul, who sent the dish down the opposite side of the table away from Esty. Reza speared a boiled potato and sent the serving dish the opposite direction. He repeated the action when the butter came to him, then the gray peas. The only food that landed near Esty was the undressed spinach salad with a lonely slice of hardboiled egg and two mushrooms.

Only Darlene was allowed to dress salad because half the kids including Esty were on restricted calorie diets. The diet didn\'t seem to be having any affect on Esty\'s bulk.

\"Hey, you skipped me with the meatloaf,\" Esty finally spoke in a low monotone to Danny.

\"I didn\'t,\" Danny said sweetly, shooting her a fakey, wide-eyed look. \"You said you didn\'t want any.\"

\"I was surprised you didn\'t want the potatoes either,\" Reza said, smoothly picking up the ball from Danny.

The only thing on Esty\'s plate was a midget-sized dinner roll\-- the only miserly carb allowed on the \"High Energy and Healthy Protein\" diet.

The hazy, vague look in her eyes for most of the afternoon had been replaced by narrow squint. A red flush crept up from her chest to her doughy cheeks.

Skinny Paul, who was on the high fat diet, was busy shoveling glops of butter onto Mt. Spudmore. "What?" Paul said, looking up. "The potatoes already went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't," said Etsy.

Darlene, sensing something brewing at the end of the table, interrupted her rant about black ice and called out, "Esty, how come you're not eating?"

Reza turned to Esty's plate and slopped a load of naked, wilting spinach on top of Esty's dinner roll. "Have some greens. It makes your shit smell sweet."

For a second, Old Girl thought Esty might cry. She was grimacing at the spinach and when she picked up her fork, Old Girl thought she would flick the crap to the floor. Instead, Esty gripped the handle in her fist and drove the tines into the back of Reza's hand.

Reza screamed. He tried to bolt up from the table, but Etsy stopped him by throwing her considerable bulk over his forearm and driving the fork deeper into the meat of his hand.

"Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated the babble. "Bitch!" "Esty, let go!" Stop! Stop!" Danny was pounding the table with her knife and fork, a crazy, high-pitched laugh rolling out of her like a loon call that went on and on while Darlene and Reza fought to dislodge Etsy's grip.

In the aftermath, with Estie laying over Rezza's torso, holding him down, while Darlene and Gretchen try to pull her off him, OG feels the stirring of hunger, something she hasn't felt in a long time.

It was clear that dinner was over. The celebratory dessert? Officially toast. Old Girl figured she'd have to go hungry till breakfast. She picked up an armful of dirty dishes and hip-butted the swinging kitchen door so she could stack them on the kitchen counter next to the sink.

To her surprise, Danny was in the kitchen ahead of her, hovering in big bites of lemon meringue pie.

"That's for everybody!" she cried who had a dollop of whipped cream on her lip.

"It's mine, "Danny said. "For graduating early."

"Graduated? You manipulated your way out of here."

"So?"

"So get your face out of that pie and leave some for the rest of us."

"Make me," Danny said with her mouth full. And that's when Old Girl pushed her face down into lemon custard and felt more satisfied than she had in her life.

Old Girl, seated at the bottom of the table, watched the herky-jerking bodies like a movie reel. She chewed and then carefully swallowed a bland boiled potato. Dessert was definitely off the table, she thought.

Feeling slightly nauseated and empty, Old Girl started picking up plates. Somebody might as well pick them up to avoid them getting smashed in the mayhem.

She butted one hip into the swinging door to the kitchen and stopped at the site of Danny burying her face and a lemon custard pie that Margaret had made to celebrate Danny\'s graduation.

The kitchen was quiet except for slurping, sucking sounds that Danny was making. Danny stood in profile to Old Girl, her blonde hair held away from her face which was partially submerged in the pie pan. When she met Old Girl\'s eyes, her eyebrows and eyelashes were dotted with clumps of whipped cream.

Old Girl set the stack of dirty plates down next to the sink. \"What the fuck? That\'s for everybody!\"

Danny stuck her tongue into the custard and lapped at it industriously as she swallowed pie filling and creamy glop and hoovered in large globs of crust without seeming to chew. It had only been 30 seconds, give or take, since Esty stabbed Reza with the fork. Old Girl could still hear Reza blubbering and whimpering in counterpoint to the commands of Darlene and Margaret to Etsy to let go.

Yet the pie for a dozen people was more than half gone.

\"You\'re sick!\" Old Girl cried.

\"Isn\'t everybody?\" Danny looked at Old Girl with a greasy beard of yellow dripping from her chin. \"Why do you think we are locked up here? You\'re just as fucked up as the rest of us.\"

> \"I\'m not!\" Old Girl cried. \"I\'d never hurt somebody like you do.\"\
> \"You just did,\" Danny said, using one hand to scoop a cream into her mouth. Her eyes were flat and lifeless as a corpse.

"That's for everybody!" Old Girl said again.

"It's mine, "Danny said. "For graduating early."

"You didn't graduate. You manipulated your way out of here."

"So?"

"So get your face out of that pie and leave some for the rest of us."

"Make me," Danny said with her mouth full.

And that's when Old Girl pushed Danny's head down into the lemon custard and ground her face ash hard as she could, feeling not full, but completely satisfied.

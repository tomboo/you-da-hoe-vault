012619 Reza reacts to being stabbed in fork scene

"She stabbed me!" Reza howled. His sense of outrage was immense. "What the hell! She's insane!"

"You didn't pass her the peas," OG said, matter-of-factly. "Try using your manners next time."

"I was just kidding."

"If that's your idea of a joke, you've got more troubles than I can help you with."

"Of course I'm in trouble," he said. "I'm stuck to the table with a fork."

It was true. After a lot of palavering and argument, Darlene and Gretchen decided they shouldn't remove the fork; they should leave it in place for medical people "who knew what they were doing." Gretchen referred to this idea as "keeping it in situ" which made it sound more intelligent than Josh's practical idea of unscrewing the table leaf and carting it out with Reza's arm stabilized by a bunch of couch cushions.

"Jesus," James said. "He's not going to bleed to death, for fuck sake. It's only a fork not a twelve-inch blade. Plus it's in his hand, for crying out loud. What vital organ could it hit?"

"Good thing it wasn't around his dick," was Big Paul's commentary.

Gretchen, not to be dissuaded, oversaw the production to get both the table leaf and Reza, now crying bitterly, out the front door.

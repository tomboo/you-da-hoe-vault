**Frank Lloyd Wright**

No house should ever be on a hill or on anything. It should be of the hill. Belonging to it. Hill and house should live together each the happier for the other. Frank Lloyd Wright

Tip the world over on its side and everything loose will land in Los Angeles. Frank Lloyd Wright

Stephen Jay Gould

A lot of scientists hate writing. Most scientists love being in the lab and doing the work and when the work is done, they are finished. Stephen Jay Gould\

Siddhartha Mukherjee

Over the summer of 2011, the water in Lake Michigan turned crystal clear. Shafts of angled light lit the lake bed, like searchlights from a U.F.O.; later, old sunken ships came into view from above. Pleasure was soon replaced by panic: lakes are not supposed to look like swimming pools. When biologists investigated, they found that the turbid swirls of plankton that typically grow in the lake by the million had nearly vanished---consumed gradually, they could only guess, by some ravenous organism.

He invites me to join him, to have a look at the auspicious piles of worm castings, the clover leaves just breaking, and the two inches of fresh growth that one particular blade of grass has put on in the five days since this paddock was last grazed. Down here among the fescues is where Salatin makes some of his most important decisions, working out the intricate, multispecies grazing rotations that have made Polyface one of the most productive, sustainable, and influential family farms in America.

I never got any training in how to write novels as an English major at Oberlin, but I got some great training for writing novels from anthropology and from Margaret Mead. Alan Furst\

Author of Stiff, Bonk, Grunt, etc.

I have no doubt that I\'m a running joke at the interlibrary loan department of the San Francisco Public Library, where I have requested, over the past two years, papers with titles like \"On the function of Groaning and Hyperventilation during Intercourse\" and \"An Anal Probe for Monitoring Vascular and Musular Events During Sexual Response.\" Last summer, I was in a medical school library Xeroxing a journal article called \"Vacuum Cleaner Use in Autoerotic Death\" when the paper jammed. I could not bring myself to ask the copy room attendant to help me, but moved quietly over to the adjacent machine and began again.

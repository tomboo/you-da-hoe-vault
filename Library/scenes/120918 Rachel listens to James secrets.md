120918 Rachel listens to James secrets

"Tell Josh," she said. "Then tell your parents."

"What's so important about telling?"

"You get the shit out and it stinks and once it's out, it loses its power to poison you. If it stays inside, it festers or ferments and it grows uglier and the stench grows and pretty soon --like over days and months and years -- it consumes you. You get to eighty or ninety, when you're supposed to have lived a good life, and there's nothing there but puss and shit and ugliness."

"How'd you get to be so smart?" James said, after a long pause.

Rachel paused. Long fingers touched her beautiful shapely mouth. "I'm not smart. Just observant."

"Who'd you observe?"

"Myself."

She will think of this moment in a future she can't imagine when her own daughter years later will be struggling with adolescent trauma. She will have no idea how she arrived at the truth with so little experience of life at the time. But she won't question the bedrock she's on then, any more than she questions its bedrock in the bowling alley diner with James. It's a gift, she understands without knowing when or where or if it will come again.

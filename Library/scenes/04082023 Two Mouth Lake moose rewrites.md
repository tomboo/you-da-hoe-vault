04082023 Two Mouth Lake moose rewrites

By unspoken agreement, OG, Rachel and James kept silent about what they had witnessed. OG could barely articulate her own feelings of devastation. There was no way she could put herself in Rachel's shoes or James's shoes. She was just thankful they kept their lips zipped.\
Later in the night after lights out, she replayed the moose's struggles to climb onto the ice above the whorling water. Each time it threw its heavy body onto the ice and thee shelf gave way, it seemed to take something out of the animal's will until it was too cold and exhausted to keep swimming. What troubled her as was the moment it gave in to the swirl and suck of the circling water. It held its head up, whale-eyed with the whites showing, its nose holes distended to suck in air to its gasping lungs. Then like something threw an electric switch its head sank soundless into the churning blackness. Blue white ice chunks continued to bob and circle in the emptiness.

It's head sank into the churning gyre. By some strange oddity of chance, a random sun beam broke through clouds at that moment and traced the edge of its finger-like antlers. It reflected gold against blue white snow for a split secondhand her last sight was a hand limned in light that was swallowed by blackness.

OG imagined its legs slowing their frantic pedaling as the weight of the wide duall antlers pressed its head down into the blue, then blackening depths.

Had it given up? Did it make a conscious decision to stop trying? Had whatever a dumb animal knew of hope been replaced by the feeling of futility? In its last moments, she kept replaying that last moment in time when the struggle became too much and the fight leached out of it. It was just easier to let gravity take over fall forever into blue that was subsumed by black and then blank.

Why do the kids make this wordless pact to keep this sight to themselves? They witness something extraordinary. A magnificent animal in the peak of health walks across a seeming solid ice sheet. It's lulled by the ice's seeming thickness until he crack alerts it to its danger and its weight catches up to the physics of ice that has been weakened by a current of moving water from the creek.

She wonders if Mom and Dad, please God not Gabe, had that moment of clarity with futility that the moose intuited when tiredness overcame its strength.

The 80-year-old's foot had been pressed to the gas pedal he mistook for the brake. So the family van was relentlessly pushed forward onto the train tracks and the looming train. How long had they known that death was approaching as the two cars ground over flat concrete and climbed up a short asphalt grade before the van hit the tracks until it was centered on the tracks while Dad must have been braking furiously, trying to forestall gravity's relentless push. The train engineer was blowing his horn and braking furiously too; the screeching of metal on metal split the air and the air horn blew at the top of the decibel range, according to the court testimony she read at the library. There was no possible way to communicate when the loud screeching and the horn and the protest of the overheating engine tightened around them like a noose that crushed the car and their bodies in around the curve of the cow-catcher attached to the engine.Did Dad reach for Mom's hand? Was Mom able to reach back toward Gave in the car seat that protected him enough to allow him to live for 48 hours on a ventilator?

She imagines them sliding inexorably toward their doom on the tracks. The van is pancaked from the rear by the 80-year-old in the ancient pick-up that was heavier and lower than usual because it was carrying a load of cement blocks for his garden. Death by gravity, like the moose and its slow gravity-led descent into the depths. Ggravity keeps us upright until it orchestrates our inevitable fall.

By unspoken agreement, the three of them were in agreement that they have witnessed something extraordinary. Whether it was horrible or terrible or miraculous was not something they would ever discuss.

When the rest of the group arrived at the lake, James said something big had tried to cross the lake and fell in. Whatever, it was was only identifiable by its tracks which kids from Chicago and New Jersey and California and Oakland had never seen. Josh looked at the cloven print and pronounced it a moose based on its width and how far it sunk in from the animal's weight.

That's when Reza said it was Big Foot. Dani said hell no, it was Godzilla. They started throwing snowballs at each other until the argument dissolved into all-out warfare with everybody except OG and James and Rachel.

Josh ordered everyone to hotfoot it back to the van when they were all wet and cold. OG ran most of the way on her snowshoes until James passed her up and Rachel actually stepped on the back of one of her shoes and made her fall.

Does the moose come up at the bowling alley when James comes clean to Rachel?

"Do you remember seeing the moose at Two Mouth Lake?" Rachel asked James

"Of course. Don't you?"

Rachel bit into one of the French fries on James's plate.

"Why do you think it was so peaceful at the end? It just sank. Not even a hint of a struggle."

"It must have given up," Rachel said. "It was too tired."

"I feel that way all the time. At home. Here. Wherever I am, it feels hopeless," said James.

"But you're still trying. You're not giving up."

"Not yet, I haven't."

James heart took a lurch that felt like a car tumbling over and over into a canyon. The faint pink vertical scars on the inside of Rachel's right wrist seemed to point right at her heart. He reached past his plate and touched the raised skin gently. "Is that how you felt when you did this?"

She lifted her shoulders. Guilty.

"I wonder his he is right this minute," she whispered. "I miss him so much. It's stupid because I didn't even know him."

James for once was smarter than he knew. "A baby comes out of you knowing a lot after nine whole months. "They know what their mom smells like. How you sound."

Rachel said, "He turned his head to me and opened his eyes." Rachel put her hand on James's had, the one that had touched her wrist. "What happened to you? I felt better when I told you about how my mom stole my baby. What ripped your heart from your chest?"

Now it was James turn to feel his heart lurch sideways or maybe upside down, like he was hanging from the roof, suspended by a seat belt.

"Your hamburger is going to get cold," she said.

"You want that too, now that you finished my fries?"

"I guess I was hungry."

James pushed the plate towards her and he began to talk.

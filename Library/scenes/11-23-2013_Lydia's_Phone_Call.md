Lydia\'s Phone Call

Lydia had no trouble getting through to her grandfather. He seemed bemused that she wanted to make a charitable donation with her trust money. \"This is a first,\" Pop-pop said. \"Who should I have the check made out to? Is it a 501K-3? Are they a certified non-profit?\"

Lydia had no idea. Didn\'t you just write a check with a lot of zeroes at the end of it? Apparently not.

Grandpa Rosenblum said he\'d call Brother Boniface and get the numbers he needed to square it with the terms of the trust. Lydia could ask for anything, it appeared, if it was of a personal nature. \$5000 for a coat? No problem. \$2500 for a Judith Lieser bag? Where do we send the check? A donation to a charitable institution took a lot of rigmarole she wasn\'t prepared for.

The most interesting part of the conversation came when Grandpa Rosenblum quizzed her about how much she wanted to give. She\'d originally asked for \$10,000, not having the slightest idea what a place like the Povarello Center would need.

\"What do they need the money for? Is it a capital campaign?\"

Lydia wasn\'t sure what a capital campaign was but it didn\'t seem like a 3 -story piece of crap building with gurgling plumbing and cracked linoleum hall likely had one. \"They need a new roof,\" She said, remembering Brother Boniface and his impish joke.

\"Roofs cost a lot more than \$10,000, Lydia. We haven\'t made any charitable donations from the trust fund for quite a while. Do you think \$100,000 would be spent wisely?\"

Lydia saw in her mind's eye Brother Boniface doing cartwheels down the Povarello hall, brown robe and rope belt flying with the dust motes.

\"Let\'s make it 2, just to be safe,\" she said. She could almost see the line of zeroes rolling out under his Mont Blanc pen like a row of ball rooms.

\"Nice to hear your voice, honey. Call anytime,\" Grandpa Rosenblum, a remote pin-striped figure who spent most of his waking hours at his downtown office sounded almost human.

\"Are they treating you alright at that place in Idaho?\"

His voice went up on the last syllable of Idaho like it was in the same location as Timbuctoo which it probably was, now that she thought of the mean streets of Coeur D'Alene compared to downtown Detroit.

Off to Individual Therapy with Rosa who was always trying to get her to be less impulsive. Should she tell her what she\'d done? Yes to the job- it was part of the stupid program commitments- no to the donation. Sometimes she had impulses she just couldn\'t control.

James was bagging potatoes at the food pantry. It was a mindless task and being mindless suited him just fine. All the excitement of the fire and being up till 3AM then so wound up the adrenalin after being in close proximity to Rachel under the blanket made it hard to get to sleep. It felt like he\'d just dropped off when the alarm blared him awake.

His eyeballs felt gravelly like the dirt encrusted Idaho spuds he was shoveling into net bags. He was using his arm to roll the lumps en masse into the lip of the bag, it seemed more efficient than Reza\'s one-potato-two-potato method on the table next to him. Both of them had about a ton of spuds to bag before noon when the clients who needed them would be lined up around the block.

Thank God they\'d brought in another worker or they\'d be bagging potatoes till midnight not that he\'d be allowed to stay to get the job done. James was still on a short leash with Inner Journeys that consisted of classes at NICC and now, just a little more rope to hang himself, the community service job at the food pantry.

While he tied off a spud bag with a zip tie, he said hey to the new guy, Lorenzo. He was a big freckled faced red head with a clown's cap of curly hair that stuck out around a baseball cap. \"What\'s LDS stand for?\" James nodded at the guy\'s cap.

\"Church of Latter Day Saints,\" he said.

\"You\'re Mormon?\"

If James was pretty efficient at bagging spuds, this Lorenzo was a spud machine. He was bagging two bags to James' one and barely breaking a sweat.

\"Used to be Mormon," Lorenzo said turning to shovel more spuds from the mountain behind them onto his work table. \"It\'s an old hat.\"

It was around 8:30 and he was drinking a can of coke.

\"Breakfast of champions!\" He said, \"Like you.\"

\"Guess I should have known you weren\'t Mormon. Isn\'t caffeine against the rules?\"

\"Like a lot of things,\" Lorenzo said. \"I don\'t think I\'m going to hell for it. Do you?\"

James had sped up his bagging matching the big kid\'s efficient movements. Reza meanwhile was teaching himself to juggle with 3 potatoes form hi s untouched pile.

\"Jeez, Reza, could you put some energy into getting this done?\"

One of Reza\'s potatoes dropped out of their wobbly arc and rolled over by Lorenzo. He went under the table to retrieve it. He came up with 3 runaways that had fallen during the bagging and he tossed them effortlessly in the air and kept all 3 in the air. \"You gotta start with ones that are the same size when you\'re learning,\" he said to Reza.

He let the last spud drop into an outstretched hand, then added a fourth ungainly spud to his grouping and showed them how to counter-weight the heavy one against the 3 similar sized ones. Pretty soon James was trying it and he was surprised to see that Lorenzo\'s method worked pretty well.

About the time that all 3 of them had their spuds all in the air, Mr. McGregor who ran the volunteers at the food pantry barreled in with a load of parsnips. He rolled his eyes and saad, \"Get in gear, you three. Hungry people can\'t wait.\"

After that the three of them buckled down, even Reza, and by end of shift, they\'d finished the Sisphyphean mountain of potatoes and made a pretty good dent in the parsnips.

\"Hey, do you know the difference between parsnips on a plate and a girl?\" Reza said.

\"I\'ll bite\" said Lorenzo.

\"A girl gets eaten and parsnips don\'t,\" Reza said, completely dead pan.

James whooped. Lorenzo looked completely blank.

\"I don\'t get it, \" he said.

He looked at James who had been fantasizing about Rachel and the feel of her butt pressed up to him, as if he expected him to explain.

\"Oh hell no,\" James said. \"Lorenzo is an innocent. If he doesn\'t get it you\'re not going to tell him.\"

\"Let\'s introduce him to Lydia and he can learn it the easy way.\"

Lorenzo frowned. \" Are you talking about Lydia Rosenblum?\"

His gaze which had been open and friendly, looked as cold as the angel Moroni on a winter\'s day.

\"Do you know Lydia?\" James asked.

\" She\'s in my Comparative Religion class, \" Lorenzo said.

\"What does that parsnip thing mean? They taste OK.\"

Luckily a horn blasted outside. Margaret's signal that the van was waiting in the parking lot. \"That\'s our ride.\" James nodded apologetically, like he\'d stay and explain if he could. For some reason he was glad as hell to get out of the food pantry before the big guy pounded Reza into a greasy spot.

\"Jesus Reza. Use some judgment about the jokes you tell.\"

Reza was busy pulling out the potatoes he\'d loaded in his pocket. \"Pretty cool juggling tips, weren\'t they?\"

James groaned. What would it be like to go around every day of your life like Reza completely cluelesss about the feelings of the people around you?

It was one of those weird times in life when James felt like he\'d came up to a precipice and had the foresight not to jump in. Lorenzo\'s expression was innocent and open. He really didn\'t get the stupid joke and James had been about to explain it to him. It was only a joke right? It was just Reza horsing around in his thoughtless way.

But when James saw how Lorenzo looked when Reza mentioned having Lydia demonstrate how girls like to be eaten, it felt like the lip of a chasm yawned near. He liked Lydia? He thought Lydia was valuable? Someone worth having her honor defended? Lydia!!?

Knowing what James knew about Lydia in the Biblical sense did not make him the best candidate for being her champion, which is why he surprised himself by snapping at Reza, \"Shut the fuck up!\"

\"It\'s just stupid and foul,\" James said apologetically. \"It has nothing to with Lydia. Reza thinks is funny to make fun of her. It\'s not.\"

Thank God Margaret honked the van horn out in the parking lot to let them know their ride was there. Or James would have found himself in a position of pounding the unlucky Reza into a greasy spot. What was one more demerit in the list of his demerits if Lydia and Lorenzo , an unlikely pair if there was one, remained friends?

\"See you next week,\" Lorenzo raised a hand the size of a meat slab.

\"Sure,\" James said, \"I\'ll say hi to Lydia for you.

It wasn\'t a giant step for mankind, but maybe it was a small step for a man.

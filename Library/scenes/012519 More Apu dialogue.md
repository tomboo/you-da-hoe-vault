Lydia & Margaret

"They're like mortal enemies or something," Lydia said.

"Pakistan and India. I think they're neighbors."

"Different religions. Isn't Reza a Muslim?"

"He doesn't eat pork," said Margaret, thinking of Gretchen's lame vegetarian substitution of a defrosted garden burger every time she threw a pork shoulder into the crockpot and called it "jerked pork."

James to Reza

"Is it better if I call you Brown Boy?" James asked.

"It would be if you were brown," Reza said. "It's OK when my friends say it because they're brown too."

"Sorry. Wrong genes. We're Scandinavian or something."

"Why don't you leave color out of it? Actually, why don't you leave 'boy' out of it too."

"You mean, like, call you by your name?"

"That would be novel," Reza said.

"So call me James, then. Or Olson That's what the guy's on the team call me."

"That's asking a lot. What's your last name, anyway?"

"You'll never be able to spell it. Kamaal-i-aazaad. Seven As.And that's not even a record."

"Are you fucking with me?"

"Always. But that really is my name."

Reza wrote it down on a piece of paer and James counted out the syllables. "So, Reza," he said. "Monkey Boy is easier than that." He gestured to the name that took up an entire line.

"Try Monkey Boy on Josh and see what he says."\
"You know he outweighs me by 40 pounds."

"My point, exactly."

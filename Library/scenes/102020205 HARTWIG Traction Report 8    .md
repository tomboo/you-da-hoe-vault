NEW + GOOD REPORT

After three months of feeling like I was making progress on scene edits/re-drafts, I switched gears and worked on plotting. I thought by locking down plot it would make editing more efficient. My goal was to eliminate scenes or see if I could conflate characters for a more focused narrative. I made progress but also got mired in a feeling of stuckness.

I spent a huge amount of time writing a long form synopsis of almost all the scenes with action and consequences. It helped me see that the story has strong movement and lots of drama. The synopsis work also helped me figure out my chronology better as I am consistently solving ["]{dir="rtl"}this needs to happen before that" issues.

My synopsis document is not the 2-page, short form synopsis that tells the story of the novel in 2 pages. I had been thinking it was a document for me and perhaps my agent: now I see that it might be an addendum to the pitch packet. The long synopsis tells the story at a granular level in about 15 pages. It could become a printed sales piece for book sellers or book store employees and pr/marketing people who need to know the story with a strong flavor of its high action, humor, and stakes. could easily illustrate it to make it more visually interesting. I doubt other novels lend themselves so well for this kind of breakdown.

At the same time as I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been plotting, I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been using my mornings to re-draft emotional, turning points in the most necessary scenes. This is good because it clarifies the stakes and articulates how each character grows or backslides. It[']{dir="rtl"}s bad, because it generates a lot of work to transcribe, which I have been spending hours typing on.

One thing interesting about working with a book coach who I[']{dir="rtl"}m not exactly using to coach me: just the active writing of traction reports is exceptionally helpful. It forces me to reflect on what I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been doing and it shows me that I[']{dir="rtl"}m not exactly stuck. I just need to circle back to all the work I[']{dir="rtl"}ve done and make sure it gets into the manuscript.

Working this way also reinforces in me the knowledge that I do know what I[']{dir="rtl"}m doing. I hope that this knowledge and experience will serve me well on editing my next novel set at the Garden of Eden Serpentarium with a murderous giant reticulated python :-)

I[']{dir="rtl"}ve also spent considerable time on writing in, around, over, even backwards, on the new novel opening chapter. I haven[']{dir="rtl"}t tackled editing the opening into a keeper yet, but I have a very large file of writing to pick and choose from which is strong

TRICKY BITS

What I[']{dir="rtl"}m perseverating about is that I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been working really hard but on so many fronts, it looks like I[']{dir="rtl"}m not making progress. I had a very long and terrible dream about being stuck in the rearrangement task and the dream tells me to return now to finishing individual scenes and perhaps chunks of the novel. I need to console myself with hitting some production goals. By making the mistake of staying too long in the land of continuous revision I am somehow making myself feel like this job will never end.

Rationally, I know that it will end. I will get to the finish line. But at the feeling level, it[']{dir="rtl"}s time to finish pieces so I don[']{dir="rtl"}t feel so enmired.

My synopsis work will be helpful to me as I work on a visual timeline of scenes that I can move around on my wall. But -- I have not done the wall board yet because I don[']{dir="rtl"}t have any index cards and why I don[']{dir="rtl"}t just cut up colored paper -- one color per character -- is a mystery.

FOCUS AND NEXT STEPS

•. I desperately need to update my Scrivener draft with all my edits, rewrites and sentence craft work. This work exists currently in my master files on my computer but I'm causing myself version control problems in the gap between. Scrivener needs to be my current-state-of-the-novel home base.

•. My initial focus on completing each characters arc of-change scene-by-scene was really productive. It feels like it's time to go back to this way of working per character. Once I edit all of the arcs-of-change, I can read the whole and order the book in the way that makes sense. I can[']{dir="rtl"}t see it as a whole right now, so I[']{dir="rtl"}m having trouble locking down the correct order. I will work on Margaret for the next decline.

•. I will work on transitions between scenes after I set the order.

072315 Plot point two planning

Margaret had a stack of insurance forms on her desk that would choke a horse. Jesus. If she was in charge of punishing the asshole who started the blaze at Healing House, she'd make him fill them out. The arson investigator said whoever was responsible wasn't too bright. The "fuel source" appeared to be a waste paper basket filled with dryer lint that had been strategically placed under polyester drapes that went up like a Roman candle. So much for sophisticated planning.

Old Girl was glad they carted Etsy off to Stable before the fire started. She was probably snoring up a Chainsaw Massacre while the fire trucks roared past. Old Girl had never met a person who could slip so deeply into Z-land. It was like she was dead to the world and a nuclear blast wouldn't bother her.

The first week she moved to Young Adults, she was assigned to room with Esty and it was the longest week of her life. She didn't sleep at all for seven days. and it was only when she fell asleep during session with Dr. Hazey that he finally decreed that Esty was banned from having a room mate. If she didn't kill someone first, they would kill her so even though they were packed to the gills in Young Adults, Etsy sleep blissfully alone.

Old Girl hated to admit there were easier ways to go than spending night after zombified night with a snorer. Listening to the big mouth breather rattle, snort, chirr, whistle, whiffle, and then hold her breath for long, tense pauses was enough to give her a tension headache. Just when you thought she had stopped breathing for good, she coughed into life again like a lawn mower engine.

like a light bulb cut off from electricity that flickered and stuttered before it finally blinked on.

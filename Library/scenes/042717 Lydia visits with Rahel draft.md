042717 Lydia\'s visit with her mother

EIGHT

Lydia had fortified herself for her mother's visit with Seven for Mankind jeans, a Miu-Miu blouse and over-the-knee black Ferragamo boots. It was just that in her post donuts, hollowed out, state, she kept having the out-of-body experience of getting smaller until she couldn't feel her weight on the couch.

When it came out that the reason for Rahel's visit was that her mother wanted to take her out of the Program so that she could control Lydia's maintenance allowance and live on her funds until her next divorce settlement came through, Lydia was surprised that her mother put the decision on her. Rahel's carmine nails played with the gold clasp on her Blenciaga bag and Lydia had a vision of being swallowed up by the black braided leather and being turned into a bag shaped block that would be left on the luggage shelf until someone remembered to retrieve her. Leaving the Program would be great. Leaving her mother in the lurch would be even better.

"So I guess you're stuck with me," she told Dr. Hazey as her mother's heels clicked away from her like a radioactive counter.

Hazey turned his back to her. He seemed mesmerized by the only open water that remained unfrozen on Lake Couer D'Alene. The rest of the lake was a white parking lot and ice was relentlessly closing in on a flock of spinning coots that were chuckling and churning circles in the diminishing space.

"That's good. I think." He seemed to be asking a question.

"I thought you'd be happy that you weren't losing my fees," Lydia said.

"I think your mother will be more unhappy at losing your fees than I would be." The slam of the front door gave rise to an ambiguous smile.

"She'll get over it. She always does."

"Hmmm. Is that typical?" Hazey asked.

"What?"

"For your mother to walk out on you?"

"Oh that was mild. The last time I saw her, she called me a little pervert and an ingrate."

"Well, is it unusual for your mother to lose her cool?"

"That wasn't losing her cool. You should see her when she's really mad." Lydia had seen her throw a drinking glass and dislocate a man's shoulder.

"What does she do when she's really mad?"

"I didn't see her for three years from the time I was almost 15 till I was 17."

"Want to tell me about that?"

"Not particularly."

Hazey sighed. He went to the locked file cabinet behind him and rifled through the B's till he found the Bronfmann file. He paged through the bulging sheaves before he found what he was looking for. "It says here that your grandfather charged your mother for lack of supervision for a minor and maintaining an unhealthy environment." The file also said that Rahel Bronfmann's finance had been caught in bed with her daughter by Lydia's nanny.

"So she blamed you for the failure of her marriage?"

"Why do you think she called me an oversexed little ingrate?"

"So she's getting back at you by getting access to your finances?"

"She isn't too good with money, like she said."

"Actually, I think she's pretty darn good with money. She knows how to get it when she needs it."

The coots on the edge of the circle somehow managed to work their way into the inner circle so that the ones on the outside in the cold could depend on getting warm. Lydia wasn't sure how the system worked but sit seemed pretty elegant.

"Just out of curiosity, how big is your monthly allowance?" asked Dr. Hazey.

"It's not called an allowance any more. They changed it to a "maintenance allocation" when I turned 18. It's \$22,000 a month now that I'm technically an adult. Isn't all this stuff in there." She gestured to the file.

"It's news to me that you are actually saving your trust fund by being here."

Lydia blinked. "What's it cost to keep me locked up?"

"\$12,000 a month, give or take."

"What's the take?"

"If we send you to Stabilization, you can add another \$3000 to the total."

"Oh, like an annuity."

Hazey smiled. "Kind of."

After a pause, he asked, "Did you want to have sex with your mother's fiance'?"

"He was a pig. If it meant she wouldn't marry him..."

"That's a lot of responsibility to put on a 14-year-old girl."

"What do you mean?"

"Saving your mother at 14?"

"No, no. By then I was almost 15. She really couldn't see what a dick he was."

"Did you want to hurt her?"

" I was trying to help. She just didn't appreciate it so she stopped talking to me. That's when Grandpa Ben took over custodianship and I went to live in Grosse Point."

Hazey leaned toward her with his hands tented in front of his face. "Lydia, you've been at Inner Horizons more than a year now. How would you characterize your progress?"

"I've been fucked up for 18 years. You don't think you can change me in only a year and a half, do you?"

"Actually, I don't think we can change you at all. You're the only one who can do that."

Lydia went over to the window to contemplate the circling coots. She looked away and caught sight of the large gold wrapped present her mother had left behind. "Can I open my present now? Before she comes back to take it away?"

He waved her ahead and she tore into the shiny foil paper. She made swift work of the clump of silver pine coins and red berries attached to a coil of silver fabric ribbon. In an interior box , she peeled back a nest of snowy white tissue that covered a picture framed in formal gold filigree.

Lydia leaned in to peer at the image. Her stomach lurched sideways.

Lydia's mother was sitting on a yacht in Portofino harbor next to a dark haired man. The man gazed at her in adoration one hand on her thigh. Rahel was looking at the camera in the act of raising a glass of straw-colored champagne .

Lydia knew that photograph. And she knew it had been altered. The original had been taken the day before Rahel and Aldo Fiat were scheduled to get married in Church of St. George . But it wasn't Rahel who was sitting on the pristine white yacht floating on blue Mediterranean water. It had been Lydia sitting next to Aldo on the formed fiberglass bow with the sun setting behind them. Her mother had been behind the camera and she had taken the photo. Now she had somehow excised Lydia from the image as if she hadn't been there.

Aldo squeezed Lydia's adolescent knee in one hairy hand while whispering in her ear, all his attention focused on her. Lydia's 14-year-old hand raised a straw colored glass of ginger ale in the air while her mother's 40 year-old face stared back at the viewer with a knowing smile. A low hum of distress sounded in the room and it took Lydia a second to realize the sound came out of her

Dr. Hazey was watching her. "What's upsetting you about this picture?"

How to describe the happiness of that day without going into all the aftermath when Marlene, her east German nanny, walked in on Aldo thrusting like a piston into her?

"I was there," she said, pointing at the image of her mother. "That's not Rahel, that's me." She put her index finger on the picture, on the place where Aldo was stroking the inside of a thin knee under the fabric of the skirt. She felt the red indentation of those cigar scented fingers. The black hairs that lined the back of his hands which were sparser than the black hairs that coiled around his groin

Hazey's eye brows knotted with puzzlement as he tried to parse what she was saying. "You mean you were there when the picture was taken?"

"Yes. I was. I mean... no. I was sitting where she is. Mom was taking the picture and Aldo was sitting next to me with his hand on my knee." She stabbed at the large, sausage shaped fingers and looked away from Hazey.

"Mom had the photo retouched to get rid of me."

She had always liked Aldo. He was fun and funny, always joking around with the yacht boys and the masseuse and masseur and telling them all dirty jokes that were too old for her in his Italian-accented English. It bewildered he when she woke up to him lying on top of her, kissing her breasts and forcing her legs apart with his knee. She screamed when he started poking at her. It hurt like fire and it felt like he was both suffocating her with his weight and splitting her in two and it was the noises she made to defend herself, even as Aldo pressed one hairy hand over her mouth and hissed at her to take what he she'd been begging for, that woke up Marlene, the nanny, asleep in the next room.

"That's my leg, can't you tell? Look how skinny it is."

Hazey leaned closer and she heard his intake of breath when he saw the adolescent thigh.

"Why would your mother give this to you for your birthday?"

Therapists! Sometimes you had to do all the work because they were just too damn stupid to see what was right in their face.

Lydia shrugged. "Now you can't even tell I was with them."

The raised glass of pale bubbles. Aldo's laughing eyes. The delirious regard for the woman who's skirt he was pushing his hand under. Oh, to have never existed on that day the way her mother wanted.

"Your mother is a sick woman," Hazey said. "I hope you see that."

"She may be sick but I'm the one who's missing."

"You're here now," he said. "You don't ever have to be in that position again."

Lydia was already closing up the white nest of tissue in order to cover up the image.

"You're right," she said. "I doubt my Grandfather will ever let me live with her again."

"What about you, Lydia. Do you want to live with your mother?"

She turned hopeless eyes toward the churning birds that were spinning in the hole that was growing smaller by the freezing, flake-filled minute.. "Not today. But most days. Crazy, huh?"

"Understandable," Hazey said. "I''m not surprised."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

Lydia finally asked the one question she'd been wanting to ask for years. "Dr. Hazey, is she crazy or am I?"

"Yes," he said.

"Damn. I was afraid of that."

Her last question was one she'd thought about off-and-on for years, whenever she decided she was making progress in therapy and felt briefly optimistic. "Could you fix her if you worked with her?"

"You mean, if your mother was my patient? If I worked with her in therapy?"

"I know it's never going to happen.... But\--?"

"I don't fix people, Lydia. No therapist does."

"Well, what good are you?"

Dr. Hazey's expression was sober, as if he were thinking about the fucked up relationship between mother and daughter and unhappy with his conclusion.

"I didn't say therapy wasn't helpful. All I said was that change is up to the individual."

"So you must work with a lot of patients who can't change. Doesn't that make you feel like a failure?"

He rolled his eyes. "Out of the mouths of babes," he muttered, under his breath.

He ended by saying that he would bring Darlene up to speed on Rahel's visit this afternoon. "No doubt you'll be revisiting this conversation for some time."

For no reason, one of Aldo's hoary old jokes came back to her like a ghost. "Dr. Hazey, do you happen to know the definition of eternity?"

"Can't say I do."

"Two people, a ham and their relationship with their mother."

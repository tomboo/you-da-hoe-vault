08092025 Accountability Whip Concept for BookTok video

An array of whips and fly swatters ranging from a small flicker to a full length long leather horsehide whip laid out in front of Cynthia on a table top. Cynthia addresses camera and talks about how every writer has to figure out how to make oneself accountable. Talk about my personal experience of hiring a Book Coach who's real role is to set deadlines and crack the whip of persuasion over one's head in any way that will get you to obey it.

Cynthia's hand could hover over the small little flicker whisk if she's having a good week. Or if it's a bad week and the devil sits on her shoulder and tells her to eat candy and fuck off, there's always something in a book coach's lineup that is more persuasive. Camera lands on a close up of the long leather whip used by the Raiders of the Lost Ark assassin whom Harrison Ford has to shoot when he has the flu.

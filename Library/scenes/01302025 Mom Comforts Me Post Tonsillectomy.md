01302025 Mom Comfort Me After Tonsillectomy

A nurse bought me popsicles in bed which I had been looking forward to. Mom probably told me how great it was going to be to have popsicles whenever I wanted.

I came to from surgery on my tonsils feeling like there was a fire in my throat so bright and hot It felt like it was eating me from the inside out.

The nurse offered me a popsicle but it might a we'll have been dust in a parched desert because I waved it off. Too many flames.

Mom appeared out of nowhere behind the nurse.

I thought I was a big girl. Hadn't cried in years, though I was maybe 12 or 13 the day of the surgery. All the trauma from Dad was bottled up tight, so I thought. I tried to speak to her but I couldn't get out any words, it hurt so much. "It hurts," came out like a croak that I didn't recognize as my own voice.

She held me. Enclosed me in her arms, pillowing my head in the crook of her neck, her big breasts solid and soft, with a familiar smell which I'd forgotten I knew. She patted my back while tears ran freely down my face from the pain. I was embarrassed and ashamed to be such a big baby but she didn't ay a word. She held me and rocked me and I was so glad she was there, it felt like home and safety. It was OK to cry. He seemed to understand in her unusual silence from a woman who talked all the time that it was OK to, she was there.

It's hard to describe the relief I felt. She was there. That was enough though the flames didn't dissipate. It was bearable with her arms around me and my tears wetting her neck.

It ha to be pre-language I was feeling, the comfort of my mother when I thought I was well past needing it.

010219 Rusty remembers the belt

The old man beat him once with a dried out switch instead of the green willow switches he liked. The old wood broke over Rusty's back and the old man was so mad, he shouted, "You're such a knothead even wood ain't strong enough to teach you a lesson." He was unable to even look at a belt after that.

Helga, when she lived to home, was always asking him, "Whyn't you take care of yourself? Pull your pants up," or "Who wantsa look at your crack?" When the old man died in his own bed, Rusty put a match to him and his every belt and burned the memory of the burning switch into ash.

"You have it," he mumbled. "Spent a lotta time on it."

OG wasn't sure what the man wanted her to do with the strange mangled thing. If she took the doll like he seemed to want her to, she'd have to leave him and he was adamant about not being alone.

He gripped her fingers hard while blood drip-drip-dripped down the steering column somewhere onto on his feet.

"You're pretty," he said at one point. "Not as pretty as her."

She thinks he's talking about his wife or someone who loves him. Could anyone love this filthy garbage dump of a man. It's the reminder of garbage dump that makes her realize she knows this guy. He's the one who picks up trash for the Program.

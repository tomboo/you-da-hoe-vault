08092025 Book Tok Whip video

Cynthia shot head on behind a table with a wide assortment of whips ranging fro fly-swatter small to the very long leather whip that Harrison Ford cracked in Raiders of the Lost Ark. The camera pans across the whip array as Cynthia's hand picks up and tests one mean implement over one or another. She ends up picking the big leather whip and not being able to get a satisfactory crack.

VO: Every writer has to figure out a million times in their career "what do I need now?" After being stuck on where to go with my novel for eons, it became obvious that I need the whip of a deadline to get me rolling again. Once my lifelong habit of meeting deadlines in my advertising career kicked in, I was back in the traces with someone else cracking thunder over my head. Yes, i's a little embarrassing to need to be threatened. It's also totally exhilarating. Pretty sure they say the same thing about BDSM, but hey, a book coach costs a lot less than that.

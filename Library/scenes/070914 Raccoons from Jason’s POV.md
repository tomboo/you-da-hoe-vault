**Chase**

A big-assed woman in a gray sweatshirt that read "Don't Mess with Mom" met Chase Mortimer at the door of an ordinary ranch house.

"Margaret, here," she said. "And you\-- you're the newest addition to Healing House?" To Chase's ears, she sounded ironic, like he'd just won the Lottery but she was going to keep the winnings.

Thankfully, he'd managed to stash one last snort of cocaine beneath the insole of his Nikes. When Margaret left him in the homey living room "to get some forms," he burned rubber to get to the powder room with a big weird tub.

Nineteen hours before, two unsmiling men with matching NRA tie-pins had dragooned Chase away from his dorm room in Middlebury, Vermont. He was at the end of a three-day drug and booze fest that had been preceded by months of an upsy-down-daisy-chain of 'luuds and amphetamines i.e. freshman year at Bard College as he was enjoying it.

Matthias, the wiry, tense escort with a crew-cut, had strip-searched Chase down to his socks and underwear while Aldus, the fat one who popped Mentos like a chain smoker, packed his duffle bag. Neither one had the balls to stick their nose into Chases' running shoes, hence the heartfelt Hallelujah Chorus Chase was humming as he shook out a thin line of white powder on the counter top.

Chase bent to the line the way a man dying of hunger bends to an all-u-can-eat buffet. He Hoovered up a sustaining snort and then paused, regretting that this was the last of his stash, not wanting to think too hard about how the hell he was going to replace it in the middle of fucked-up Idaho where his fucking parents had locked him up at a fucking psychiatric treatment program designed to keep him from fucking around.

The drug fiesta drain had been draining out of his blood stream for the past couple of hours. He needed the white line not so much as to get high but to stay as-is, or at least able to maintain. A movement beyond a small square window in the wall interrupted the next snort.

A furry, feral creature with a black mask was staring at him through the glass with a look of disapproval. Chase's heart rate was already rocketing---it was good New Jersey shit, .he'd stolen it from his dealer before the stingy shit had a chance to cut it. What? Chase wanted to ask the fur ball. What do you know that I don't?

The creature had a sizeable gray ruff. Black bands that circled its body. A bushy black-and-white striped tail floated over its raised back like a warning flag. It stood eye level with him, a yellow grapefruit perched like a beanie on its head.

Chase had only snorted a tiny squiff. Three quarters of the line remained. One part of his brain registered judgment in the beady black eyes while the rest of his brain cells took in the pointed muzzle, black-tipped and moist, and gray fingers the size of elf hands. The creature lifted the grapefruit rind off its head and held it up to Chase like a chalice.

As it nibbled daintily at the fruit, the raccoon looked so much like Chase's mother, his heart stuttered into quick-time. For an instant, he wondered if perhaps it was a good thing he was in Idaho at a treatment center if he was going to be visited by a grapefruit-eating mother who seemed to have turned herself into a raccoon. This thought was pushed away by the sight of a fat snarling raccoon looming behind the grapefruit eater with a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth.

Chase heard a yowl that reminded him of two 'hos he'd seen fighting in a dispute over a john in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. The grapefruit flew. A moil of striped fur and white-and-black tails and slashing claws broke out as two raccoons turned into one hellish circle of fur and teeth.

He sneezed through his abused sinuses and dimly registered the spray of red mist that dotted the oak counter top like a rash. It felt like he'd been snorting sand and his heart rate was on triple time.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Loud raps shook the door. "Yo! You OK in there? Need help?" A woman's voice seemed to occupy the whole powder room.

"Uhhhh..." He paused. "Is it me.... Or is there a cat fight outside?"

The woman---the name Margaret seemed to reach him from a faraway place\--sucked in a deep, indignant breath. "Son of a bitch!" she cried. "Those little motherfuckers!"

By the time Chase finally got himself out of the bathroom, he wandered the living room and dining room, and then peeked down a hall of closed doors, expecting the big woman to be up in his grill about how long he'd been in the john. Strangely, the living area, which seemed occupied by way too many couches, was empty and silent as a church.

Chase walked over to a big window and watched half a dozen raccoons milling around and snuffling amongst a mess of overturned garbage cans in a snowy driveway.

It seemed the fur ball fight was over. A baby-sized raccoon teetered on the rim of one bin, then dropped abruptly into its dark maw. A burly raccoon with a fat ringed tail bobbed up from the depths with its head embedded in a yogurt container.

Chase tried to shake off the feeling that his heart was going to carry off his body. He was aware that raccoons were a normal phenomenon in the American west. He'd seen them in alleys on Manhattan's upper Eastside where Mom and Dad lived in a brown stone between an investment banker and a seat holder on the New York Stock Exchange. Get me out of here, he was thinking, at the sight of big-assed Margaret stomping past the window with a big-ass shotgun raised to a big-ass shoulder.

She looked like Annie Oakley in knee-high boots. Rifle stock pressed to an eye socket, meaty finger pumping the trigger.

It was one thing to go from a cute masked critter that looked like his mother wearing a grapefruit on its head to the same masked creature's head flying into red and gray mist from the force of a large bore rifle.

When Chase uncovered his eyes, he saw no signs of life. No tails. No tiny ashen fingers. Just a limp, gray carcass amid salad slime and crumpled newspapers and coffee grounds strewn around the driveway like the end of a Mexican-themed frat party.

Chase sank to a couch, chest banging in his throat. He no longer had a heartbeat. He felt like his head was being jackhammered until a burst of light split his brain wide open like a rotten canteloupe.

By the time Margaret got back to the living room, she found the new kid---Jason? Chasen?\-- passed out on a couch. She couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with him.

One minute she was w standing around waiting for him to finish in the bathroom so she could explain the house rules and then she'd had to run outside to chase off those fucking raccoon who'd gotten into the garbage again before Hazey arrived with the Certification Review Team. She'd have done anything to avoid Hazey's shit fit; he'd already declared on jihad on the coons. The kid had seemed fine when he went to the bathroom, hung over, maybe a little strung out, just like every other kid who came escorted to the program.

At first, she thought he was asleep. She'd watched his chest for a minute, expecting to see it rise and fall. Instead, a pulse jumped erratically in his throat like a live wire. His pulse rate was so high, she could barely count it. She flipped the kid up to sitting and forced his head down between his knees, holding him down to level out his bloodpressure while she speed-dialed 9-1-1. Shit in a shoe! Hazey didn't pay her enough to let a kid barely out of high school die on the couch of heart failure.

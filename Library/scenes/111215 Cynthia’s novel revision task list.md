111215 Cynthia's novel revision task list

**My Intention**

I'm trying to write a novel about adolescents on a growth or maturity trajectory who have the common problem of needing to grow up enough to get themselves unstuck from tragedy, grief, loss or their own bad behavior. This is a novel about a place/Program that's supposed to help these kids with therapy & DBT & CBT & SSRIs & biofeedback & Jungian dream analysis & thousands of hours of talk therapy when whatever change they make has to be self-directed with the tools of human connection and concern for others.

Margaret plans to extort health care benefits, a raise and a new job out of Hazey to solve her financial pressure.

Dr. Hazey plans to get Inner Horizons certified, expand his empire to make more money, and hire a COO so he can reign from somewhere warm, preferably Tahiti or Fiji or Samoa.

James plans to go back to California and play basketball for UCSD as a walk on. While in Idaho, he'll settle for playing b-ball at NICC.

Lydia feels panic every time she thinks about planning for the future. All she can think of is her sexual itch and getting it scratched. She needs to have a relationship without sex that's based on give-and-take.

Rachel plans to find something to replace the emptiness of the baby who's been taken away. She plans to befriend OG and is surprised by her growing friendship with James.

Cynthia's Revision List

1.  Address the time confusion and make the clock clear to the reader.

Create a chronology that locks all the events on a time line.

**Today**: 8 am -- midnight of a Monday, late in January, 2014

**Before**: events starting in December and running through late January until day of inciting incident

**Tomorrow**: 12 midnight of Tuesday -- 9 AM after OG runs

2.  Rethink plotting to increase tension and plant character's plans early on to ratchet up suspense

> \--OG's decision to run
>
> \--Margaret's plan to extort a raise/new job from Hazey
>
> \--Hazey's plan to get certified & expand so he can hire new COO and run

3.  Cut Margaret's segments to give her less time on stage

4.  Address Lydia & Lorenzo relationship to figure out why it isn't working; think through how to make it push plot forward

5.  Figure out how to handle backstory more elegantly or cut it

6.  Make clear Rachel is 17 when she has a baby that's removed from adoption

7.  Readdress how the Middle unfolds to address episodic concerns that aren't rising in causality & tension

8.  Address snarky voice issue: ask Peter how to address a voice issue that's me at bedrock

9.  Think about how fire affects plot in its aftermath. Make it a cause-and-effect cascade

10. Integrate Review Board/certification process into the plot. Another cause-and-effect driver

11. Look at raccoon in fire scene and figure out how to clarify the owl that steals OG's hat

12. Look for inconsistencies in OG & Rachel's roommate status & other time inconsistencies that confuse reader

13. Think about consolidating a character to simplify. Immediate thought is to rethink Rachel as a separate voice.

14. Research current drug and weed use. Try all.

Thank you list

Jack Remick and Bob Ray for teaching me structure and how to deepen the vein

Priscilla Long for craft and sentencing and paying attention to language and truth

Peter Mountford, for telling me to rethink Lydia's character to get her right

Monica Lyall for reading and telling me to get it done. I was listening. I just couldn't figure out how to get it done for lo, these many years

Tom Booster, my long suffering and rock of a husband: I really was working on my novel.

Random thank you's are necessary for "borrowings." These are gifts from the universe that I've overheard on the bus or said in jest and realized they had a place in my novel.

Barbara Thomas: "If you live long enough, you'll see everything twice." This may have come from Grady, but I still remember you saying it back when we were working together on Bumbershoot.

My mother, Mary Louis Hartwig, on whom Margaret is based. The price of cottage cheese and toilet paper on sale turned out to be important to me long after you were gone. The pajamas we buried you in feature heavily in Margaret's last scene.

Nick, my darling and most treasured boy: "Madeleine is like a feral creature, sometimes you have to sneak up on her or she'll bolt."

Madeleine, my beloved and most treasured girl: for living through it and for all your help explaining how it worked

Nina: "Shit in a shoe!" and much writing discussion that's taught me about both writing and the value of friendship.

Dr. Arnold Weinstein's Great Courses from the Teaching Company on the novel and American Literature. You have no idea what you taught me. I am truly one of your most grateful and attentive students. I wish you would grant me an honorary MFA in my Car.

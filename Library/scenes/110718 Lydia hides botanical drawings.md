110718 Lydia hides botanical drawings

Rachel wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t buying it. She was sitting next to Old Girl and she leaned over and whispered in her ear. Then Old Girl was looking at her funny too. ["]{dir="rtl"}I was with you the night of the fire," Rachel said, her tone belligerent. ["]{dir="rtl"}You weren[']{dir="rtl"}t wearing boots, you were wearing Chuck Taylors."

["]{dir="rtl"}What? Now you[']{dir="rtl"}re the fashion police?" Lydia said. ["]{dir="rtl"}You think I[']{dir="rtl"}d wreck these boots in the snow?"

Lydia bared her teeth at her to get her to back off but Rachel looked mulish until Darlene shushed them both with a wave of her hand.

["]{dir="rtl"}We already know about Old Girl[']{dir="rtl"}s hat," Darlene said. ["]{dir="rtl"}Is it OK to skip you since we[']{dir="rtl"}re out of time?"

Doh! Old Girl waved Darlene off like royalty. Noblesse oblige and the horse you rode in on, and all that.

The room cleared. On her way past Rachel, Lydia clutched the Ferragamo[']{dir="rtl"}s in her arm pit and kept the sketchbook hidden by the monkey fucker pillow. Rachel knew exactly how cold she had been when she got under the blanket with her and James. And where would she have hidden the boots that night? It wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t like they would have fit in her thong.

Silence is golden, she thought. Or is it platinum when you[']{dir="rtl"}re stuck in a Program?

Gracie had copied all the drawings at the end of the trip. Made her sign them. Got an official permission slip for her to use them in her paper and made Lydia sign that too. At fourteen, she had never felt so elevated. As if she was somebody, or at least could be somebody, of worth.

She thought she[']{dir="rtl"}d escaped but in the hallway, Rachels long-legged steps sounded behind her. Being short sucked.

["]{dir="rtl"}What[']{dir="rtl"}s the deal, Lydia?" Rachel said. ["]{dir="rtl"}Can[']{dir="rtl"}t you ever be honest, even to yourself? I was nice to you!"

["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t know what you[']{dir="rtl"}re talking about."

["]{dir="rtl"}You don[']{dir="rtl"}t give a shit about those boots."

["]{dir="rtl"}How do you know?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Because you[']{dir="rtl"}re hiding a drawing book under that pillow?"

Lydia turned to glare at Rachel. ["]{dir="rtl"}What[']{dir="rtl"}s it to you?"

["]{dir="rtl"}The question is, what[']{dir="rtl"}s *that* to you." Rachel gestured to the notebook Lydia was holding flat against the pillow so it couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t be seen.

When Lydia said nothing, an expression of hurt flitted across Rachel[']{dir="rtl"}s face. Then the girl brushed past her in the hall and shut the door to her room in Lydia[']{dir="rtl"}s face.

What do you care? Lydia wanted to pound on her door and shout. Instead she threw the Ferragamos against the wall in the closet with a boom. Fuck the boot savers. Let them wrinkle, that[']{dir="rtl"}s how much I care, she told herself, as she tucked the sketch book back in the trunk under a bunch of summer clothes.

It turned out the fire was contained in the laundry room. Old Girl smelled it first because her and Rachel[']{dir="rtl"}s room shared a wall with the washer. So after a lot of stomping around and crawling through the crawl space and checking of the roof, the head of the volunteer fire department gathered them together and said they could go back inside, as long as they shut the fire doors and closed off the girl[']{dir="rtl"}s hall. Tomorrow they[']{dir="rtl"}d bring in a clean-up crew and assess the damage in the morning.

That meant they were finally herded back into Healing House at 2 AM. The boys got to go back to their rooms and Charlene passed out sleeping bags and pads from the hiking closet to the girls. She played it like it was going to be an exciting sleep over while they all bedded down in the living room. Even Estie wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t dumb enough to buy that.

110918 Getting from fire to sleep over

The fire turned out to like most of life at Healing House. Ten minutes of excitement and a lot of standing around and freezing under the Fire Chief declared the flames officially out. The fire had been contained in the laundry room. Most of the damage was smoke damage, the washer and dryer still worked, though they were slightly melted on the side where the flames ate the curtains.

The paunchy Fire Chief praised Charlene who turned out to be his cousin. He patted her on the back and talked about how ["]{dir="rtl"}this little gal" got everybody out safe as if Old Girl hadn[']{dir="rtl"}t woken her from a dead sleep on the couch, one hand still clutching a potato chip.

They opened all the windows in the girl[']{dir="rtl"}s rooms to air out the smoke. Charlene had been smart enough to shut the fire doors so the smoke was limited mostly to the girl[']{dir="rtl"}s wing. For that, she got a smooch from Chief Robeson who turned out to be an uncle or maybe a cousin on the non-deadbeat side of her family.

After that the boy[']{dir="rtl"}s went back to their rooms and the girl[']{dir="rtl"}s got handed sleeping bags and pads that Charlene broke out of the hiking closet. Then all sixteen of them bedded down in the living room on the floor except for the lucky ones who commandeered the couches. It was impossible for OG to sleep after her adrenalin rush.

The Fire Chief or Marshal or Maven, didn[']{dir="rtl"}t say squat about what the firefighters were all muttering about between themselves. But Reza, Chief Snitch, overheard the word ["]{dir="rtl"}arson" and that went through the Program ranks like wild fire. Old Girl wished heartily he[']{dir="rtl"}d kept that info to himself until morning because all she could think of was the smell of smoke that had been in her nostrils and how she[']{dir="rtl"}d nearly ignored it and turned over to go back to sleep instead of rousing everybody to get the hell out. Who in hell would care to burn up a household of crazy kids? She wondered. Didn[']{dir="rtl"}t they know that the crazies would eat their own if left long enough to their own devices?

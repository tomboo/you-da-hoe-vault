052514 Healing House Setting

Other homes in Hazey's psychiatric universe were sprinkled throughout Couer D'Aene. "Hiding in plain sight," the TV announcer voice from a reality cop show came to Margaret's mind.

Hazey had gotten a deal on a bunch of oak antiques. "Isn't wood homey?!!" Hazey's wife Beverly had cried when she'd given Margaret her first tour. Now that Beverly had left Hazey and gone home to Normal, Illinois, they were left with bland, institutional and homey oak.

You couldn't have curios or knick-knacks or anything too easy to throw around which cut down on dusting, Margaret had to admit. It also cut down on personality. Healing House had the air of masquerading as a home but no one in their right mind would read it as homey. It had been decorated in tasteful taupes and umber and ochre, all decorator colors, which were chosen to communicate warmth and calm. Really it just looked boring with its institutional sameness. Homey where nobody wanted to live.

A modified ranch house with two wings that had been added on to in order to accommodate 12 boys and 12 girls in double rooms on each ell.

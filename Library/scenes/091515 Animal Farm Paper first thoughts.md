091515 Animal Farm Paper first thoughts

Old Girl's Animal Farm paper was supposed to be ten pages. It could be on a theme or their own choosing or it could be the one that Professor Larson had given them which was to an allegory between a current event and the events in Animal Farm using George Orwell's characters.

She had read Animal Farm long before she entered the Program. She didn't like the story then and she didn't like it when she read it again. What bothered her about it was how stupid the farm animals were in the face of tyranny. Why didn't they act in their own behalf?

Old Girl hadn't chosen a theme yet and to be honest, she didn't know crap about current events. She supposed she could make an argument for writing the paper on what happened every day in a nut house. What would it be like if Dr. Hazey, whom she tolerated and occasionally liked, got thrown out by Darlene who sometimes acted like a little Napoleon?

Margaret would definitely be Boxer, the overworked horse. The woman was as strong as a Clydesdale and actually, now that she thought about it, a smile that looked kind of horsey because it was obvious she'd never visited an orthodontist. Maybe braces didn't exist when she was a kid.

Hazey wasn't exactly power mad; he was just a weak leader and people like Gretchen and occasionally Darlene acted on his behalf when it was really their own agenda they followed and he didn't seem to notice. Maybe Hazey was the equivalent of the Tsar of Russia, so out-of-touch and bumbling and intent on overworking his many serfs, he needed to be replaced. But who would want to run a nut house, really? Especially when it was more pain than it was worth.

The paper was one of those assignments that was supposed to prove to the Professor you'd read the book and you got how a fable worked. You were supposed to create your own allegory using events from real life like Orwell had used the rise of Communism in 1917 as a structure for his story. You had the freedom to pick some world event, like the repression of the Syrian people or what was happening to the Rohinga people in Myanmar. She said you could even reach way back in history if you wanted to. You could make a fable about how the slaves were persecuted after they were supposedly freed by ithe Civil War. The old plantation owner could be Tsar Nicholas and state legislators could be a bunch of power-hungry pigs like Snowball and Napoleon and the rabble-rousing papers of the day could be a newspaper editor named Squealer and so on.

The thing was Old Girl wasn't interested in current events and hadn't read a newspaper for years. There was no TV at Healing House, so how was she supposed to catch up on the evening news. No access to the Internet so you couldn't even look up the headlines on MSN.com. If she hadn't put off the deadline till the last minute---the damn paper was due tomorrow---she could have holed up in the library and done some last minute research. The snow day put a damper on that plan. Anything she made an allegory out of had to be a story she knew intimately. That's how she got to the idea to assign roles at the Animal House that was Inner Horizons.

Boxer, the overworked horse, was easy. That was Margaret. The woman was built like a Clydesdale and she never stopped working. If she'd ever gone to an orthodontist, you'd never know it because her overbite was terrible. It wasn't a stretch to say that she looked like a plow horse from behind and her laugh was definitely horsey.

On the farm, Sugar Candy Mountain was supposed to be heaven, something that pacified the masses. She could make a case for Outside or Where You Ended Up When You Ran as their own version of an unrealistic paradise. If you listened to the kids who were constantly making plans to escape, they made it sound like got to eat ice cream and steak when you were Outside and all the money you needed for food or clothes or a place to sleep somehow magically ended up in your wallet. Police didn't exist and neither did pimps and gangs who would roll you just for fun.

Paper Topics

You were supposed to place all the characters from the farm into a setting of your choosing and explain how they worked in your allegorical world. Professor Larson used the example of Myanmar 's an old repressive military regime could be a stand-in for Orwell's Manor House and then you could show that the country's new regime which was not that different from the old crappy one, could be the new Animal Farm. The Rohinga refugees that were escaping from Bangalore---or was it Bangladesh---would be the sheep and so on. It was a whole lot easier if you knew the real situation which Old Girl didn't because Inner Horizons didn't believe in letting you read the newspaper or watch TV.

Ir wouldn't have been so difficult to write the stupid Animal House paper if Old Girl had been able to go the library like she planned. Fucking snow day. It would have been a cakewalk to write the paper on Lord of the Flies. All she had to do was write down the bullshit that went down all day in the living room.

At Jon\'s request, I met at his house yesterday to talk about the Board of

Advisor meeting and the lack of a business model that will convince

VCs to fund us.

It was a good conversation but weird. Jon is lonely. My perception is

that he wants a \"friend\" at the company. He seems to want to both kick

Axon for not knowing how to solve a very hard question and at same time, he wants to be seen as a the \"king maker\"  if we succeed. 

His weird master-slave relationship with Kroese is more active than I thought: he said he has met repeatedly with Mark and Andrew over the past couple of

months He showed me about 16 emails to/from Mark with dates/scheduled meetings on his computer that went back to March 2016. He also gave me copy of his most recent follow-up memo of substantive questions he thinks we need to answer to find a path forward in our goal of persuading VCs to fund the company in next round. (BTW, he smacked me on the nose for calling the next round of funding \"Series A.\"  \"You only use the term \'Series A\' post-revenue, Cynthia, you nimrod. Don\'t you know that??? You\'re raising Seed 2 or 3 not A!\" Once smacked by Lazarus, you never forget it.)

He STILL feels aggrieved that he hasn\'t been compensated for his consulting time and says he has told Mark repeatedly that he won\'t sign his stock option agreement, though he also seems desirous of being on our Board of Advisors. I have attached PDF 1 which is a copy of the email thread between Jon & Mark that is a record of Jon\'s non-agreement to the proposed compensation. I thought this was completed quite a while ago.

PDF 2 is a memo from Jon to Mark dated April 23 which points out \"there are core components of your pitch that are missing: notably a product plan and projections that will support the valuations that we have discussed.\" He says he has asked repeatedly for a business case and revenue projections and that Mark\'s answer is \"We\'re working on it.\"

PDF 3 is a copy of Jon\'s feedback memo to Mark post BOA meeting; it was written Friday, 5/25/17 by Jon and represents all the questions we have to answer before we can approach VCs for funding. 

The PDF3 memo is very clear-headed, non-toxic,  thoughtful. I am convinced that the best way to use John\'s big brain is to ask him to respond in writing because he is able to get himself and his negativity off-stage and he is both strong and articulate in his thinking. If he were a more positive & less toxic person, we could lock him up and get him to write a business case and it would likely be good. (Wishful thinking.)

My take is that we should use Jon\'s feedback, along with the BOA attendee feedback, and my recent phone conversation with Serena Glover re Mark\'s buy-back offer as three separate data points. As in focus group conversations, we should look for the common themes, the repetition of negatives and issues that all three entities raise, and not get hung up on the mean or hard-to-swallow criticisms. 

I need to walk you both through my Serena/Sarah notes from my conversation April 29. It\'s substantive critique though hard to hear. Serena has repeatedly offered to meet with me and Jake and she is willing to bring Zagula into the discussion. She thinks that it would help Jake to hear directly from 2 people who are strategic thinkers and understand where their perceptions of looming  problems is coming from.

There are real common themes here about Axon\'s leadership, Board governance, missing skill sets, and the very real concern that we are going to run out of money. Time to figure out how we\'re going to build a financial case for our technology and get the right people in the mix to help us.

I\'d really like to be part of this discussion, not that I have the answers, but because I am a passionate advocate for Jake, the company, and like you two, Tom and I have a lot of skin in this game :-)  You can fault me for style but boy, you can\'t fault me for willingness to knuckle down and help.

PS Jake, I didn\'t call you back yesterday because after Jon\'s bludgeoning, I slept for 4 hours, then promptly went back to bed. I\'m healing from my platelet treatment so off my game.

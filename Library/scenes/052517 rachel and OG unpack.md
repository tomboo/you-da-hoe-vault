052517 OG and Rachel unpack

\"What are you doing?\" Rachel asked.

She was busy folding her clothes in neat piles and stacking them in the dresser on her side of the room. Old Girl was doing something similar: she was taking crap out of her drawers and dumping the stuff she didn\'t want into a big pile for Good Will and stacking the small number of items she needed in her new life on the bed. \"Spring cleaning,\" she said, semi-truthfully. It was technically winter but she was cleaning. Out the old, in with the new and all that.

The stuff she was taking was ragged and worn thin, just random stuff she couldn\'t bear to part with: Gave\'s puppy hat with the hang dog ears, a couple of tee shirts, three pairs of ratty underwear, a pair of jeans. The throw-away pile was growing on the floor of the closet. Really when she thought about it, where she was going she wasn\'t going to need much. Dead people don\'t need to change their underpants. She dropped a particularly holey pair with a stretched out waistband. Rag bag and good riddance.

Rachel was looking kind of harried and frustrated. She\'d been moving steadily back and forth between the suitcase and the closet or dresser. She shook out blouses and skirts, a few dresses, and methodically hung them up.

\"What\'s the matter?\"

\"Ran out of hangers. Do you have any more?\"

\"Sure. Old Girl grabbed a shirt from the rack that was going on the \"leave\" pile and liberated it from the wire. Then she yanked three or four more things and handed off all the hangers she could free.

Rachel said, \"That looks like more than spring cleaning. That looks like you\'re throwing out the baby and the bath water.\" She was eying the growing mound of throwaways on Old Girl\'s side of the room. Everything that was going in her pack was on the bed.

Blithely, Old Girl waved her off. \"I\'m just making room for you,\" she lied. As soon as they figured out that she was gone for good, they would bring her nearly empty trunk up from storage and ship all this crap back to Pegg and David when they closed her account. The least she could do was get rid of it before Peggy had to cry over it.

Questions were written all over Rachel\'s face. She thanked her for the hangers, saying, \"You\'d think they\'d just go out and buy us some more. It\'s not like they cost a lot.\"

\"They\'re on a hanger diet,\" Old Girl said.

\"What\'s that.\"

\"They don\'t want anybody to overdose on them. Bad for their reputation.\"

Rachel snorted, cracking a small smile. \"You are a nut. Certifiable.\"

\"No, not certified. You don\'t get that till they send you out of here on a slab.\"

\"Good to know.\"

By the time Med Check was called, Rachel\'s side of the room looked homey and comfortable, as if she\'d lived there for years. Old Girl looked like she\'d never set foot in the room.

\"You must have a lot of stuff in your trunk to replace what you\'re throwing away,\" Rachel said.

\"You can\'t imagine,\" was Old Girl\'s reply.

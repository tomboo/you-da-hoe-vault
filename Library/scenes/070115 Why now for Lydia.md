070115 Why now for Lydia

Lydia's mother was on her way. It was imperative that she fill herself up before she leaked out all over the witch.

Lydia was always proving to her mother how together she was. How she was dressed, what purse she carried (tasteful Balenciaga or reserved, chic Chanel) with \$700 jeans and Miu-Miu shoes were an uncomplicated language they both understood. Perhaps they spoke the language of dress because there was nothing else to say.

Rahel Bronfman Fiat soon to be ex-Fiat whenever her third divorce came through, air-kissed Lydia on both cheeks. It occurred to Lydia that maybe her mother missed her cheeks by an inch because either she truly wasn't there.

"You look so pretty dear! Your hair..." A flitter of eyebrows told Lydia she hated that she had to stop straightening it when a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho couldn't be found. "So informal and free." Translation: messy and rustic enough to merit jail time in any other state.

If her mother brought her nostrils any higher, Lydia made up her mind to rip off her false eyelashes and shove them up her nose. There were two nostrils weren't there? Two roads to hell.

In two hours---one hour and 46 minutes, according to Lydia's Piaget watch---Lydia's mother was going to wreak havoc on her fragile equilibrium. If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart. She checked to make sure the \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse was still in her back pocket. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black nails and change over to a tasteful French manicure with perfect white crescents. The same manicure would have cost her \$50 bucks in New York so for today, she considered herself lucky to be in Idaho. If she'd known the witch was coming for a visit, she never would have gone Goth Girl. She made a note to remember to hide the cheap-ass Betsey Johnson knock-off tote in plain sight on Esty's side of the room. Her mother had a thing about carrying a fake. "You and I know what's real," she liked to say.

You could hide from her but you couldn't run from her. Even in her Jimmy Choos, Mom was faster than Lydia wearing Nikes. She was a fitness fanatic. That's how she stayed so tiny and she was always nagging Lydia to lose weight. Gaining two pounds on the Bronfman scale was to voluntarily commit social suicide. What man would want you if you were fat? The first thing Lydia would do after Rahel took off on the Lear jet was run down to Dunkin' Donuts and stuff herself with every cake donut and cruller on the shelf. She'd imagine her mother watching her from five thousand feet up scarfing donut after donut until she couldn't stuff in another bite. Then she'd open her mouth wide and vomit everything into the maw of the purse she left behind. That's what I think of your stinking birthday present, Mom. Blap.

**Self Portrait**

Lydia was a tiny, bird-boned girl with curly dark hair and a hooked nose that she absolutely refused to straighten no matter how much her mother threatened her. It was a Jewish nose; what would you expect with a name like Bronfman? She weighed 103 pounds and the heaviest she\'d ever been was 106 pounds which she considered obese. If she saw the dreaded number, she would throw up everything she put in her mouth before it could be digested until the weight came off. She had nice boobs, small, pert, high on her chest. Narrow hips with a high gymnast butt, muscular from hours of pommel and floor work. Her butt was her best asset, not her face. It was petite and smooth and every boy wanted to fuck her the minute he saw her from behind.

**A telling detail:**

Her butt was her best asset, not her face. It was petite and smooth and every boy wanted to fuck her the minute he saw her from behind.

**Birthplace order in family:**

Lydia was yanked out of her mother's body by an African hotel doctor in Lamu when her mother was on staying at a European hotel where all the Europeans went naked and the Muslim women wore Burkas. She was an only child. Pregnancy was not a mistake her mother made again. Her father was a child support check from a trust fund managed by a bank in California.

**Relationship with mother:**

Lydia's relationship with her mother was like two ships passing the night.

Lydia's relationship with her mother was like the relationship her mother had with her Luis Vuitton luggage. She valued it for what it said about her more than for what it could carry. She made sure the maid put it up on a shelf and cleaned it. If it went missing, say it was stolen, or someone walked off with it at the airport baggage counter, it wasn't a tragedy if it got lost.

**Educational history and ambition:**

Lydia's school was haphazard at best. She studied in Lausanne, Switzerland, at a girl's school for a couple of years, went to private school for three years in Grosse Point when she lived with Grandpa Ben and Adele, then during a brief fling Rahel had with a Superintendent of Public Schools, she went to NY public school in Manhattan for less than a semester. Rahel took her out of PS #19 in a NY minute the day Lydia came home with head lice. Most of high school was spent back in Switzerland at a different girl's school, where they taught her to etiquette and how to dress in deportment classes and she taught herself how to undress under the lacrosse bleachers with the assistant coach.

**Sexuality and sexual history:**

After sex with Aldo the night before he and her mother got married, she went into a kind of sexual deep freeze for two years until her boobs caught up with rest of her body. Then it was like the water tap got stuck on overflow when she met the lacrosse coach and he taught her how to enjoy herself.

**Important objects:**

Lydia started collecting purses at a young age and before she turned 16, she had a collection that rivaled a department store. She brought "only a dozen" to Inner Horizons where she had nothing to put in the bags but they still looked like she was worth a million dollars.

Lydia amassed a collection of purses that rivaled Harrod's department store. She always looked put together---a purse to match every outfit she wore ---yet she never carried anything in the bags. The Program had taken away her iPhone, cash and credit cards, her driver's license, her Coach coin purse and wallet. The only thing they left her was her NICC student ID. The only place you could go with that was the library and Lydia wasn't interested in reading.

**Core needs:**

Lydia is empty and she feels like a bottomless pit. She wants always to be filled up. She wants to prove she exists and won't be forgotten about. If she isn't trying to connect for sex, she is filling herself up with compulsive eating, then vomiting it all up.

**What does the character do when they're alone:**

Lydia hates to be alone. She'll do anything to avoid it, even talk to Margaret so she doesn't have to look closely at herself and see how small and insignificant she is.

120418 Darlene didn't get it

Darlene didn't get it. She frowned at Estie, fingering the clipboard as if she was contemplating erasing the three she'd just written down.

"The point of the exercise is to bring something of your own that you care about. Why are you bringing something that belongs to Lydia?"

"She let me," Estie said simply. The simple truth from the village idiot. It wasn't a result of all Lydia's years of therapy that told her Estie had magpie syndrome. Anyone with eyes could see that the crash-damaged girl adored anything shiny or glitzy. There was no point looking for some long, psychologically deep explanation because Estie didn't know herself. She just wanted it. Simple as that.

"What difference does it make?" Lydia spoke despite her every inclination. "She likes it. I let her."

"This isn't some fantasy exercise," Darlene said. "I'm trying to teach you all something."

Estie was clutching the sparkling bag to her capacious belly. She was hunched over, as if she was expecting a blow, but holding the bag against her as if it could save her.

"If the bag means so much to her, why don't you give it to her." Dani. Ever wise to any chance to make trouble.

"And by the way, Dani, you're getting a one for not participating in the exercise." Darlene played that bomb without anyone expecting it. "Unless you plan to go back to your bedroom to pick something to share."\
Dani refused. She got a one. And Estie was somehow forgotten while Dani cursed and Darlene sent her off to her room for a time out, as if she was a toddler instead of 22 with Double D bra cups that made her an highly sought after as a pole dancer.

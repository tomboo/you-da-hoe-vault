Esty Responds to Bullying: Old Girl POV

Cynthia Hartwig

Late afternoon. What Old Girl's mom used to call Cyanide Hour.

Esty had just gotten back from Stable in a haze of Seroquel or Ziprexa or whatever anti-psychotic they gave her at the medical gulag they called Stabilization to calm her the fuck down.

Nobody would say officially what was wrong with her. The fat girl was always prone to wall-staring and carpet watching but lately, she'd go off on a fit of violence you couldn't predict was coming. Maybe brain damage? Dropped on her head as a baby? Somebody had told Old Girl she came into the Program straight from the hospital after some kind of car crash. A big scar zippered her dull face through one eyebrow and she lumbered with an odd, halting shuffle like her knee or a hip was messed up.

This was where Old Girl agreed with the rules at Inner Journeys: if somebody "shared" what was wrong with them, it was OK, but God forbid you should ever ask for somebody's story. "Don't ask, never tell" was Old Girl's preferred code. Esty? Who knew what she thought because she never spoke.

All the kids hated Esty because she had no sense of personal boundaries and she didn't like to bathe. Once, Old Girl was with her in downtown Couer D'Alene for a dentist appointment and Esty dropped her drawers and peed like a cow pissing on a flat rock in an open alley. Every passing car honked when they saw her big white moony ass.

Generally, she smelled musty and unwashed. Today, Princess Leia claimed she hadn't changed her underwear in a week. "Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Go sit over there," she'd ordered Esty when she'd lumped down next to Leia in the circle of couches. Then Reza, on the next couch over, held up two fingers in a vampire cross. "Don't you dare stink next to me!" He threw his feet up on the unoccupied half of that flowered couch so she had no place to go unless she sat on the couch arm.

Finally, Esty just flopped onto the floor next to Old Girl's feet, using the flat part next to her dangling legs as a backrest. Esty bumped her ankle and Old Girl moved away with a jerk of irritation. If everybody wasn't already picking on her, Old Girl would have slapped her.

The thought surprised her. Usually Old Girl stayed out of the petty dramas and ongoing meanness at the Program. She was strong enough to fend off any bullshit aimed at her own person. But today, all the torment visited on Esty after she got back from Stable seemed well deserved.

For the past hour, the stupid cow had been sitting on the plaid couch like a lump of blubber and just taking Reza and Leia and Paul's jabs like a beaten creature. Did they torture her just to see if they could get a rise out of her? Or was it some kind of need to get a reaction to prove they were the strong ones and Esty was the weak?

"Jesus, you've got a lard ass." Leia said from her perch on the only wingback chair in the living area. "Don't you ever look at yourself in the mirror?"

Leia had her room all to herself for two weeks while Esty was at Stable being drugged to the teeth on whatever antipsychotics they were giving her for her violent outbursts. You'd think Leia would have been thankful. Unless the little bitch was trying to engineer another blow up?

"Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?" Reza, the supposedly ex-meth addict, who was small and dark as a Rhesus monkey, sized jup his audience. "A smart ass!" he crowed.

Old Girl muttered "dumb ass" to Rachel, who was next to her writing a letter home. Picking on Esty was like punching a bowl of Jello. Fat, blobby Esty just absorbed the blows with a small quiver. She didn't fight back. Wasn't quick enough to make snappy comebacks or defend herself. An hour before when she'd come back from medical lockdown, she'd been miles away, so far deep within herself, she barely registered anything they dished out.

Now though, a few ominous details told Old Girl that Esty might be waking up. Her red-rimmed eyes had lost their vague haziness. Her foot was jumping. The pokes were still landing in Jello but they were starting to annoy her.

Close to dinner, Esty lumbered off to the bathroom and while she was gone, Reza and Paul got to arm wrestling on the floor. One of them kicked over a glass of water on the end table next to the middle couch. They ignored the spill, just let it soak into the cushions, not that Old Girl thought the old couch would be worse for wear.

When Esty came back, she immediately sat on the wet spot and everybody whooped with laughter. Her face was blank. No idea why everyone was hooting.

Jesus. Was Esty so slow she didn't feel her butt getting wet? Apparently.

Reza, with a feral gleam in his weaselly eyes, said, "You just went to the batroom. How come you peed in your pants?"

Esty wrinkled a bovine forehead. "I didn't pee my pants."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

That made people howl like hyenas. You could almost hear the gears in Esty's drugged brain clanking toward the feeling of dampness on her pants. She stood up and turned her broad, cottage-cheesed ass to the group and tried to peer at herself over her shoulder as her hand groped around on the dark spreading stain.

What were the odds that two 18-year-old bed wetters would surface in the same treatment program? The real reason Esty ended up in Stable was because her roommate Leia had tattled on her for wetting the bed and then, when Esty's therapist asked her where she'd hidden the sheets, she punched his lights out. Just last week, Old Girl overheard Margaret telling Darlene that they needed to buy Reza a rubber sheet because he kept soaking the mattress.

If Old Girl had been wetting her bed, she would have kept her mouth shut about anybody who couldn't control their bladder but Reza did just the opposite. Apparently, if you hated yourself for being weak, the second you got a chance to hurt someone even weaker, you piled on with both feet and your kidneys. Was it because hurting someone else felt so much better than being hurt?

The whole group, by now, was jeering. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Stinker!" "You pissed yourself!" Nobody came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit, Old Girl told herself for maybe the thousandth time.

Esty's befuddlement, if it hadn't been so damn irritating, was horrible. She knew she hadn't pissed herself but she couldn't figure out how she got wet. She threw Old Girl, a sometime ally, a look of silent pleading that Old Girl ignored. She wanted to stab her for being so stupid. Such a fucking victim. "No wonder Esty stinks," Old Girl called out loud. "She's piss poor at holding her water!"

When Darlene finally called them into dinner ("Meat loaf, yay!) it took Old Girl a few minutes to figure out what the next little game was.

Paul picked the seat across from Esty and Leia plopped down beside her while Reza took the chair on her other side. When the meatloaf dish was passed to Leia, she took a slice, then slid it across the table to Paul, who sent the dish down the opposite side of the table away from Esty. Reza speared a boiled potato and sent the serving dish the opposite direction. He repeated the action when the butter came to him, then the peas. The only food that was allowed near Esty was the undressed spinach salad (therapists doled out dressing0 garnished with two paltry egg slices and a lone mushroom.

"Hey, Leia, " Esty was eyeing the nearly empty meatloaf platter. "The meat loaf skipped me."

Leia made wide, blue eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Of course she did," Reza said smoothly. "Right after I passed you the potatoes."

The only thing on Esty's plate was the lone dinner roll the Program allowed people on the "high energy protein" diet. Skinny Paul, on the high fat diet, was busy shoveling glops of butter onto a mound of potatoes the size of Mt. Spudmore. "What?" Paul said, looking up. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't."

Darlene, sensing something brewing, interrupted her rant about black ice and called down from the head of the table, "Esty, how come you're not eating anything?"

Reza turned to Esty and flopped a gush of naked, wilting spinach on top of Esty's dinner roll. "Have some greens, Es. They make your shit smell sweet."

For a second, Old Girl thought Esty might howl with frustration. She was frowning at the spinach like it was garbage and when she picked up her fork, Old Girl expected her to use it to flick the crap to the floor. Instead, Esty gripped the handle in her fist and drove the tines into the back of Reza's hand.

Reza screamed. He tried to bolt up from the table, but was stopped midway by Esty who threw her considerable bulk over his forearm and drove the fork deeper into the tabletop with her fist.

"Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated a babble of voices\--"Bitch!" "Esty, let go!" Stop! Stop!"---while Leia's high pitched laugh went on and on.

Esty reached across the table with her free hand and dragged a slice of meatloaf from Paul's plate. She chewed thoughtfully while Darlene and Reza tried to dislodge her grip which had successful pinned Reza's hand to the table between thumb and forefinger.

Old Girl, at the bottom of the table, watched the herking-jerking scene at the table like a movie reel. She chewed and then carefully swallowed a bland boiled potato. The butter dish, now upended between Reza's flopping feet on the shag carpet, would be fuzzed with orange. Dessert was definitely off the table, she thought. If Margaret had been on duty, she'd make sure they got popcorn later, but Darlene---fucking clueless Darlene---would have no idea how to feed the hungry.

091415 MidPoint Bullying Esty Draft

Classes had been cancelled so they were all been stuck in the living room all day. Three feet of snow dumped over twenty-four hours and even in Idaho, where there was one snowplow for every other car, there was no way to keep the roads clear.

By noon, the living room of Healing House looked like it had been taken over by a ragtag bunch of those Wall Street occupiers. The ones who had more rage than ideas and didn't give a shit how much mess they made for somebody else to clean up.

Everybody who lived at Healing House had spread out, colonizing as much space as possible. Blankets, laundry baskets, peechee folders, text books, every game from the Game Room from Parcheesi to checkers to Twister and Monopoly and cribbage and Risk. Tiny tokens littered the rug and people were constantly cursing when they stepped on them. They'd played a game for a few minutes, then abandon it for some other one that was supposedly more fun until everybody was in total agreement. They all sucked.

Outside, snow continued to fall l in leaden, never ending streams that showed no signs of stopping. The van couldn't get out of the driveway. In the morning, Margaret had tried to drive onto the main road over the snow berm left by an early morning snow plow and now the old beast was high centered on a two foot dike of ice. When the people who thought they were going to class at NICC trudged back inside, white shrouded them before they got through the door.

At first, people were thrilled to have a snow day. No school---yippee!\-- after a couple hours of close contact dealing with every mental disorder in the DSM became reality, the mood had darkened.

By 4 PM it was just plain mean.

Lunch was some inedible stew thing with floating chunks of unidentifiable meat. Old Girl swore an ear had landed in her bowl and once the idea got lodged in her mind, she had to excuse herself from the table to bolt for the restroom.

Maybe she was getting the flu. Was that why a yawning hole had opened up in her belly?

Darlene had put a stop to all the games because there was too much fighting.

The living room was a big room though it felt cramped and claustrophobic with a dozen people doing that thing Old Girl had seen on the Nature channel: everybody was making themselves big and taking up space in order to make their enemies feel smaller. It worked with gorillas. Why not psychiatric patients?

Princess Danny and Reza, for example, laid claim to the entire plaid couch. Weaselly Reza was squashed in the corner, while Danny lay in state like Queen of the Underworld. True, Danny stood about 6' tall. Before she'd been locked up in the nut house, she played volleyball forward at Ohio State.

Dinner suckitude included gray peas and gray meat loaf and gray-greasy gravy that was a dead ringer for motor oil. And now with Reza getting stabbed, dessert was officially off the table. Jesus. Weren't these people legally obligated to feed you something you could actually swallow?

Accompanied by the sounds of Reza's sniffles like distant music, Old Girl stacked up a bunch of dinner plates and hip-bumped her way into the kitchen with her arms full. She intended to dump the dishes on the counter --it wasn't her day for clean-up---and she was startled to see that Danny had gotten to the kitchen counter ahead of her. She was at the counter, bent over a lemon meringue pie and lapping at it like a dog. "What the hell?"

Danny's head came up. A yellow gout of neon yellow clung to her cheek. "It's mine," she said. "For graduating early."

"You? You didn't graduate, you manipulated your way out of here."

"So?"

"So save some dessert for the rest of us."

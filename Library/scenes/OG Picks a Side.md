> Friday morning, OG heard Margaret tell Darlene she was at the end of her rope with Gretchen.
>
> In Illinois, where OG grew up, you could be at your my wit's end with someone or up to your ass in alligators, but the Idaho version with a rope was new to her. She learned its utility on Martin Luther King Day.
>
> The January sky opened up Sunday night of holiday weekend and dumped a record 24 inches of snow. At four AM, State authorities shut down I-90. By 6 AM, County authorities were allowing only "emergency" travel and they stopped plowing anything but major arterials. The Coeur D'Alene postal service, for the first time in decades, called off mail delivery. Even the Coeuer d'Alene mall closed, which was bigger news than the Post Office closure.
>
> Inside Healing House, the weather was worse.
>
> Charlene's bald tires sailed her Pinto into a ditch and Margaret couldn't get out of her driveway until her neighbor came to plow her out. Gretchen and Darlene, the only people with four-wheel drive, herded everybody at Healing House into the living room. Gretchen said they were shifting from man-to-man defense to zone defense: ergo, nobody was allowed to hang out in their rooms. It was mass incarceration in the living room.
>
> The day started out with Gretchen burning the oatmeal black on the bottom. Everybody who refused to eat it --- all eight people at the table, including OG--- got oned out in the quadrant of "living by the rules" which apparently didn't include Gretchen for not being able to follow a recipe.
>
> Right away, Reza got mad at James for calling him Apu; James called Reza a crybaby and then Rachel got mad at James for being mean and insensitive; Dani got mad at Inger for siding with Lydia over which Kardashian was hotter; Inger was already pissed at Lydia and then went nuclear because Lydia smoked her last cigarette; Darlene pre-emptively separated them to to opposite corners but Dani and Reza called the plaid couch and James and Rachel got there first and with possession being nine-tenths of the law at Healing House, the flowered couch became the site of Couch-pocolypse until Dani, Reza, James and Inger got second round of ones for "failure to respect community values." Gretchen asked for Darlene's help in the kitchen and Darlene told her she wasn't paid enough to chop vegetables so Gretchen accused her of being up on her high horse because Darlene had a Ph.d and Gretchen only had a Masters.
>
> After that OG lost track of who was mad at whom. It didn't really matter because it was one big mad no matter where she looked.
>
> After snack (two apple slices and what Reza called a "monkey's nut" of cheese) a fight broke out over the Parcheesi board (Paul v. Reza); James moved his seat and started a snit over who got to sit next to him (Rachel v. Lydia); a question of what unidentifiable meat was cooking in the stew turned rancorous (Dani guessed rattle snake while Big Paul's won the popular vote with Dr. Hazey's nose). Soon after, Big Paul discovered that some asshole stole the Queen from the chess set and he checkmated the game forever by breaking the board over his knee and thunking it in the fireplace.
>
> OG sat on the floor, her back propped against the plaid couch, and kept her head down most of the day. She had a stupid English paper on stupid Animal Farm due by the next day.
>
> The stupid assignment was to come up with an allegory from the current day that matched Orwell's use of the Russia Revolution that Animal Farm was based on. Professor Lengel had given them the assignment two weeks ago. OG's plan was to go to the library to look up the situation in Myanmar with the the repressive military who were persecuting the Rohinga tribe who'd fled from Bangladesh. Because of the snow dump, she had no access to NICC, much less the library which was buried in three feet of snow. How the hell was she going to write about whatever was happening in the real world when she was locked 20 miles beyond it?
>
> How could she could write an allegory when the only thing to allegorize were the people surrounding her who all made her sick? The second the idea struck her, Margaret transformed into Horse. Margaret was always smiling with her big long teeth. The woman's big ass laugh sounded like cross between a neigh and a bray.
>
> Dr. Hazey was just as easy -- he was the Tsar, the old, clueless representative of the old, clueless regime: rich, isolated, out of touch with his workers.
>
> It was no leap to make Grinchen into Squealer the Pig, the master user of the propaganda machine who convinced the farm animals that black was white. "We don't want to drink the milk and eat the apples. We only eat them because we have to." Gretchen said essentially the same thing tabout the bulk, aging spinach she always served from Costco as well as the gristle pretending to be beef. A-one. Nothing but the best. So full of nutritional fiber that an ungulate stomach was needed for digestion.
>
> No wonder her favorite Animal Farm character was Donkey. Dour. Depressing. Doomed. She could relate to his incessant heehawing about life being bad and always getting worse. He wouldn't pick a side on the windmill or any other farm project. Why bother when both sides on any argument were wrong.
>
> By early afternoon, she'd written eight pages of a make-shift allegory her professor was unlikely to accept.
>
> Around two-thirty, when Josh came stomping in to the living room around three, shedding snow like a yeti, she was relieved. Any diversion was better than the sight of the snow continuing to fall like a never-ending curtain.
>
> Josh conscripted Darlene and Gretchen into helping him half-drag and half-carry Estie into Healing House. Estie had been locked up at Stablization for a week. She was in that semi-catatonic state Stable liked to keep you in, looped to the eyeballs, eyes at half-mast , when they shuffled her into the living room. OG recognized the haze of Thorazine or whatever anti-psychotic the nurses injected in you to calm you down. Last week, Estie had punched Axel in the throat for refusing to give her a candy bar a day or two before Lydia got Axel fired. Lucky Axel.
>
> Josh tried to get Dani to give up the plaid couch but she had a shit fit. She'd called it first thing after breakfast. That was the problem with getting oned out too early in the day. There was no zero at Inner Horizons so what else were they going to do to you except take away dessert? Big whoop: there usually wasn't any. Well, ecxcept for tonight. Dani's parents were taking her out of the program tomorrow for lack of progress so Margaret had made lemon meringue pie to celebrate.
>
> Estie snored with her back, mouth open like a volcano for almost two hours. OG didn't know what was wrong with her unless it was brain damage. Lately, she'd been having unpredictable fits of violence. She had come into the Program a few months after a car crash that killed the driver. A big scar zippered her face through one eyebrow. Her knee and her hip was messed up, so she lumbered with an listing gait.
>
> OG usually ignored her---why bother with someone who couldn't help it?--- but everybody else at the Program hated her.
>
> Estie didn't like to bathe. She had no sense of personal boundaries or social awareness.
>
> Once, when Estie and OG went to a dentist appointment in downtown Coeuer D'Alene, Estie dropped her pants in the parking lot and peed like a cow pissing on a flat rock. A passing car honked at the sight of the white moon of her giant ass.
>
> Today, Princess Lydia started in on her the moment they propped her up on the floor next to OG.
>
> "Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Go sit over there!" Lydia cried.

Reza blocked the end of the plaid couch he was sharing with Dani with his feet. "You haven't changed your underwear in a week. Don't you dare stink next to me!"

In her zombified state, Esty looked so lumpy and sad-sack, Old Girl couldn't bear to look at her. What if general blobbiness and abject misery was catching? It was bad enough to be OG's doomed self without taking on Estie's misery. They'd given Thorazine to OG the first time she went to Stable and she'd come out as dry as a desert in the worst confusion of her life. Estie, now listing to one side against the couch, like a foundering ship, snored and whoofled in her sleep. OG hoped she'd keep sleeping forever because when she woke up, she'd regret it.

OG had no idea who Estie was in the Animal Farm allegory. She wasn't any of the speaking parts and as far as OG remembered, there weren't any non-speaking ones, unless she counted the owners of the farm who were MIA.

Around dinner time, Estie began to twitch and groan, like a waking bear. Dani, noting signs of life, started the poke fest. *"*Hey lard ass, you're farting,*"* she said*. "*Point that big ass somewhere else before you splat me."

Reza said, "Pigs snort quieter than you."

Estie opened her eyes blearily, but gave no sign that she heard their insults. Perhaps a slight quiver in her belly. Inger muttered, "Jesus, she smells like R. Kelly\'s sheets." A muscle in her jaw clenched. She was awake but it was like their jabs landed in a bowl of jelly that just quivered and shook.

When Big Paul called her a barge. Lydia said, no, she was a bigger than that, she was a tanker.

Reza pounced and henceforward, her name became Stanker.

"Hey Stanker, close your mouth," he called.

Dani said, " Stanker, stop snorting like a while."

Reza asked, "Stanker, where's your wanker?" The kind of intelligence that passed for wit at Healing House.

After the long, horrible day, Old Girl felt like slapping Estie herself. Christ, why couldn't yourself? Estie was twice as big as Reza. She could have hoisted Dani, a stripper who was lead and willowy, on one shoulder and heaved her out a window without breaking a sweat.

"Don't call me Stanker," Estie said, a small muscle in her jaw ticking like a clock. Esty's eyes weren't quite as dull. She seemed to be losing her vague, harmless affect..

"If you take a shower tonight, you can go back to being Tanker," Lydia said.

Why Lydia kept picking at Estie was a mystery to OG. Lydia had her room all to herself while Estie was at Stable. You'd think she would have been thankful. Or was Lydia trying to engineer another week by herself?

"Jesus, you've got a lard ass. Don't you ever look at yourself in the mirror?" Lydia asked the room.

Reza said, "Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?"

Estie opened an eye and said, "Dunno."

"A smart ass," Reza crowed.

All the torture Reza and Lydia and Paul visited on the big lardy girl today seemed deserved. Estie makes me sick, OG thought, surprising herself. Stupid Esty wouldn't fight back. She just sat like a lump of blubber and took their jabs and kicks like a dog. Couldn't they give it a rest? "Dumb ass" came out under OG's breath.

Quick as a dagger, Reza said, "See, even OG agrees. She just called you a dumb ass!"

Estie flashed a hurt and surprised look at OG. Usually OG was civil to her. Sometimes she was even nice but today, she didn't have the bandwidth for being nice to anyone but herself.

Estie heaved herself up and lumbered off in the direction of the bathroom without looking at OG.

In her absence, Reza and Paul started another foot wrestling game. The idea was to see who could flip the other over without using their hands. Paul knocked against the side table and upset a glass of water Reza had been drinking. It spilled right where Reza had been sitting.

Estie lumbered back, and promptly plopped down on the wet spot.\
"You just went to the can," Reza said, his face looking innocent as a choir boy. "How come you pissed your pants?"\
\"Didn't.\" said Estie.\
"Then why's your ass wet?" Reza said. "Can't you feel it?"\
Estie stood. She twisted her torso around so that she was peering at one cottage cheese textured ass cheek. She groped her butt and patted at it blindly, groping a large dark spot that ran from her hip to mid-thigh. Then she held up one damp hand at frowned at it. "Why's it wet?"

Dani sing-songed: "Pee Wee has a wee-wee."

"Or a pee-pee," answered Reza.

Lydia started to laugh. James and Inger joined in. Even OG couldn't stop herself from chuckling. The look Estie threw around her was mutely flummoxed.

Gretchen interrupted twith the heartless cry, "Dinner is served, lucky people!"

It took OG a while to figure out the game at dinner.

She took a seat half-way down the table from Estie with a clear view of both ends. Dani and Reza took up positions on both sides of Estie Lydia plonked down on the other side of the table, opposite Estie, effectively boxing her in. Gretchen came in from the kitchen, bearing with the meatloaf platter and set it down next to Dani. Dani took a slice, then passed the platter down the table away from Estie. Lydia, on the other side of the table, passed the boiled potatoes on to Big Paul further down the table, and Reza passed the boiled peas next to him in Inger's direction. Nothing was passed to Estie. The butter plate sat next to her but there was nothing on Estie's plate to put it on.

"Hey," Esty looked down at the far end table at the dwindling supply of meatloaf as it made its journey around. "You skipped me."

Lydia made wide, shocked eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Yes you did," Reza said. "Right before I passed you the potatoes."

"I didn't get the potatoes."

Darlene, who was rabbiting on to Cindy, a new girl, about the blizzard that was forecast later in the week, paid no attention. No help there.

James asked Estie to pass the butter and proceeded to shoveled half a stick on a mound of potatoes he'd piled up like Mount Spudmore.

"What?" James looked around at Lydia and Dani who were watching him. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't,"" Estie said.

Darlene interrupted a discussion about black ice, calling down the table, "Is there a problem?"

Reza promptly flopped a plateful of naked, wilted spinach on top of Estie's plate. "Here's your favorite, Stanker. Greens'll make your shit smell sweet."

James motioned to Reza. "Pass the salad, Monkey Boy." Estie looked at the meat loaf platter, now empty, in the middle of the table. Please, please, please, pass me something, her moist eyes said. In her eyes there was a kind of dumb animal inertness , like the expression of an old dog who'd been beaten for begging.

The cliques that claqued around the room all day, the tight space, the relentless endless snow, the sniping, the bickering, the sophomoric jokes, the People magazines, the Parcheesi pieces underfoot, and Estie's bovine paralysis, even her the pig snuffling sound of her breath, all yanked on the rope that OG had been spooling out during treatment to its end.

She found herself up and moving before she'd even decided to intercede. She grabbed the meatloaf platter halted in the middle of the table next to Inger and shoved her way between Reza and Estie . Over Reza's high-pitched "hey!" OG dragged the platter into Estie's reach and shouted, "Feed yourself, goddamn it. No one's going to do it for you!"

Reza rocked and twisted trying to grab the platter away but OG planted both feet and blocked his reaching arm by holding onto it while using the other arm to hold the platter still. Now that she wasn't trying to tighten end of the rope around her neck and stuff it down her throat, she had the indignation of an avenging angel and commensurate weight.

Estie plucked the big serving fork from the platter and drove the sharpened tines into Reza's hand.

"Eeeeeee!!!" Reza's scream of terror cut through dinner conversation like cleaver.

Estie threw her own considerable weight over Reza like a trained commando, bumping OG out of the way. Cutlery flew like missiles. Platters shattered. Dani and James on their way to help or hinder the fight, smacked heads. Darlene and Gretchen ran toward the roiling, rolling couple from opposite directions screaming "Stop!" An insane bubbling series of "yee-hee-hees" from Dani rang in constant counterpoint to Reza's highpitched howls. When James got to Reza and tried to wrestle Estie off his arm, Reza squealed. "Don't! I'm nailed to the fucking wood!"

OG backed slowly from the fracas, finally exiting the dining room by backing through the swinging door of the kitchen. She took drink at the sink where she stood panting while she waited for her heart rate to come down.

The snow had stopped. The sky outside had cleared to a dark, matte black with no stars. Purple shadows under the snow-covered trees turned to gold where the kitchen lights touched the drifts. The darkness beyond the kitchen was so still, compared to the cacophony in the next room, she longed to let the quiet envelop her. It felt like she'd run a marathon when all she had done was hold the meatloaf for Estie.

She remembered the surprisingly delicate pop of Reza's ulna as it shifted under his radius when she held his arm down. The bright moistness of Estie's eyes which were crackling with excitement as she drove the fork into Reza's flesh.

OG had taken a leap from the cliff of non-involvement. She'd picked a side. No going back now.

Estie had looked like she was about to cry, when in fact, she'd been thrilled to the bone to drive the fork into the fat well of flesh between Reza's thumb and forefinger.

In Estie's bright eyes, she had seen the desire and violence that mirrored her own. It was OG's strength that had given Estie the power to act for herself. The rope she'd been using so long to rein herself in -- she had come to the end of it and let fly. She --- OG, Angela, \_\_\_\_\_--- had acted for someone else and she could hardly credit how good it felt.

In the midst of this singular revelation, OG dimly heard the door to the kitchen open behind her. Reza's howls were ratcheting down to low whimpers. Her own breathing was easier. Not so loud in her ears. Then she heard the click-click-click of silverware against metal.

Dani stood behind her hunched over the side counter. She was forking the lemon meringue pie that Margaret had set out to cool for Dani's celebration into her mouth. Pie was disappearing down her open gullet as if she wasn't chewing at all.

To OG's astonishment, the pie which OG had dimly registered when she walked in, was already half gone. Blobby egg whites and fractured gouts of crust remained.

"What ithehell?" OG said. "Margaret made that pie for everybody!"

" 's my pie."

Dani's voice, full of food, was hard to understand. She kept shoveling in bites as the words flew out, so crumbs of crust and blobs of meringue flew out as fast as pie filling went in. OG heard a garbled "graduation" followed by what she thought might be "celebration." The only word that was distinct was "...mine."

"That's not yours! Margaret made the pie for everybody!"

"I'm graduating and getting the fuck out of here." She kept chewing and motioned beyond the kitchen to the dining room where Darlene could be heard saying "THe's nailed to the table. Take the whole leaf."

"You didn't graduate. Your parents are taking you out because you're not progressing.""

"Better than being stuck forever in this zoo."

In a moment in which time which seemed to elongate and stretch, OG saw that the rope she thought she was done with had one more kink in it.

Dani had already turned back to the pie. Her torso was bent, neck curved and vulnerable. She brought the pan up to her mouth over the counter so she could keep eating without getting pie crap on her blouse.

OG reached out and shoved the back of her head down with all her might. As with Reza, her extra height and heightened moral conviction gave her extra strength. Dani's head hit the bottom of the pie pan with a satisfying clonk. A strangled cry of rage broke through the curd but OG was too busy giving Dani's face a hard grinding shake to listen. "Eat your fill," OG said. "Reza was for Estie. This one's for me."

It was amazing how satisfying it felt to rat Dani out for the whole darn pie, though she had to wait until they carted Reza off to the van to take him to Emergency.

Gretchen was adamant that they kept the fork " in situ" which sounded more intelligent than "let the medical people figure out what to do." OG watched the entire production of getting both the leaf and Reza, now crying bitterly, out the front door.

James thought leaving the fork in it was stupid. "He can't bleed to death. It's a fork, not a twelve-inch blade! Plus, tell me how many vital organs there are in the hand?"

"It could have been worse" was Big Paul's comment. "His hand could have been around his dick."

A lot worse, thought OG.

When she ratted Dani out to Squealer nee' Gretchen, all she could think of was, Fuck you, Donkey. I'm done with that.\<\$n\>

041417 OG reaction to epileptic fit

James reaction to replace Rachel\'s POV

rewrite at Two Mouth Lake to moose

Old Girl\'s reaction to the moose seemed outsized and overblown. So much for her jones for killing herself if she was too chicken to watch a creature die.

James snorted. As if a stupid stick was going to support a thousand pound moose with antlers the size of a barbell. What was the moose supposed to do with the alder branch? Bite it? James didn\'t know shit about moose but at least he knew that a herbivore didn\'t have the teeth to hold on.

There was the usual pushing and shoving to claim the Rorschach blot couch. Nobody wanted to sit on the plaid couch\--commonly known as the Jizz Couch\--since Lydia had been caught banging Alex, her therapist, on it. Dani, hip-checked tiny Lydia out of the way earning an outraged hiss. Darlene threw them both the eye but Dani crowed anyway, \"Mine, suckers, mine!\"

Lydia stretched out full length by herself and sniffed loudly. Who cared about sitting on the jizz couch, especially when it was her own?

Process Group was its usual caldron of petty resentments and un-up-mans-ship and oversharing marked by an occasional \"Language!\" warning from Darlene which everyone routinely ignored.

OG feels electricity running through the new girl

Could James feel the new girl\'s bolt of electricity like she could? It felt like she was being electrocuted by proxy and it scared her, this feeling of polar opposites connected. Her white hands gripped Rachels slim black upper arms with an iron grip. Underneath her fingrs she couldfeel bones as delicate as green tree limbs but pulsing with alien life.

The jolting and sparking was deeply unnerving. It made Old Girl want to run at the same time that her hands were stapled to Rachel\'s body in the act of being kidnapped by runaway life.

Jesus, she was thinking. Get me out of here!

From the stricken look in James blue eyes opposite her as he held on for dear life to her shins, she understood that he was feeling the same awe and horror and shame. James could no more disconnect tthan she could.

Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck. This girl needs us to hold her to this earth and I can barely hold myself here with everything I\'ve got.

Up to that moment, running had always been in Old Girl\'s mind as an fuzzy possibility. She was exactly like every other resident at Inner Horizons. She hated and loathed the Program and woke up every morning believing she couldn\'t stand it one more day, then woke the next morning and saw that she was still here. The constant psychobabble about self- actualization and self-denial and self-development and self-knowledge and self education and self-disgust made her acutely aware that the only way to save her sorry self was to run.

No more shilly-shallying. Run tonight.

Shilly-shallying\--where had that come from? Shilly-shallying was something her mother would have said if she wasn\'t now a greasy spot on the railroad tracks with Dad and baby Gabe after being shoved into a train by a geriatric driver who mistook his gas pedal for a brake. No shilly-shallying there.

The senior citizen had been going 45 miles per hour when he crashed into them from the rear and the train was going 50 when it hit them on the tracks and there was basically nothing left but gristle and bone when it came time to bury them. This from matter-of-fact Aunt Peggy who conveyed this nugget of information to her best friend when she thought Old Girl was out coldon the couch with a sedative the day after it happened.

She brought her attention back to Rachel\'s surprisingly firm biceps. Her eggplant colored hands thumped against the floor while her heels beat their own crazy tattoo even though James had a white-knuckled grip on her shins.

Shilly-shallying is over. Go.

OG\'s bedroom conversation with Rachel about being raised by white people

\"YouDaHo if you fuck around with James. The program frowns on fishing off the Inner Horizons dock.

\"What do they care?\" Rachel asked.

\"Pregnancy? STDs? Chlamydia? If somebody has crabs, then everybody gets them.\"

\"Ewww. Grosss.\" Rachel wrinkled her nose in disgust. \"You\'re kidding, right?\"

Old Girl ostentatiously scratched her crotch and said, \"Not really.\"

Old Girl felt perpetually like a fish out of water. Ever since her family was erased on a sunny day in springtime, flowers budding out, the air smelled lemony with promise, she felt dewply suspicious of everything from gravity to the weather. It that could happen, why not a tsunami or a lightning strike in the middle of an open field?

Old Girl always felt like an alien. Sure, the rest of the people in treatment had problems like drug abuse or chemical imbalances or brain injuries or just plain old immaturity and a chip on their shoulders about growing up. But they still had intact families. People loved them, no matter how fucked up they were. What did Old Girl have? A beleaguered and stressed aunt and uncle who were doing their best for her to the detriment of their own kids and precarious finances. Aunt Peggy and Uncle David tried so hard to make her feel like a part of the family but she was along and she knew it.

Rachel\'s voice was sniffly and snot-occluded. \"Mom and Dad try so hard to understand me but I swear, it\'s like eating glass.\"

She told how her dad took her to hip-hop classes until she finally got up the courage to tell him she hated rap. Her mother signed up up in middle school to volunteer for the NAACP when all Rachel wanted to do was take more ballet classes. \"They\'re white,\" she said. \"It\'s not a free pass to cluelessness.\"

The story that seemed to irk her the most was that her mother organized play dates with the house cleaner\'s children and all they wanted to do was play with her white Barbie dolls. \"What\'s wrong wit\' you?\" the little girl asked her. \"How come Barbie ain\'t white?\"

She ended the story of her woes with the admission that her mom wanted to name her Rosa Parks Cathcart.

Old Girl wasn\'t sure what the appropriate response to that was. She made a neutral noise in the back of her throat.

\"Dad wanted Harriett Tubman.\"

\"So how did they arrive at Rachel?\"

\"My name isn\'t Rachel. It\'s Rosa Harriett Tubman Cathcart.\"

\"I don\'t get it.\"

\"Rachel is my grandmother\'s name. She asked them to call me Rachel when she was dying and they said OK.\"

Okayyyy. Families were definitely weird. \"Do you like Stranger in a Strange Land?\"

It was sliding down the slippery silk patch on the crazy quilt.

\"It\'s OK. Story of my life, and all that.\"

\"Mmmmm.\" Old Girl was thinking of saying that Rachel could be a Stranger in a Familiar Land but instead, she said, \"It\'s better than Tubman.\"

Rachel laughed. A clear infectious tone. \"Small mercies, right?\"

\"Right. Time to shut it down.\" She switched off her headlamp to signal that sharing time was over.

Too bad she was leaving tonight, she was thinking. Tubman had a sense of humor. Just when you found someone who would laugh at your suicide jokes, you ran out of time to tell them.

Girl, you better get ready for heads to whip around when you walk down the street in Couer D\'Alene. The headquarters of the Aryan Nations is 15 miles away at Hayden Lake and the only black people they want to see are on the TV show, *Cops*.

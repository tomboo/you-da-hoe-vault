030619 Reza and the corner of the room from James pov

They were both slobs, but of the two of them, James was the worst. Reza's mess seemed contained in a small footprint in the corner. From his position on Reza's bed, it looked as if James's stuff had pushed Reza deeper in the corner where he had no place to go, unless he folded himself inward.

The more he thought of that image of Reza forcing himself inward into a shrinking envelope, the more James noticed how much of the room he'd taken over. His extra-long mattress and box springs, the extra-large bed frame, a big-ass inflated ball for stretching his back, a stuffed closet with extra-long pants hanging out. Reza's mess on the other hand, was compacted like his kinny, light framed body. In the doorway, he looked even smaller: narrow in the shoulders and slightly bowlegged, like a waddling penguin in homeboy pants that hung to his knees.

It was the first time James noticed how much he had taken over the space. Thinking back about the apology that Reza had nipped off in the bud, James thought about how he had shoved Reza literally into the corner with the bulk of his body and his big idea that he wanted to hear what James had to say.

No wonder Reza had burst out of the the corner James had pushed him into.

James wasn't just aware of his own cluelessness, he was suddenly shamed and slightly nauseated by it.

He had been thinking of going after Reza to crowd him into compliance. But now, he went against Josh's advice to "get close to him." Give him some space, he thought. Stay in your own lane and and give him some room to be mad.

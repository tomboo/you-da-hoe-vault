James Slides Back

There was this Idaho girl in Shakespeare class- James was surprised that people in Idaho thought Shakespeare had something to say- she was kind of country sexy, with a thing for spangles and cowboy boots. Her notebook had a glossy picture of Shania Twain plastered on the front and big letters that said \"That Don\'t Impress Me Much.\"

Girls in high school had decorated notebooks with collages of kissy lips and sayings like I am Fierce! He knew Idaho was behind the times so maybe the notebook phase was just another part of it, like wearing Converse when nobody in California would be so out about it.

She\'d sat next to him a couple of times and offered to let him look at her test the day Professor Williams gave them a pop quiz. He\'d refused, politely but caught a whiff of Pure Poision perfume.

She passed him a note when Prof. Williams was handing back their tests. James covered up the A- on the top of his paper. She slid her C- in the back of her notebook and he could feel her eyes on him as she read.

\"Got some new weed from Tijuana. Want to try it with me?\"

She walked him out to the parking lot to a dirt-covered Tundra big enough to haul cattle it looked like. When James looked at the mammoth trailer hitch on the back she said she carpeted in barrel riding. He hadn\'t really looked at her closely today; she was turning her back to show him the spargled Indian warbonnet on her back. Queen of the Idaho warbonnet Rodeo \"SInce 1911\" James read out. \"You don\'t look that old.\"

She snorted, not unattractively.

\"What\'s your real name?\" he asked Prof. Williams had this weird habit of calling all the girls Miss so-and_so. Miss Tempter said \"Candy,\" and James snorted. \"Candy Tempter. Now that\' s funny.\"

\"It\'s Tremper.\"

\"Bummer,\" he said, feeling like Tempter was not far off the mark as he watches her expertly rolling a jay.

He glanced around. They were parked in the big parking lot right in front of the Student Commons, where Margaret dropped them off and picked them up. It was close to 3. He had about 10 minutes of freedom.

\"Ladies first,\" he said when she offers him the lighter, so she put it between evenly glossed lips and lit it and sucked in.

James hadn\'t had any weed since the night of the disastrous Tequila and weed and white cross(\_\_look up current speed/drug name) in Topanga Canyon. He inhaled the familiar calming smell and leaned toward Miss Candy who was extending the joint between sharp Life Saver red nails.

Rap! Rap! Rap!

\"James \_\_\_! (last name?) Come out here this minute.\"

Oh holy shit.

Margaret was standing outside of the Tundra, glaring at him like he\'d stolen from her purse.

\"Whoops,\" he said to Candy. \"Gotta go.\"

\"Who\'s she? Your mother?\" Candy\'s eyebrows flicked up with distaste.

\"Um.. no. She\'s kind of a\...\" What should you call Margaret who was like an avenging angel and vaccuum Nazi and van driver rolled into one? \"\...caregiver,\" he finally said.

Rap! It sounded like Margaret\'s taps were gaining strength. In a second, she'd put her fist through the glass.

James yanked open the door and unrolled himself from the seat.

\"Thanks for the Shakespeare notes,\" he said as the smell of weed unfurled around him like a snake. Margaret took his elbow and practically frog marched him two parking spaces over to the van.

\"What are you thinking, you idiot?\" She was in full rant. \"You\'ve been doing so well and now you blow it?\" She turned back, mid-rant and hollered back at Candy who was watching them with widened eyes. \" Stay away from him! Can\'t you see he\'s recovering?\"

Jame felt about two inches high. He couldn\'t believe how easy it had been to pick up a joint that he\'d sworn he wouldn\'t touch again. It seemed so natural, almost banal in its easiness, like being handed a Coke or a drink of water. He hadn\'t even thought about breaking the rules- no one gave a shit about the Inner Journey agreement everybody signed when they got to the program. What appalled him was how easy it had been to go blindly against his own rule for himself.

\"That girl is a skank,\" Margaret said. She made him sit up front with her. Nobody else had arrived yet. According to his watch, James still had five minutes of freedom which he assumed was going to be spent having his ears blistered off by Margaret\'s lecture. Instead Margaret surprised him by saying, \"Good thing I got here early.\"

\"Why? So you could embarrass the shit out of me.\"

\"So I could save you from yourself, nimrod.\"

What the hell was a nimrod? Some kind of Idaho idiot, James decided. Well, she had that right.

\"Are you going to write me up?\"

\"Should I?\"

\"I didn\'t inhale,\" he protested.

Inexplicably, she laughed. A big har-har-har Idaho laugh, unaffected and open. He had no clue what Margaret was laughing at. It was many years before he heard the phrase \"I didn\'t inhale\" at a party with a bunch of people of his parent\'s generation who\'d been around when Clinton was president. It was uncanny how he would remember Margaret\'s laugh like it was yesterday, when he hadn\'t seen the woman for thirty years.

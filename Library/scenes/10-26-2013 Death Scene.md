Death Scene

I\'m writing a novel book ended by death. Story starts with Old Girl escaping the Healing House and making her way down the road until she decides to lay down and let herself be run over.

It circles back to this scene at the climax (which rushes to the end). Old Girl is in the road and Garbage Hank is driving toward her, intent on his plan to take Rachel and keep her like another piece of the flotsam of his life at the dump.

A coyote \-- harbinger of death \-- trots along the river on his nightly hunt and then turns away from the water to cross a white meadow and it is crossing the road toward its den of kits when Hank\'s trunk catches its red eyes frozen on the slick white roadway. Hank\'s hands lift from the wheel and the truck wheels catch on the berm of the road and the truck swerves and almost comes back to the road but gravity takes over on its left-pulling tendency takes over and Hank plunges into a Ponderosa Pine where the steering column \_\_\_\_\_ itself in his chest.

Scene: Coyote circling the Healing House on its normal haunts, smelling the garbage from the kitchen, \_\_\_\_ grease on the dirt.

How does Carla\'s death inform the death scene.

Old Girl cranks the passenger door since the driver side door is crumpled and impossible to open. In the reflected light of the headlights aiming crazily at the splintered trees she sees the steering column sticking into the driver\'s chest. It\'s crushed his sternum and he gasps for breath. In the stillness, the ticking of the still warm engine. It smells of faint caramel. Ponderosa Pine bark scattered by the impact of the vehicle.

He gasps and the black flow that the head lamps which are on \_\_\_\_\_\_ can\'t penetrate, seems to grow grim and darker by the second.

He rouses. She hears a mumble. A \_\_\_\_\_ look on his stubbled face. \"Rachel?\" he says. His expression in that scene\'s at once hopeless and filled with longing.

\"I\'m Hope,\" she says, knowing that any explanation of the reasons for calling herself Old Girl will be beyond his comprehension.

Faith

Hope

What happens is that Old Girl reveals a part of herself she\'s kept hidden. Her real name before she took on the identity of life weariness with the name Old Girl is Hope which she has always though stupid and totally, completely ridiculous and untrue.

She knows this guy is dying. She\'s surprised in fact that he\'s survived the crash the way the hood is buckled and the engine \_\_\_\_\_ back into the cab has pushed the steering column into the man\'s chest.

But for all her longing for death, all the attempts to kill herself have taught her nothing about it. She takes his hand and it\'s still warm even \_\_\_\_ a wet bubbling sound is coming from the open wound.

\"It\'s raining,\" he says at one point.

Does he feel the wetness coming from the spreading pool of black?

I want to translate my own experience of the end of life to this story. His sense of awe at the mysterious process as the body gives its final gasps and the mouth opens and closes like a fish out of its element. That feeling of holding her hand and sensing it go from warm and alive to flaccid and inert.

It\'s seeing the stark reality of death \-- its finality and aloneness \-- that catapults her back into the land of the living. She can feel adrenaline coursing through her. Her heart is pulsing and she feels the vertigo of shock and disbelief and a sudden vast longing to turn the clock back bringing the man back to life.

On the floor of the car from the impact is a weird half human half lobster doll. A tangle of ropes. Duct tape. The glint of metal.

She reches down and brings a pair of heavy hand cuffs into the light. \"Wonder what these are for?\" she asks herself, but shoves them into her backpack in case she has use for them on her travels.

When she walks away from the truck, she leaves the lights burning. They throw their crazed bems into the snow heavy trees that \_\_\_\_ to the sky. The driver is alredy cooling but she is warm in the new red park she\'d found on the floor of the trunk with the tangle of ropes, a shot gun and a bowie knife. It fits her well, as if the giver somehow knew her size, though she has no idea it was purchased for Rachel to warm her during her life as his prisoner.

Old Girl \-- now Hope \-- chooses to stay with the garbageman until he dies. When she sets out wearing the new red park that keeps her warm as she walks toward town as a phone booth to call her \_\_\_\_\_ to come and get her.

Margaret

Margaret is the voice of common sense and pragmatism. She\'s rised 4 kids and they\'re all working, paying their bills and raising their ow kids.

What\'s her dilemma? her husband, the truck driver, is laid up with back \_\_\_\_\_ and she needs a real job, not some no-health-insurance part time work. If Dr. Hazy goes off to Hawaii for vacation the starving dietician slips on the ice and cracks her tibia. Margaret has to step in and take over her job. Possession is 9/10ths of the law, she thinks. Somehow she\'s not worried when she looks up in Hazy\'s files what he\'s paying her when she can cook rings around the woman and fill out the caloric counts like a pro.

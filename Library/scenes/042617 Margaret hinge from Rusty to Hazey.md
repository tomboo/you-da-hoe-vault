042617 Margaret hinge from Rusty to Hazey

Margaret hesitated. There was no reason on earth not to march out of the kitchen with Hazey\'s shoe, get in the Lexus, and drive back to work. All she had to do was nod at Rusty. Say something polite. \"How\'s it going?\" \"Fancy seeing you here.\" \"Long time no see.\"

She snorted. Having a normal conversation with Rusty Harrow was like having a normal conversation with Dr. Hazey. You just never know what strange journey you\'d take.

Was she embarrassed at watching the man eat half a salami that Hazey had tossed in the trash? He was the one who should be embarrassed to be caught eating out of garbage. Maybe that was it. Margaret felt sorry for Rusty and didn\'t want him to know she\'d seen him. He wasn\'t so far gone from humanity was he, that he wouldn\'t care?

Oh, the hell with it. Why not wander around and water Hazey\'s neglected plants until Rusty finished his snack and went on his trask-eating way?

Margaret dutifully filled a juice pitcher and gave the poinsettias gasping on the dining room table a drink. Here it was late January and Hazey\'s Christmas decorations were still around. She picked up a bunch of leaf droppings from the polished mahogany. Then, remembering a spider plant in Hazeys bathroom, took her juice pitcher of salvation back to the master suite.

More plant crappola on the bathroom tile. And ewwww. A balled up pair of boxer shorts dropped outside the shower. There were some things you really didn\'t want to know about your boss.

With her back whingeing from all that shoveling, she opened the medicine cabinet, thinking she\'d grab an aspirin to shut it up.

**Ending**

NEW + GOOD REPORT

.

Progress is slow but steady. I spent considerable time in the last two weeks re-imagining a scene that had problems. It involves a moose breaking through the ice in a frozen lake. I was on the fence about whether the moose lives or dies. So I actually wrote two versions of the scene. Now that I know where I am going (in general), scenes seem to fly out in record time. I didn't write the version where the moose dies until late this week. Both files are in Dropbox but they're not really ready to read so I don't want to waste your time.

Surprisingly, I'm not perseverating about "wasting my time" by creating two tight scenes which advance OG's (main character) arc, in different ways. I seem to be focused on "getting it right" even if it takes more time. I guess I could judge this as either bad (because slow) or good (because it focuses on quality). So for today, I'm taking it as a quality win :-)

I have developed a productive, working habit that feels sustainable and it feels natural and right that I am working every day on the novel. What a change from the stops-and-starts past when I was fighting the edit instead of working with it.

TRICKY BITS

I had intended to have you read the Moose Rescue scene for believability but I think I'll wait on that till I decide if the version where they break an ice channel and its physics sis out or in. I just need a read on whether you can suspend your disbelief.

FOCUS AND NEXT STEPS FOR THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE

I leave for Boston/Rehoboth for the painting workshop on 8/31 and won't be home till September 9. I doubt I'll get any novel work done on the trip. Let's push my next deadline out another week or two. You pick a date that works with your review schedule and let me know.

For the next deadlines, it makes sense for me to switch to overall scene plotting now that I have my most important foundational scenes in place. My goal is to figure out a (changeable) order and write a synopsis of all the scenes. It feels like thinking through scene causality/consequences might help me deep-six scenes that aren't needed.

I found a great video editor to be my BookTok idea partner, so that's big. Another focus is to draft 10 scripts and storyboards for the video concepts.

I'll send you a couple of times for possible meet-ups in Boston in a few days. Hope we can make that happen.

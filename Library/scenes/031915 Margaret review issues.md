031915 Margaret/Review issues

Margaret's two-year anniversary started out bad and got a lot worse.

Gretchen, the Dietician, met her at the front door before she got her coat off and handed her the plumber's snake. She jerked her thumb toward the Boy's Wing and said, "One Sock Hand Job has been at it again."

Before she even got her coat off, she got into it with Gretchen over the oatmeal. All of the kids said it was foul and no one would eat it, so Margaret went into the kitchen to see what the problem was. She took a large spoonful and promptly spit it into the sink. "It's burned!" she cried. "Are you trying to poison them?"

Gretchen, the only certified dietician Margaret knew with a Master's degree in Nutrition who couldn't follow a recipe, wasted no time ratting her out to Dr. Hazey who was having his once-a-week therapists meeting at Healing House.

After that, she broke up a catfight between Esty who was prone to violent outbursts and Danny, who was just plain mean, as far as Margaret could tell.

When Hazey called her into the conference room, Gretchen threw Margaret a Grinchy look. The woman had obviously ratted her out for accusing her of poisoning the kids at breakfast. She'd tasted the gritty, burned oatmeal and promptly spat it out in the sink. "This is inedible!" she'd cried. "Are you trying to poison them or do you just want them to starve?"

If there was anything that made Margaret go ballistic, it was sending kids out the door unfueled for the day.

Shit and shinola. Margaret needed her shitty, low-paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional therapy program in America," which is what Darlene, the head therapist told a colleague on the office phone while Margaret was filling out insurance forms.

It was just a normal day for Margaret until it turned crazy.

Margaret loved kids but that didn't stop her from fantasizing about pushing the face of the hormone-crazed adolescent who kept jerking off in his crew sock into the toilet bowl. She came into work and didn't even have her coat off before Gretchen the Dietician handed her the toilet plunger and a plumber's snake.The powder room john was plugged up for the third time that week because whoever was jerking off kept flushing the evidence and Healing House's plumbing was anything but robust.

Gretchen met Margaret at the front door and handed her a plumber's snake and the toilet plunger like a royal scepter and sword. "One Sock Hand Job has been at it again," Gretchen said. "Middle toilet, back row."

The stutter of the swinging kitchen door tut-tut-tutted in Gretchen's wake.

Margaret understood hormones. She really did. She and her soon to be husband, Hank, had fornicated like rabbits when they were the same age as the kids she supervised at Inner Horizons. Hormones were the reason Margaret couldn't wear a skirt with a waistband to her high school graduation. But she and Hank didn't screw up the rest room toilets for everybody else.

By the time Margaret pulled the unraveling brown-stained crew sock with most of its red stripe still wrapped around the pipe, she'd had three very pissed-off girls who couldn't believe she'd turned off the water valve and were banging on the bathroom door.

When she got wind of a fight brewing in the living room, she flung the dank crewsock in the tub, and she hustled her size 16 butt down to break up Danny's and Etsty's escalating argument over whether Taylor Swift or Lady Gaga was a better singer. Luckily, Margaret was used to dealing with toddlers (she'd raised three of her own) so she used the simple diversionary tactic of getting the girls to guess how much Lady Gaga's meat dress weighed with a promise of a trip to the brand new Krispy Crème store in downtown Couer D'Alene. Whoever got closest to the weight of the T-Bones would get a half-dozen donuts and Margaret would get a moment of peace and quiet so she could fill out the insurance claims because Big Paul had knocked a fist-sized hole in the dry wall next to the dryer when the machine wouldn't give him back his quarters.

Paul was given to fits of sudden violence after weeks of near-catatonic silence. When Margaret had to decide if the hole in the wall was an Act of God or an accident, Margaret picked "Act of God" because presumably Paul had been born that way.

She wasn't prepared for being called on the carpet. Her only warning that all was not well was the grinchy look Gretchen threw her when Dr. Hazey stepped into the kitchen and told Margaret to stop peeling potatoes and come into his office and close the door.

Margaret loved kids but that didn't mean she didn't want to push one of their faces in the toilet bowl that was plugged because someone kept jerking off in his crew sock and flushing the evidence. She understood hormones---hadn't she and her husband Hank had sex like rabbits when they were the same age as the One Sock Hand Jobber---but couldn't the kid give Healing House's fragile pipes a break?

Margaret put away the plumber's snake under the sink and made a mental note to count up all the socks in the boys's drawers and give whoever had the largest number of unmated socks a talking to about the limitations of modern plumbing.

After that, she headed off a crisis at the breakfast table. Gretchen, the only dietician with a Master's Degree in Nutrition who couldn't follow a recipe for oatmeal had singed the bottom of the pan. Instead of throwing it away, she mixed in extra yogurt and tried to pass it off as muesli which none of the kids would eat. When Margaret took a bite, she spat the foul stuff in the sink and cried, "This is foul! Are you trying to poison them?"

She solved the problem of no-breakfast for a dozen kids by going out to her car and dispersing the Krispy Crème donuts Dr. Hazey had asked her to pick up for the weekly case review. The kids were thrilled. The therapists were pissed off. And then she had Dr. Hazey looming over the walls of her cubicle while she filled out insurance forms. Big Paul had punched a fist in the dry wall next to the dryer because the machine stole his quarters. On the form it asked her to check "Act of God?" or "Accident" so Margaret picked Act of God since Paul Christiansen's Asperberg's hadpresumably been caused by a higher power.

"Come in here, Margaret. Close the door," Hazey said.

Gretchen walked by Hazey's office door and threw Margaret her most Grinchy smile which was the first real inkling that the oatmeal comment was going to come back to haunt her. When would Margaret lean to keep her mouth shut?

Hazey rootled around in the file cabinet where he kept the personnel files and Margaret thought about whether she still loved kids. Two Years before, when she answered Dr. Hazey's ad for Day Supervisor at Inner Horizons, the ad had said, "must love kids and be a creative problem sover."

Did creative problem solving with a plumber's snake count? She hadn't acted on her desire to push the One Sock Hand Jobber's head into the john. Really, it was just a fleeting thought.

She hadn't even chastised Lydia for vomiting into a paper bag and hiding the evidence of her bulimic binge in her closet. She'd patted the tiny, starving girl on her Prada-sequinned back and carted two paper bags out to the trash very gingerly. The kid was fragile as an egg shell. Her crazy mom was flying in from New York and that would put anyone over the edge.

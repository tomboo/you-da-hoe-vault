072814 Etsy fork scene

Esty has just gotten back from Stable and she was still in a haze of Seroquel or Ziprexa or whatever anti-psychotic they gave her to calm down. Nobody official would say what was wrong with her. She was always prone to wall-staring and carpet watching but lately, she'd go off on a fit of violence you couldn't predict was coming. Maybe brain damage? Dropped on her head as a baby? Somebody said she came into the Program straight from the hospital after some kind of car crash. A big scar zippered her dull face through one eyebrow and she lumbered with an odd, halting shuffle like her knee or a hip was messed up.

This was where Old Girl disagreed with the rules at Inner Journeys: if somebody "shared" what was wrong with them, it was OK, but God forbid you should ever ask for somebody's story. "Don't ask, never tell" was Old Girl's preferred code. Esty? Who knew what she thought because she never spoke.

All the kids hated her because she had no sense of personal boundaries and she didn't like to bathe. Once, Old Girl was with her in downtown Couer D'Alene for a dentist appointment and Esty dropped her drawers and peed like a cow pissing on a flat rock in an open alley. Every passing car honked when they saw her big white moon of an ass.

She smelled musty and unwashed generally. Today, Princess Leia claimed she hadn't changed her underwear in a week. "Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Go sit over there," she'd ordered Esty when she lumped down next to Leia on a couch. Then Reza held up two fingers like a vampire cross. "Don't you dare stink next to me!" He threw his feet up on the unoccupied half of that couch so she had no place to go unless she sat on the couch arm. Finally, Esty just flopped onto the floor next to Old Girl's feet, using the flat part next to her dangling legs as a backrest.

Even though she didn't talk much, Esty always seemed to want to be around people. She hung on the periphery of any group. Close enough but not willing---not able?---to socialize. She didn't bother Old Girl that much. At least she wasn't Chatty Cathy or Princess Leia, a champion complainer.

Today, though, in her zombified state after Stable, Esty looked so lumpy and sad-sack, Old Girl couldn't stand looking at her. She wondered if general blobbiness and abject misery might be catching. It was bad enough to be her own sorry self without taking on Esty.

It was one of those days when everybody wanted to poke a stick in somebody else's eye. Too cold to hike. The van was in the shop. So no bowling. No grocery shopping. No 'scrip pick-ups or even a stupid trip to the post office which might have distracted them. Darlene tried to cajole the group into going out to build a snow man like they were all six years old but nobody would move off the couch. Everybody said they had homework, or Accountability Reports or Personal Writing to do but once Darlene's back was turned, nobody did them. That left only Esty to torment.

Esty had been at the Program longer than Old Girl. Longer than anyone, really. Nobody could remember when she'd arrived. They'd all stragglled in to the Program after her and she was like a fixture, say a chair or a Naugahyde Barcalounger that they all learned to step over. She'd gotten sent to Stable for some violent outburst that involved her fists or her feet, or once, when Old Girl was new, a curling iron that she clocked a therapist with in a fit of anger. Most people gave her a wide berth rather than chance a sock in the jaw but earlier in the day, she'd arrived so zonked out on Seroquel , it was as fun as poking a giant sloth.

Rachel, who sat next to Esty at dinner, wanted to know what was up with her, but Old Girl didn't want to get into it. She didn't go out of her way to defend Esty, but she didn't exactly feel like picking on her either. There were a lot of reasons Esty could be psychotic and violent---she was stuck here, wasn't she?---and she certainly wasn't on the Speedy Cure based on how long she'd been yo-yoing back and forth between Stable and Intensive. If she ever got to Transitions where you escaped lock-down during the day, Old Girl thought it would be a miracle.

The afternoon poke-fest had been focused on Esty's smell. Somebody --Paul, the bi-polar fat kid, called her a barge, then Leia said no, she was a tanker, and of course, Reza, ADHD, meth-addicted and just plain mean, started calling her Stanker. By the time dinner rolled around, they were all doing it. "Hey Stanker, pass the salt" and "Hey Stanker, you're snorting your food" kind of bull-shit.

"I'm not Stanker," Esty finally said to Reza, mulishly.

"If you take a shower tonight, you can be Tanker," Leia said. "You smell like baby shit."

> Etsy said, "I have a baby. Why shouldn't I smell like baby shit?
>
> Rachel's eyebrows whipped up like a window shade. "You do? Where is he?"
>
> "She. Her name is Esther."

By that point, the whole group was looking at Esty who was inhaling the only roll she was allowed.

"What? My mom is taking tcare of her till I get out."

Reza said, "You're lying. There's no baby."

Only Old Girl noticed the quick quirk of Esty's mouth. Was she waking up from her antipsychotic haze? Was she baiting them?

"She's mine. Mom's just babysitting."

"You're a stinking liar," Reza said.

"Am not."

"Are too."

"You call me Stanker one more time and you'll be sorry," Esty's eyes were narrowed and she clutched her fork, tines up, in a meaty hand.

"Lying sack-of- stinking-shit Stanker!" said Reza.

"Dick!" Esty leaned forward almost casually and drove her fork into the back of Reza's hand.

Reza started up out of his chair, screaming, but he only made it half-way up. His hand was pinned to the table by Esty's heavy torso and both forearms, as she drove the fork deeper into the oak through the meaty part of his flesh between his thumb and index finger.

No dessert after that. Who wanted to eat after the sickly sweetness of seeing someone who deserved it get exactly what was coming?

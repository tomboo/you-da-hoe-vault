**4:33 AM**

THE SIX-PACK OF BEER RUSTY HAS BEEN DRINKING is five down, One Rainier left, in a stranglehold of plastic rings. He pats his breast pocket. Feels for the zip ties he\'s stashed there. The container is fitted with handcuffs. Grappling hooks and pulleys are hung with nylon ropes. Everything in the bag but the baby.

His welcome gift to his girl is a doll baby with its eyeballs prized out. He's welded them to short but flexible springs so the eyes on the doll goggle and jounce and bounce with the truck as he grinds the gears over icy ruts. A shaving brush with a quiff of black hair forms its head. The white handle makes an expressionless face. He's particularly proud of the pink conch shell he's found for a penis. It's sharpened at the end like a spike.

Steering with his knee, he fumbles for the last beer, grappling the plastic ring with both hands. He's thinking about whether to circle around back to 7-Eleven for another six-back, or should he do it after. He might be too excited.

Bright feral eyes freeze in the high beams. A red unearthly glow. Darkness made darker by the startled red.

Dog? Wolf? Fucking coyote? The truck shimmies and sways. Then the front wheel catches a deep rut. The truck lifts off. He doesn't see the body lying in the road at the curve because he's too busy wrestling the left-pulling steering wheel, trying to heave the weight around without touching the brake, with one finger still stuck in the pull tab of the beer. The truck, heavy and high weighted with a full load of tall garbage cans, jumps the berm with all its gravity and weight behind it. It plunges toward the looming Ponderosa pines. The last thing Rusty sees are his hands thrown up to protect his face from a huge tree that hurtles towards him.

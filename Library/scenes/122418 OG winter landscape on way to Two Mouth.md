122418 OG winter landscape on way to Two Mouth

The creek bed was silvered with aspen trees, rusty with ferrous rocks that stuck up out of the snow, some of them green with lichens and moss.

As the van drove north, OG was thinking about what she normally saw: white, numbing whiteness when the sky was the color of cement and the cloud cover pressed down on the mountain tops and everything felt heavy and oppressive and still. And yet, seeing pale yellow sedge poke through the snow, a darker, yellow-gold of a weeping willow next to the dark blue of a rushing stream, dark red veinyed-looking rabbit brush that was full of sap, she couldn't help seeing the tiny signs of life. A flicker of magpie tumbled white and black against the sky. A chitter of mountain chickadees through the cracked window. A burnt orange, rusty headed kestrel atop a telephone wire kept intruding on her attention when normally all she could see was numbing gray and obliterating white.

She saw the struggle in nature to stay alive and turned her attention willfully away to restful whiteness, the dead limbs of a blackened spark with branches that had been cleaved off in some ancient lightning strike. Everywhere she looked in the distance, she saw the suffocating blanket of snow. Up close it was a different story.

To distract herself, she chose to focus on the oppressive, lowlying clouds, the dull sameness of winter where the sky, the fields, the clouds, were the same dirty color of gray. The road beneath the van jingled with a repetitive whap-wha-whap of chains against a thin layer of snow and a deep layer of ice.

The colors and sap and small signs of life are visible but she resolutely turned away, choosing to try to satisfy herself with the sameness. It was gloomy grayness that usually worked to convince her that life wasn't worth living. The only solace she dreamed of was to walk deeper into the deep freeze and shut the door when all the signs of life were trying to tell her something different.

The dwellings and people she saw were all fighting winter. They were chopping wood, clearing snow off roof, shoveling snow from sidewalks and driveways to make it easier to get through. She wanted to hell at them. Tell them to quit pushing winter away. It's going to take over if you let it. Stop fighting. It's so much easier to lie down and let the cold and frost put you to sleep. It won't hurt a bit. After a little discomfort, your eyes will drift down, your chin will node and you won't wake up. Story over.

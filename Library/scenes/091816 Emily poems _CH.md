## "I Measure Every Grief I Meet" 

I could muscle past.

Or let it be.

Or chase it

with tears?

I could cook some rice.

How slowly

it absorbs

and plumps

and is eaten.

## 4 a.m. Two Weeks Before

A ballpeen hammer's tat tat tat tat tat tat\--

the flicker drilling the street light pole again?

Is Daj asleep? "Are you awake"?

She's designing a cart with heft enough

to hold the weight of our air conditioner:

the top must slant to match our sills,

the wheels sturdy for rolling in and out

of the closet where we store the ironing board,

vacuum, my dictionary, my Torah,

and volume of thick collected poems,

each one a God-knot, a timelessness, a life

with no obligators, tireless neurons, firing

forcefully as a Porsche. "The cart, Daj says,

must let the air conditioner hang halfway out

the window to suck in air, spew out cold.

The size of one of her ovaries is three times the other

a mass on its surface with nodules and papillae.

Under a microscope, the papillae look like fronds,

the nodule a bay on a rocky coastline.

Black and white. Yes or no---they fit a prediction

of disease. The scenic cells replicate

as Daj remeasures her cart's dimensions.

Outside yellow hawthorn berries begin

their chameleon seasonal journey to burgundy.

The branches are too heavy, too laden, now

to hold the squirrels who have been devouring their crop.

Will any be left for migratory birds?

I wanted to shoot the squirrels

Just as Daj shot

the pack rat with soft koala-bear ears

and webbed, bat-like feet, letting it flatten

and plaster its body against the house,

defying gravity, as capable as an ant at scaling walls.

My flashlight stopped its ascent, froze it in a circular

cellular light. Daj pulled the trigger. The pack rat flew,

wide-eyed into the brush\--buried.

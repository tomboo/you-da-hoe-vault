060916 Lydia gift of cat bag goes to Lorenzo

In the end, she had to browbeat Lorenzo into walking her over to the consignment shop across the street from the Lake Coeur D'Alene Resort. Plenty of tourist trade to support the store. The shop woman's eyes rounded in amazement at the sight of the Judith Lieber kitchen bag.

After a lot of haggling in which Lydia showed off her ancient Jewish sheep trader genes, they walked out with four hundred dollars in crisp green bills. Lorenzo could not get over the fact that anyone would pay that much for a stupid purse. Lydia had to push down her impulse to tell him the cat cost 10 times that new.

"I'll pay you back," he kept saying. "It might take me a while."

"It's a gift, you dingdong. You don't pay back a gift. You just have to take it."

He shook his head, a few autumn leaf colored coils springing away from pink-shell colored ears. He seemed to be trying mightily to hang onto his emotions so they wouldn't spill.

The weird part about giving the bag to Lorenzo was that she expected to feel empty. She was crazy about that smirking kitten with its blue winking eye. It was strange and wonderful at the same time. She felt a sense of warmth that expanded in that inner place that always seemed so cavernous and cold. It felt like she had just eaten a nutritious meal that she had no intention of throwing up.

Give and take. It was a new idea to her. As new and shining as the bag on the first day she spotted its glittering sequins and blue-eyed wink dangling at the end of her mother's arm. There and then, she had decided to take it and now, it felt even better to give it away.

"Where'd you get it?" Lorenzo asked.

"Oh, it was my mother's."

"She gave it to you. That's really nice."

Without thinking about it, Lydia said, "Oh, no, she didn't give it to me. I just took it out of her closet."

A long, pale-eyed blink. "You stole it?"

How could Lorenzo, growing up with a bunch of polygamists in gingham dresses, imagine her mother's double walk-in closets stacked high with totes and clutches and briefs and stuff sacks and slings and cosmetic cases covered in python and crocodile and Patagonian leather and suede of all colors. Saks and Nieman's sometimes carried less inventory than she did. Of course, they recycled their stock and her mother hung onto everything she'd ever bought.

"She has tons. She doesn't miss it."

"Did you ask her? How do you know?"

What would be the point of asking Rahel if she wanted her Judith Lieber collectible back because of course, the woman who had everything would want to keep it. Lydia remembered carefully rearranging the Lieber shelf so that the empty space where the kitten bag used to live was filled up with the rest of the glittering eyed menagerie of zebras and giraffes and one giant bumblebee the size of wasp's nest.

"So it's not really yours to give away," Lorenzo said stubbornly.

Time to rescue herself with a partial truth. "I gave her a Balenciaga bag my grandmother gave me for my birthday. It was a fair trade." What she didn't say was that she'd thrown the Balenciaga at Rahel when she announced a year ago on Lydia's birthday that she was getting married to Jason Horvath. Yet another spectacular birthday thanks to Mom.

The little bag was only about eight inches squre and it was molded the shape of a curled up cat. Glittering tiny white beads made the whole thing shine and shimmer. The body of the kitten was a blinding white with one Delft-blue open eye and the other a black lacey wink. The first time she laid eyes on it, the kitten dangled from her mother's arm the night she attended a costume ball at the Prince of Monaco's palace in \_\_\_\_. Lydia, eight year old at the time, was old enough to covet it and young enough to ask for it outright. "Mommy," she said, "can I have your kitty when you come home from the party?" Her mother laughed at her gaily, like she'd just said the funniest thing. "This kitty isn't for greedy little girls," she said. "It's mine."

061316 Lorenzo buys fries

"If you don't want to have sex with me, why'd you buy me French fries?"

"You gave me your coffee yesterday," he said. "Don't you remember?"

"Yeah."

"I was paying you back. Besides, you looked like you could use something hot."

Lydia had stumped into the Student Union in the stupid boot thing that made her look retarded. Two toes on her right foot were frost bitten from the Night of the Shivering Dead.

"What happened to your foot?" Lorenzo asked.

"Nothing. Just a stupid accident."

"Do you want to put it up?" He indicated his big solid knee. "Go ahead. It'll stop it from throbbing."

How did Lorenzo know that it felt like she had a drum attached to her foot that was making its own war dance ? She felt like she hadn't slept for years.

"Anything I can do for you?" He amended his question with a boyish grin. "Anything that doesn't involve money?"

"You just did." She nodded at the boot and hooked a fry and bit off the end. Its warmth and fat and the solicitous way Lorenzo had positioned her leg so that her foot rested on his knee at the dip of her ankle, made her slightly teary. Atonement. The problem was that once she got that freight train going, you couldn't stop the train from running off the fucking track.

"I'm Mormon. Well, used to be," he said.

A whole story was there in that 'used to be.'

She felt a tiny breeze, like a door had just been cracked. She could sense the world beyond her but couldn't see it or ascertain how far away it was or whether blocked by mountains or white capped seas.

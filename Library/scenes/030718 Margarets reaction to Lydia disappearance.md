030718 Margaret\'s reaction to Lydia\'s disappearance

PLOT

Rusty sets fire in order to show off his firefighter uniform to Ginny AND THEN Healing House gets evacuated on a frigid night where OG witness the connection between James & Ginny and wants intensely to be wrapped up in warmth but then is interrupted by the cry of \"Raccoons! Fucking coons\" AND THEN Lydia slips into the blanket huddle and OG is left out in the cold, starting in wonder at the gift of the radioactive blooms that are Margaret\'s paint-ball blasted raccoons decorating the Ponderosa tree like Def-Con ornaments.

1\) Chase witnesses the grapefruit hatted raccoon who looks like his mother and then dies from an overdose after Margaret comes outside and tries to blast the damned coons to Kingdom Come

2\) Rusty sets the fire with dryer lint which Leah never cleans

3\) OG raises Healing House to the fire and grabs Gabe\'s backpack and hat

4\) POV switch to James or Ginny when they witness Rusy stomping along the volunteer fire perimeter line in anger at James getting close to Ginny?

5\) OG POV: OG is glad she remembered to grab Gabe\'s fraying Hello Kitty backpack when she talks to Ginny who is distraught at leaving behind her picture album with the one-and-only ultrasound pix of the Lost Baby. In the yard while the firefighters are doing their work, OG feels remote from the clusters of huddled kids in their pajamas who are all sharing blankets. Because OG has raised the alarm, she has her own down jacket, which fits, and her ears are protected by Gabe\'s dog-eared hat but she still feels intensely cold and she wishes she was in the circle of warmth between James and Ginny, then then her attention is distracted by a growing murmur of \"Coons, raccoons\" when the fire fighters begin to notice the paint-ball stained coons who are lighting up the big Ponderosa in the yard like nuclear Christmas tree lights.

Margaret\'s reaction to Lydia\'s disappearance

The day Lydia didn\'t meet the van at the NICC pick-up spot, Margaret was surprised she was AWOL. Lydia had been doing better, arriving on time \-- once, she\'d even been early \-- and lately she\'d seemed to discover manners that Margaret didn\'t know she had. She\'d actually hugged Margaret for her part in routing Ned Simplot from hooking up with her, a first in Margaret\'s experience.

It just didn\'t add up that Lydia would run away now \-- not when she had connected to that Mormon kid she\'d been meeting for coffee with at the Student Union Building. Darlene had reported at Staff Meeting that Lydia was happy because she made a friend and she\'d made a big deal of differentiating Lorenzo from a fuck-buddy. So what would have made the girl run away?

Margaret had to put her unsettled feelings aside for the moment, though, because she had bigger fish to fry. She\'d been lurking outside Dr. Hazey\'s office waiting for the coast to clear so she could nab him and shut the door for The Talk.

The staff had mounted all the usual Runner protocols. They had watchers at the Gray House Bus Station and the Spokane airport; they\'d reported her disappearance to the police; she\'d made the calls to her mother (flat-lined reaction) and her Grandfather (super upset). Her family ahd been warned to expect to hear from her but they didn\'t. It was like Lydia fell off the face of the earth.

Margaret had a really bad feeling about this. A city girl with no outdoors or wilderness smarts. She hated to think of Lydia lying froze in some snow bank because she\'d slipped and fallen in her high-heeled Ferragamo boots or knocked herself out.

She whistled her two-tone bird whistle to calm herself. But she wouldn\'t go there yet. Lydia was probably riding to Seattle right this minute with some trucker who\'d traded her a blow job for a ride and something to eat. The girl would turn up in a few days with more stories to tell plus a handful of demerits which would put her back at Square One in the Program. The Healing House way. Go backward until backward was worse than growing up and moving forward into adult-hood.

\"Dr. Hazey!\" She spotted her prey spraying flower-scent at the mirror in the bathroom down the hall from his office. \"I need a minute.\"

Hazey\'s shoes matched. That was a good sign, wasn\'t it? Although the man had dark circles and puffy bags under his eyes. His pants and shirt were neatly pressed and thanks to the aerosol spray, he smelled faintly chemical and less than human in the dry winter air.

Margaret wasn\'t worried exactly. More like uneasy and faintly disturbed about Lydia. Kids ran all the time. If they scraped together \$20 bucks, they treated their money like it was enough to stretch all the way to the Bahamas. But she couldn\'t square Lydia\'s running with how much better she seemed to be doing. She\'d seemed more settled. More accepting of being in treatment and the reasons for being here after the Ned Simplot episode. When Margaret clocked Ned with her purse, Lydia had actually thanked her later for stepping in to help her get away from him. Marget was surprised that Lydia actually knew the word, thank you.\" It certainly wasn\'t a part of Lydia\'s regular speech so she was almost gobsnacked the girl actually stpped up and hugged her. She could stil feel her thin back and the wiry arms that came around her and pressed into her pillowby bosoms. How small this girl was, she thought, how unprotected and alone she was. Lydia had even said, \"Have a nice day\" the morning she left the van to go to class at NICC. Another first. If it happened again\-- Margaret caught herself and said, \"Don\'t expect a miracle, you nim-no.\"

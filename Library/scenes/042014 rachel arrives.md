042014 Rachel arrival

No title

When Rachel\'s escorts told her she was going to a psychiatric treatment facility in Idaho she\'d envisioned some kind of industrial lockdown complex with concrete cells and bars over the windows. What she got was a red ranch house out in the woods with a milk box on the front step and a mailbox that looked like a cow.

It was bigger than it looked on the inside. The escorts, Don and Big Jim deposited her suitcases in the front flagstone entryway and a big living room with a river rock fireplace stretched out in front of her, with a dining area dull of shaker furniture to the right. A long hall lined with homemade rag rugs angled off to the right. It was lined with a lot of doorways, all of them closed.

A few of the doors had hand drawn name tags--two to a door frame, so she assumed they were bedrooms.

Margaret, a large haggard-looking woman, dragged one rolling suitcase over the flagstone while Rachel carried the other bag down the long hall to the very last door.

\"Laundry rooms right across from you,\" Margaret nodded at the only open door across the hall with a row of industrial size washers and dryers on a sign that read \"Clean the lint trap to avoid fire.\" Somebody had written in magic marker \"Or not.\"

Margaret sighed when she saw the black letters. She took a sponge from a sink in the corner and tried wiping at them.

\"Typical,\" she said. \"Now you know why magic markers are on the contraband list.\"

Apparently makers weren\'t the only thing that was contraband. Margaret took away her bag of Hershey kisses, her iPhone, a bottle of Excedrin and oddly, all her knitting needles.

\"Sorry,\" she said. \" Too easy to stab somebody.\" So much for keeping her hands busy while knitting socks.

Hazey was proud of Healing House from a distance. You drove down a long driveway that was expensive to plow but the new red paint job made the 1950s ranch house glow like a live ember in a field of dark trees surrounded by a blanket of snow.

He\'d left strict instructions to have the House shipshape for the review team\'s visit. Walls patched, spackled and painted clean white. Carpets vacuumed. The shaker oak chairs and tables lemon-oiled and waxed. As an added touch, something he\'d read in a real estate brochure, he\'d told Gretchen to bake chocolate chip cookies and she\'d looked at him like he\'d asked her to turn water into wine.

\"You want to give them sugar?\" she said.

Margaret had offered to bring some from home but Jesus H. Christ, he'd give his left nut for an employee to do what he told them just once without turning it into World War III.

They\'d finally worked it out that Margaret would do the baking and Gretchen could supervise. They would serve warm cookies and coffee before Hazey took the Review Committee on a facility tour.

Driving up to Healing House, he narrowed his eyes at the sight of a garbage bin tilted on its side. Grapefruit rinds dotted the plowed driveway like a spray of yellow speed bumps. Clumps of green and rotting tomatoes and crumpled newspapers and a dark spray of coffee grounds festooned the snow. A black masked racoon scuttled out of anoverturned garbage can right in his path.

Hazey hit the brakes causing the SUV to fish-tail before the auto lock brakes juddered them a stop. The bold raccoon, now holding a grapefruit half up like an offering between two gray paws, eyed him suspiciously, then hissed.

\"Oh how cute!\" one of the woman in the back seat clapped her hands.

\"Our first wildlife,\" the other woman cried.

Where\'s the gun? Hazey was thinking when to his chagrin, Margaret appeared in the front door like Annie Oakley with her hair streaming behind her and the paintball rifle already raised to her eye.

Kerblooey! A starburst of neon green bloomed on the new painted red fence next to Healing House like a radioactive flower. The raccoon next to the car dropped its grapefruit and scuttled behind a tire. Two more raccoons raised startled heads from the garbage bin and Margaret let loose a volley of shots. Day-Glo orange, pink and purple bloomed on the fence like ian nstant flower garden. The raccoons hauled ass for the trees.

\"Stop! Stop shooting!\" Hazey thundered at Margaret who had her head down while she reloaded paint cartridges into the chamber.

\"Wha-?\"

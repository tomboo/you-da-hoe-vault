09292025 James AND THEN Arc

James' character arc starts with the new girl collapsing in his lap when she starts having an epileptic fit and all he wants to do is keep the body that is being snatched by unseen force in the here-and-now so he holds on tight and commands her to stay and she returns to consciousness and opens her eyes and fills him with giddy relief, though he knows all he did was be there, he learns that being there is better than all the running away that has been his MO until now.

AND THEN

In the chaos of bundling up Rachel to get her to Kootenai Medical, IJmes refuses to have sex with Lydia in the bathroom off the living room because he's still processing the miracle of Rachel coming back to life after she left it when he holds her tight and whispers a fervent prayer to stay. James is wildly relieved that he isn't responsible for losing another human being which is why he can't think of mindless fucking and Lydia slaps the shit of him and calls him a limp dick but for once, he escapes without giving into temptation.

AND THEN

In the van on their way to Two Mouth Lake, James pushes Lydia away and there rage gets them in trouble except that's a good thing because midway to the Lake, Darlene exchanges Rachel, now cleared by Kootenai Medical to hike, while Lydia gets sent back to Healing House as punishment. James's fragile connection with Rachel earlier in the day starts to grow on the snowshoe up to the mountain where they discover a moose who has fallen through the lake ice and is now in danger of drowning. James, at Rachel's urging, stops resisting OG"s crazy idea to break an ice channel the moose can use to swim to shore by building a makeshift Indian travois. James reluctantly donates his arctic tech jacket to ferry the rocks and ties it to the alder branches Rachel and OG break off and then he uses his superior upper body strength with the force of gravity to drag the rocks to the edge of the hole and break a narrow passage. The damn moose, is too stupid or terrified to swim into the channel until James loses his temper and and throws a big rock at it, intending to hit it in the haunches, except he misses and the rock knocks one of the antlers off its head and the wall-eyed creature reluctantly swims to shore. When its hooves feel the shallow bottom , the moose rises from the lake and shakes its body like a massive dog, releasing a rainbow of mist with a fart as loud as a thunder blast before evaporating into the wilderness.

AND THEN

James, Rachel and OG, sweaty and wet with exertion are laughing and crying all at once and slapping each other when they join in a collective hug only to jump apart as if they'd been having sex when the rest of the slow pokes join them. Josh can't believe what they achieved but he makes them run down the trail so they don't freeze to death before they get back to the van.

AND THEN

James Accountability Letter to his parents is supposed to take ownership and responsibility for all the terrible things he did that got him locked up at Inner Horizons but accounting for all the shit he did isn't going well, because James can't account for things he can barely remember in a fog of booze and weed and cocaine and a calliope of uppers and downers, depending on whether he was upside down or sideways. He remembers getting terrible grades and self-medicating with drugs interspersed with sobriety in order to play basketball for the Pepperdine University in Malibu because sports is the only thing he cares about. His only lifeline to sanity gets taken away from him and that's when things truly fall apart on the night of a beach party when he drives home drunk and stoned and picks up a hitchhiker and misses a curve in Topango Canyon where he lands upside down and in his befuddled and concussed state, he leaves the hitchhiker who was breathing when he left to die alone while he goes to sleep at home.

AND THEN

James joins his therapist, Josh, for a Family Therapy Session to read his letter but Dr. Mom and Dad, the CEO of a defibrillator company, are clueless about some of the shit that James was up to and his parents start asking troublesome questions about the first half of the list which is comprised of the lesser sins because he's left the mortal ones at the bottom and when they start quizzing him about writing prescriptions from Mom, the neurologist's scrip pd, things get dicey and he hangs up on them before they even get to the heinous which is when Josh tells James he's not the only outcast in Youdahoe, James is first in line.

AND THEN

James hurts Reza's feelings and pisses him off by calling him Apu and Monkey Man because Reza is a non-stop motormouth and his obsession with popping pimples when he isn't talking an asking questions about sex drive James around the bend. He calls Reza Monkey's Ass in Rachel's presence at dinner and she is appalled at his behavior and stops talking to him and James realizes she's only seen him at his best, when he kept her in the room and befriended her and she supported him and he's ashamed of himself

AND THEN

James tries to make amends with Reza who also isn't talking to him and he asks Reza if he wants to play pingpong, one of Reza's favorite occupations and Reza leaves to play pingpong with Big Paul who never ever says anything but is an idiot savant at ping pong and is everyone's favorite partner. James is left along in the room he shares with Reza and James sits down on his bed and observes how his weight rack and his extra-long bed and all his books have colonized way more than his share of the room and gets a dim but shameful idea of how he's pushed Reza into a corner with all his possessions and entitled whiteness when all the S. E. Asian math whiz wants is a friend.

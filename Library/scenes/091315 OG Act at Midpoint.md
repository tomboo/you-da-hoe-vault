091315 Old Girl Acts

Mid Point

Old Girl worked all day, off and on, on a ten-page paper on Animal Farm. It took forever because Animal Farm was like a fairy tale compared to the Lord of the Flies all around her.

Three feet of snow dumped in twenty-four hours. Even in Idaho, where there was one snowplow for every other car, they couldn't clear the roads. Classes at NICC were cancelled. So few staff made it in to work, Gretchen and Darlene decided to jam everybody into the living room so they could tag team keeping an eye on everybody. "It'll be like going from man-to-man to zone defense," Gretchen said.

The first thing people did was straight from the Nature channel. They all made themselves big in order to make their enemies feel small. Blankets and pillows dragged off their beds, laundry baskets piled with clothes to be folded, People magazines by the stack, World History and Spanish textbooks and half-finished napkin holders from shop and piles of photographs waiting to be put into scrap books, every available surface was occupied. Taking up space worked with cobras and gorillas. Why not psychiatric patients?

Princess Danny, queen of the bulimics, and Reza, her henchman, staked a claim to the entire plaid couch. Danny, six feet tall and an ex-volleyball forward before she got kicked out of Ohio State, stretched out in a corpse-pose like the Queen of the Amazonians while Reza weaseled himself deep in the opposite corner.

James and Rachel took the flowered couch and they let Lydia join them and every other chair and love seat and rocker got dibbed. By the time Old Girl came back after forgetting her notebook, she was forced to sit on the orange shag rug, resting her back against the plaid couch while she wrote.

For the first hour, people were thrilled to have a snow day. No school---yippee! But after close contact with every mental disorder in the DSM, the mood went to hell.

Darlene tried a couple of times to relieve their boredom by organizing games. They chose Monopoly and played it for five minutes until Danny and Reza lobbied for Twister. Then Twister was replaced by Parcheesi and by the time they worked their way through Risk and Trivial Pursuits and Battleship, Big Paul finally got mad and snapped the checkers board in half.

Lunch was some inedible stew thing with floating chunks of unidentifiable meat. Lydia swore an ear had landed in her bowl and once that idea got lodged in people's minds, there was a run on the bathroom and much whining about dying of food poisoning.

Snow came down in relentless never-ending streams and by the late afternoon, even Polly, the perpetual Pollyanna of the group, wanted to put a needle in somebody's eye.

But it was Esty who brought out the long knives. Josh, the only staff member who had four-wheel drive, dropped her off around 4 PM after he rescued her from a two-week stay at Stabilization.

Darlene had to help him drag and shove the fat, lardy girl past all the obstacles in the living room. She was deep in a haze of Seroquel or Ziprexa or whatever anti-psychotic they used to calm her down. By the time they threaded her past all the crap and the bodies in the living room, she was nearly catatonic. They made a feeble attempt to lay her down on Danny's couch but Danny went ballistic and they commandeered the flowered couch away from James and Rachel and Lydia.

Nobody would say why Esty had been locked up in isolation at Stable so long. Usually they sent you for two or three days max. Rumor had it that Esty had gone postal on Ethan, the speech therapist, and she clocked him into next week with his digital clock. Privately, Old Girl attributed her violence to brain damage. She'd come into the Program directly after a bad car crash and a big scar still zippered through one eyebrow on her bovine face.

Everybody at the Program hated her. She had no sense of personal boundaries. Worse, she didn't like to bathe. Plus she lumbered with an odd, halting shuffle and it was embarrassing to be seen with her.

Once, Old Girl had to go with her to a dentist appointment in Coeur D'Alene. Esty couldn't wait to get to the dentist office to pee so she dropped her pants in an open alley. A passing car honked when they got a load of the big white moon of her ass. Save me.

"Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Go sit over there!" Danny started to needle her the minute Darlene left to make a call.

Esty moved toward Reza and he crossed two fingers at her like he held up a vampire's cross. "Don't even think about!" The little shit kicked his feet at until she gave up and scrambled next to Old Girl.

Usually, Old Girl just ignored her. She wasn't a motor mouth like Reza or a whiner and a bully like Danny. Mostly the girl just stared at the carpet and muttered to herself. Today, though, in her zombified sad-sack state, Old Girl couldn't even bear to look at her. If general blobbiness and abject misery was catching like a disease, she didn't want anything to do with her. It was bad enough to carry her own sorrows without infecting herself with Esty's.

"Hey Esty. Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?" Reza asked.

"Don't know."

"A smart ass!" Reza crowed.

Around 5:30 after snoring with her mouth open for the better part of an hour, Esty shook herself awake and lumbered off to the bathroom. Reza got to arm wrestling with Big Paul on the floor while she was gone. One of them kicked over a glass of water Old Girl had left on end table and the couch where Esty had been sitting got doused.

When she got back to the living room, Esty immediately sat down on the wet spot. A wet-seeking missile. The whole room erupted in laughter and Esty's brow furrowed with the dumbest look. Why were people laughing?

Jesus. Was Esty so brain dead that the neurons in her brain took an hour to process that her butt was wet? Apparently.

Reza asked her how it was that she peed in her pants when she'd just come back from the can.

Esty wrinkled her forehead and said, "I didn't."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

More hyena howls and yips. Esty stood and turned a broad, cottage-cheesed behind to the group, trying to peer at herself over her shoulder. She patted with one hand over the dark spreading stain.

Last week, Old Girl had been in the kitchen when Darlene told Margaret they needed to order a rubber sheet for Reza's bed because he kept soaking the mattress.

If Old Girl had been a bed wetter, she would have kept her mouth shut about somebody else that couldn't control his or her bladder. Apparently Reza's strategy was to pile on someone weaker with both feet and his kidneys when he got the chance. Hurting someone else felt so much better than being hurt.

Danny and Big Paul started jeering. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Stinker!" "Stanker!" Piss Queen!" If you came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit, you would starve to death, Old Girl told herself.

Old Girl's rule was to mind her own business. She never engaged in the petty dramas or ongoing meanness at the Program. She could fend off any bullshit aimed at her. Today, all the torture Reza and Danny and Paul visited on Esty seemed well deserved. Stupid Esty. Why wouldn't she fight back? She sat like a lump of Jell-O and let the assholes throw out their jabs and kicks without defending herself. Did they torture her just to see if they could get a rise out of her? Or was it some kind of need to get a reaction to prove they were the strong and Esty was weak? If the bullies weren't already picking on her, Old Girl would have slapped her. "No wonder Esty stinks," she called out. "She's piss poor at holding her water."

When Darlene rang the bell for dinner ("Meat loaf, yay!) It took Old Girl a few minutes to figure out what Danny and Reza's new game was. They'd recruited Paul for their deviltry.

He took up the chair across from Esty on the far side of the dining table and Danny plopped down right next to her while Reza took the seat on her other side. The meatloaf dish was passed and Danny forked up a slice for her, and then slid the platter across the table to Paul, who took a serving, then sent the dish down the table away from Esty. Reza took the platter of potatoes and speared a mount for himself, and sent the serving dish off in the opposite direction. He repeated the action when the butter arrived, then sailed the gray peas over to Danny who passed them up the table on her side. The only food that was allowed near Esty was the spinach salad that everybody hated. Today it was garnished with three paltry egg slices and a lone mushroom.

"Hey, Reza, " Esty's eyes followed the meatloaf platter. "The meat loaf skipped me."

Reza made wide eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Of course you did," Danny interjected smoothly. "After I passed you the potatoes."

Esty's plate held the only midget-sized dinner roll that the Program allowed people on the "high energy protein" diet for fatties. Skinny Reza was busy shoveling half a stick of butter onto Mt. Spudmore on his plate. "What?" Reza said. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't."

Darlene, pontificating at the head of the table, sensed something amiss. She interrupted her rant to Gretchen about how she hated driving on black ice and called down the table, "Esty, how come you're not eating?"

Reza flopped a gush of naked, wilting spinach from the salad bowl onto Esty's plate. "Have some greens, Stanker. They make your shit smell sweet."

Esty frowned down at the spinach with the hungriest look Old Girl had ever seen. For a split second, Old Girl expected her to bawl with frustration. Instead, she reached blindly for her cutlery and one of her big paws hand accidentally knocked the fork to the floor. It jittered, doing a little hop and a swan dive, and it landed tines down and stuck in the shag next to Old Girl's chair.

Esty's shoulders slumped. Staring down at her almost empty plate, she looked as if she had resigned herself to going hungry her entire life.

And that was when Old Girl surprised herself. She leaned over and grabbed the fork. She got up and shoved the fork at Esty, crying, \"Feed your self, dammit! Nobody\'s going to do it for you.\"

Esty's eyes took in the fork and to Old Girl, it looed as if in that moment, the true nature of a fork was revealed to her. Maybe it was the way Old Girl handed it to her. She'd extended it, not by the handle but instead, she'd grasped it tines first and passed it the way you'd hand something sharp to someone if you wanted them to throw it.

Almost casually, she gripped the fork handle in her meaty fist and drove the tines into the flesh of Reza's hand.

Reza screamed. He tried to bolt upright from the chair, but he was stopped by Esty who threw her considerable bulk over his torso and used her weight to drive the fork deeper.

"Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated a babble of voices. "Bitch!" "Let go!" Stop! Stop! Esty, no!"---while Danny's high pitched laughter went on and on.

Esty, keeping her arm across Reza's chest and holding him down like a struggling child, reached across the table with her free hand and dragged a slice of meatloaf from Paul's plate. She chewed thoughtfully while Darlene and Gretchen both tried to dislodge her grip on Reza's hand.

Old Girl was the only one who didn't move from her seat at the bottom of the table. She watched the herky-jerky bodies around the dining table like a movie reel. Dessert was definitely off the table, she thought.

Feeling slightly nauseated and still hungry, Old Girl started picking up plates and stacking them. When she had a pile, she butted one hip into the swinging door to the kitchen and was stopped by the sight of Danny who was burying her face in a lemon custard pie that Margaret had baked to celebrate Danny\'s departure from the Program.

The kitchen was quiet except for slurping, sucking sounds that Danny was making. Danny stood in profile to Old Girl, her blonde ponytail held away from her face, which was submerged up to the eyebrows in the pie pan.

Old Girl banged the stack of dirty plates down next to the sink. \"What the fuck? That\'s for everybody!\"

Danny continued to lap industriously at the pie as she swallowed filling and clumps of meringue and large globs of crust without seeming to chew. It had only been a few minutes since Esty stabbed Reza with the fork.

Yet the pie for a dozen people was more than half gone.

\"You\'re sick!\" Old Girl cried.

\"Isn\'t everybody?\" Danny looked at Old Girl with a greasy glop of yellow dripping down her chin. \"Why do you think we are locked up here? You\'re just as fucked up as the rest of us.\"

> \"I\'m not!\" Old Girl cried. \"I\'d never hurt somebody like you do.\"

\"You just did,\" Danny used her hand to scoop more meringue into her mouth; her eyes were flat and lifeless as a corpse. "Besides it's my pie for graduating early."

"The hell you graduated. You manipulated your way out of here."

"So?"

"So get your face out of that pie and leave some for the rest of us."

"Make me," Danny said.

Flushed with her success with Esty's fork, Old Girl pushed Danny's head down into the lemon custard and ground her face in as hard as she could. It was a feeling she would remember decades later. She wasn't full exactly, but she was completely, totally satisfied.

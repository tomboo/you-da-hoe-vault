030609 Lights Out

Close to 10 p.m. She had put her things in order. Cleaned up her side of the room. Liberated more hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there was an exit survey, Old Girl would have written *Buy some more hangers* under suggestions for improvement. *Fire the cook* would be good too.

To note or not to note? The problem with noting -- she'd been reading Shakespeare' s (insert title of "Noting" comedy) was that she could think of nothing to say that would make any difference. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Indianans, had tried everything on her behalf. SSRIs, psychotherapy, dialectical behavior treatment, prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies), once (in desperation) some New Age regressionquack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her on the carpet like a rug salesman: all in the spirit of making her "better." Rachel was pretty sure it didn't get any better than this and why make her aunt and uncle pay for better when worse was what she'd finally accepted? Something banal, perhaps, like " It wasn't your fault, " or "You did your best," then. She doubted it would make any difference to those two nice people who, but for fate and a fraying lamp cord, would still be taking their three a year vacations in Hawaii instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Angela\'s treatment. Her parents had left behind a reasonable insurance policy but after three years of "treatment" it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess the money was running out.

Why they did it, Angela couldn't imagine. If she'd pulled the shit on herself that she pulled on them, she'd have tossed herself out on the street. In one of he suicide attempts-herthird? Fourth? -- she'd sled all over the white grout in their new bathroom.they replaced it without a murmur. So no note? Just a cancelled invoice from Inner Horizons with "paid in full" written across it. Old Girl wished she'd thought of the idea before the bookkeeper locked up her office. It would have been easy to make up a business class assignment that she needed it for.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter. "

"Me, too." A pause. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Tina who had borderline personality disorder and high anxiety and who knew what else in a witches brew of genetic malfunctions. Rachel hadn't said more than "Good morning" and "Night-night" since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to life at Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding one.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Angela's writing wasn't going well." You keep sighing. And fiddling with your dreads." Old Girl didn't know she'd been sighing. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. *Angela has a stash of pills hidden in the closet.* That had cost her a trip, early on, to Stabilization where Klonapin turned her into a Zombie.

"Nothing new to report. You can only say 'it snowed' so many times. "

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote," It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

Rachel was looking at her from the confines of her bed. "You're funny. And smart."

"Am not!"

"You are. I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group." Rachel couldn't remember saying anything in Process; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down and endure in silence the emotional shit storms that made the air of Healing House fairly vibrate with anger and hurt and despair.

"What'd I say?"

"Leia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Leia *always* brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring to listen to. Had Old Girl meant what she said? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A dumb job at the Tasty Freeze wasn't going to pay for tuition or school books. She wasn't planning to make a habit of prostitution, she\'d just do it until she had enough for a deposit on a decent studio apartment. Then she could get by stripping. She wasn't big-boobed but she knew she had a nice ass, if the boys at Inner Horizons were any judge.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form. She'd saved up some Benadryl from a bee sting and had them ready to dissolve in the fat, slobby night mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket, the inner one next to her heart, was a hundred dollars she managed to save by a combination of taking back stuff she bought with her allowance (if it was under \$20 bucks, most stores would just give you the cash) and, working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had dropped off to sleep so she was startled when she heard her ask,, "Did I look horrible when I seized?" Old Girl turned her chair around, so she was facing Rachel, who lay on her side, covers pulled up to her chin like she'd tucked herself carefully into bed. "Like a carp." She paused. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel actually snorted at this snorer. "*See*, you are funny." Her smile proved to Old Girl that once again, whenever you told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, she could hear, coming toward their room, Charlene's corduroys wearing themselves out between her rubbing thighs. *Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka.* Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed down the hall, giving Old Girl plenty of time to hit the lights.

Out in the hall. Charlene was stopping at every door way telling people to hit the hay. "I'm just taking a pee," 0ld Girl called to her. Closing the bathroom door from the outside, she made sure Charlene didn't turn and catch her waiting by the door. Charlene's cocoa cup was in the living room, next to a *Self* magazine open to a make-over page. Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight. The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked unbearably sad. Charlene must bring her own canister of whip with her every night. Old Girl wished she'd seen nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the spreading cream.

> \* \* \* \*

At 2 a.m., the beeping of her watch alarm (she'd put it next to her pillow to avoid waking Rachel) pulled her out of deep sleep p. She was so far down in the still dark waters, she didn't want to come up. She consider running-tomorrow night but dismissed the idea because she'd already shot her wad of Benadryl.

Charlene was snoring gently on the couch, mouth open. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. We're all on our own, she told the crystalline splash of stars. She'd never seen so many stars, sharp as cut glass overhead.'cab Way in New Jersey. Had they ever see the Milky Way in Jersey, she wondered. Only at the Planetarium. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted down, as if the stars were shedding light. Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked her boots creaking with every step. A sign that the temperature had dropped into the teens. She had been here so long, she realized she'd turned into an Idahoan. *I speak snow*, she thought, and like Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to curl up in the snow and wait for sleep.

Her plan was to walk three miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by a truck heading south. Then at I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with another long haul trucker. If she got lucky, maybe she could sleep in the cab unless the driver wanted company. She had a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt. Even a five-and-dime special called Greatest Country Western Standards of Nashville. Better than sex, she planned to say. She hoped she got a trucker who thought so.

She'd been walking awhile and was near the bottom of a long hill (she hadn't realized the road was so up and down from a car) when she heard a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct was to get off the road and stand unseen, next to one of the black Ponderosa pines that reached its long fingered branches to the stars. She'd been thinking about the elk at the frozen lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to get up on the ice. That was too painful to think about. Instead, Old Girl saw the moment the elk had given up. The calm that came over its huge dark eyes. The way the sun, which had fought its way through the clouds, caught the antler points with its weakened rays. She imagined the elk sinking down through a column of blue water to the darkness below. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held up toward the receding light.

It would be breathtaking, floating long legs and a radiant, sun-sprinkled glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. Fish skeletons. A wedding ring. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial-blue beast, like the jewels of a ruler of the floating realm.

The engine noise came closer. She was at the dip in the roadway at the bottom of the hill and she was wearing black jeans and a dark jacket. She laid down, on her side, facing the blinding lights and waited for the struggle to end.

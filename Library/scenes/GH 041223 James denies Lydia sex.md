GH 041223 Pavlovs empty dog bowl denies Lydia sex

The bathroom off Process Room was colder than a meat locker. Like everything else at Healing House, it was outfitted in faux-homey Shaker decor of blond oak and bead-boarded walls. Even the toilet seat was wood grain.

Lydia climbed into the old clawfooted tub and stood behind the shower curtain freezing in a hulk of porcelain the size of an ice berg. James had better hurry up or she would shiver herself into an orgasm.

You could say her weirdo cousin David had taught her the power of sex. After weeks of fucking her in the garden shed and the maid's closet and against every available wall, her virginity had been replaced by shame that it felt so good.

It was strange. Early on she thought she craved sex for the orgasms that ripped her head off but later she realized that she did it for the orgasms that ripped her *partner's* heads off. That was what she was addicted to. To make someone gasp and squirm and make the veins in their neck stand out or have the power to make them quake for what only she could give in that moment. It was an out-of-body experience for her that made her forget about being in her own body at the exact moment they were coming right out of theirs.

She never saw David again after that summer she turned 14. He went off to prep school at Phillips Academy in Andover and she spent the next couple of years in Switzerland when Mom was married to Aldo, one of the Fiats. By the time her boobs and hips developed, she was plenty able to defend herself from the likes of her skinny-ass cousin. By 15, she was fucking anyone who could make her buzzer go off.

Who in hell would put a tub next to a kitchen? she wondered. Didn't people in the West get the concept of a powder room? Or was that an East coast thing? There wasn't even a shower head in the little-used bathroom. All the baths with showers were at the ends of the dorm halls. She supposed they'd been added on at some point when they turned the old Idaho farm house into a nut house.

Healing House didn't have enough hot water for 12 people, much less enough to take the chill off a cast iron tub the size of a water trough.

Maybe that's why David took her virginity. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. This was perhaps the only kind thought she'd ever had about her cousin. Was this Inner Horizons shit finally working? She dismissed that idea like a bad smell in the room.

When the door opened and the shower rings jangled like Pavlov's bell, Lydia climbed up James's body faster than Pavlov's dog ate his food. She threw her legs around his waist and James grunted but she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. Suddenly, the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and to her horror she heard the thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' blue eyes widened and locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from hooting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard. Flush. Bang. Then a pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia started to grappleat his belt buckle but James pulled her away from his body.

"I can't," he said. "Not after all that crazy shit with the new girl."

Lydia had a moment of empathy with the epileptic girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Lydia was having at being left empty without any flopping or jerking. "Don't think! Just feel!" she cried because if James didn't get her off before she saw Mom, she was going to fly into a million jagged pieces.

"God, would you just chill?!" James rang the curtain rings a second time with an angry jerk.

Pavlov's dog had an empty bowl.

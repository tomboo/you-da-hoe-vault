**Udahoe**

By Cynthia Hartwig

**Process Group**

Nothing worth processing ever happened in Process Group. Not in Godforsaken Idaho, not in the middle of January, not during a snowstorm that had started in early fall and was apparently going to drag on until spring. Eight of Inner Horizon\'s Young Adults (18-24) were arguing in Healing House's living room about whose turn it was to go first. Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up in Coeur D' Alene, Idaho, everybody in the program called the place Udahoe. Get it? U -- Da - Hoe, for doing whatever stupid fucked up shit that landed you in a residential psychiatric program with people even more fucked up than you.

Old Girl -- she refused to answer to any other name -- had landed at Inner Horizons for trying to off herself. She had three official tries on her record, but she\'d actually been experimenting with death since she was twelve. It just wasn't that easy to kill yourself when you only had the life experiences of a potato bug. Peggy and David (her adoptive parents) had a well- stocked medicine cabinet but it took a lot of trial and error to figure out what was lethal. How was she supposed to know that taking a super size bottle of laxatives would only make her pray to die, instead of killing her outright? Peggy and David had used her parent's insurance money to ship her off to Inner Horizon's Adolescent Program at 15. Now, at 18, she had graduated from Adolescents to Young Adults, where she couldn't see any difference in the level of maturity, unless she counted the improvement in psychobabble. Any moron could spout on about accountability and self-actualization and fulfilling your higher purpose with individual therapy three times a week and once-every-other--day peer groups, like the one underway.

Darlene, the therapist on duty, introduced the new girl like a cheerleader -- "Rachel Interlachen! Yay!" \-- while Old Girl watched an icicle spear on the eaves get longer. The Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. Last night, newbie-Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two Christ-spouting "escorts" in matching ski jackets which meant that Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to avoid a plane ride with their flipped-out, drug-addled, possibly violent and definitely sobbing girl in order to get her out of their hair. She wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." On her muscular arms, where everyone could see them, fresh cut marks. Horizontal marks, not vertical. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like the majority of the girls sprawled on the irregular semi-circle of couches and chairs. *Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a fat cook who ought to have her liver cut out with it for hate crimes against food.*

The newbie's bright and interested look out the picture window to a softly falling curtain of snow telegraphed to Old Girl that she was still in the honeymoon stage with Idaho. She'd swallowed the advertising lie of Idaho: lakes as blue as Stellar's jays and endless diamond sparkled peaks. She had the endless part right. Wait till she was trapped by below zero temperatures that split your head open if you walked around the block and emotional dramas fifty times a day. Old Girl had to cover her head with a pillow by 8 p.m., she was so exhausted by all the anxieties pulsating in the air. An escape to anywhere, even the grave, seemed like nirvana. All her failures had inured her to the sense of suicides' permanence; she had tried to kill herself so often, she was convinced she was doomed to come back for more suffering. Ground Hog Day, a movie she had watched with her mother in the happy haze of childhood was the way she thought of life and death. You tried to kill yourself in ever-inventive ways and you always woke up to make another attempt. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

"Let's welcome Rachel to her new family!" chirped Darlene who was so cheerful they all wanted to strangle her. Family! Everybody slouched in the oversized living room was just as fucked up and dysfunctional as a real family, except none of the participants would have forked out \$12, 000 a month for the pleasure of sharing their genes. Darlene's voice took Old Girl back to an ancient memory of nap time, when Mom would give her a graham cracker and let her lie on her bedspread while listening to stories with happy endings. Here, there were no graham crackers -- at Inner Horizons, you snacked on carrot sticks and celery between meals because of the overload of anorexics and bulimics in the program -- and no stories that Old Girl knew of with happy endings. There was James Olson, the loser of the argument about who had to 'take ownership of his behaviors' first: Inner Horizon speak for admitting what major screw-up landed him here.

James, 19, surfer-blond, not yet used to his height (he was famous for tripping over his own feet) ticked off his sins in a flat voice. "Substance abuse, alcohol abuse, DUI, school suspension, had my license taken away and...." James pinched the area between his eyebrows, like it hurt his head to remember, "...littering."

Yuk. Yuk. Old Girl had heard the joke before. The girls who had crushes on James giggled and smirked.

Maxi Eaton, a pale skinny Texan with an infected nose ring, went next: "An-or-EX-i-A, Bu-LIM-i-a, self-in-JURE --y\..."

Newbie Rachel cast her eyes up to the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. Old Girl felt for her. She wondered if all her cutting had aged her like all Old Girl's suicide tries had aged her. She didn't insist on people calling her Old Girl because she was currently the longest tenured resident of Inner Horizons. Old Girl was how she felt: ancient and achy in her bones and tired of existence, like a hundred year old who lived on deaf, blind, and paralyzed and longed for death as a grateful release.

Next up: Princess Leia, J.A.P. royalty from Westchester, New York. The most annoying little shit on the planet. "Sex addiction, inappropriate touching with a minor, prostitution, sexual harassment of a teacher, lewd conduct..." Here, Leia took out her gum and licked her fingers one by one at James while he reddened and turned away.

"Come on, Leia, we don't have all day," said Darlene.

"And trying to coerce a police officer with a blow job." Leia shrugged elaborately, making her tight black curls bob over diamond earrings as big as tear drops. "It worked with his partner."

So it went around the chairs, across the couch. Cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex, shoplifting, peer violence, theft, assault and battery, sibling abuse, incest, road rage, gambling addiction, exposure, fire starting, property destruction: if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it.

When the circle finally looped back to Rachel, Darlene urged, "Tell us about you. What behaviors do you need to own up to?"

Rachel hunched over, shoulders drawn in as if to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up and swayed for a second, then she pitched backwards, long legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

\* \* \* \*

James got to Process Group late so he didn't hear the new girl's name. It wasn't like being late for Process was a tragedy. Three times a week under the microscope of your peers would make any normal person postal.

Face it, normal felt abnormal in Kook D'Alene, Idaho. James was surrounded by the lame and halt at Inner Horizons, anybody with parents who could pay the freight like James' parents: Dad, CEO of a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a cardiologist, both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, reminded him today in his session. *When are you going to grow up?* Josh asked. James' answer. *You're the professional. You tell me.*

"What the shit?" James cried out when the new girl landed in his lap, her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. He had the unusual perspective of looking at her face upside down. *Exorcist time*. Her pupils rolled up like a window shade to a world of white mapped with tiny red veins.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair and yelled, "Get Bruce!" Then, at Leia, "Call 9-1-1!"

By this time, the girl was flopping like a carp on the carpet and everybody in Process Group perched at the edge of their seats like they were watching *Night of the Living Dead* at the multiplex. James was torn between being thankful to the new girl for providing something different to talk about and feeling appalled at the sight of Bruce, the day manager, kneeling on her elbows while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James and Old Girl were told to hold onto her legs. James grabbed an ankle and felt something like a shock wave circling through her body, around and around, as if he were holding onto a person being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, even though James held on with all his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying on of hands on a person seized by electricity, as if a bolt of lighting had struck her out of the ether -- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. The body has a will and an agenda all its own. His eyes met Darlene's and he wondered if the bodily high-jacking shook the therapist as much as it shook him.

After what seemed like an eternity of convulsions, the blond girl's eyes -- now a bruise-dark blue -- popped open. Her eyes darted around the cluster of unfamiliar faces and James had the impression she was wondering if she'd died and gone to hell. Consciousness -- of what she'd done, not necessarily who they were -- spread over her face in slow-mo. *The monster is out of the closet---and it is me*, James read.

"Are you feeling better?" Darlene was asking her as she struggled to a sitting position. James helped pull her up and automatically squeezed her hand. The fingers were long and thin, fragile as bird bones. She squeezed back, then catching his eye, dropped his hand as if she'd been burned.

Because Healing House was ten miles outside of town, Darlene and Bruce decided to load her into the Suburban and take her to the hospital; it was faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Micah, one of the Junior Counselors, in charge.

After that, Process Group was officially toast. Everybody sat around and replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Maxi Eaton, the anorexic-bulimic who never thought of anything but food, said, "I thought she was going to barf up breakfast." Reza, the Rage Against the Machine fanatic from New Jersey, said, "I was afraid she was going to pee her pants."

"Didn't they know she was epileptic?" Angela, the mean girl who'd been at the program the longest of any of them, was outraged. "What the fuck's wrong with them? The Program should know stuff like that."

Angela didn't deign to speak to James, a short timer of only six weeks (an eternity, in his mind). How was he supposed to know she called herself Old Girl when somebody told him her name was Angela? *Excuuuuuse me*. "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you can plan for," he said. A surprise. Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than give her the chance to rip him apart with her razor tongue. She was pretty scary with that head full of long, cinnamon colored dreads and an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he was familiar with at the bottom of a bottle of tequila.

A mammoth kid named Paul who never *ever* said anything, spoke up. "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to tell him. Everybody stared at Paul like they'd heard a ghost.

"What the hell are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her *skull!"*

They all laughed then and Paul went back to humming his tuneless song. James wasn't sure but he suspected Paul was autistic. He\'d been too busy with his own shit to find out. He felt Leia bump him from behind, the sign she wanted sex. As usual, Leia's timing was impeccable.

**Peer Interaction**

Leia had an itch the size of Godzilla. She had been hoping the newbie would be a boy --a hella-boy with a hella-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed when the longhaired natural blond stumbled into breakfast asking for coffee. The expression on her face when they said she could have herbal tea!

Leia watched James stutter through his list of bad behavior: Darlene's dopy idea of a welcome ritual. James seemed to be confessing his sins to the carpet. A flush crept out of his shirt collar and climbed his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting stoned and shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school? James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Leia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Leia's experience, which was pretty wide, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, its implacability (a word on her G.E. D. vocabulary list) they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

When the new girl fell like a pile driver into James's lap, Leia's first thought was *Hey! Find your own Boy Toy*! The blond started jerking like a prostitute strung out on Angel Dust that Leia had seen near Times Square. *They should have given her the coffee* flashed through Leia's mind.

Leia ran to call 9-1-1 and then, because she didn't know what else to do, sat down in Darlene's chair while the seizure went on and on. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary Leia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's handbag on the floor. A wallet clearly visible at the top. Everybody else was tuned into the horror show so she plucked out a twenty dollar bill in one smooth motion and pocketed it before the twitching stopped.

Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling the blond up to go to the hospital. The coast was clear. Leia nudged James from behind, then slipped into the bathroom first.

She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the tub without any pants. The porcelain claw-foot tub sat on an exterior wall of the old ranch-style house. Maybe it was okay to bathe here in summer but in the middle of winter, you half-expected ice cubes to spill from the tap. Healing House didn't have enough hot water for three showers in a row, much less enough to heat up a tub the size of an iceberg. Leia could hear her nutcase aunt back in her old house in Montreal telling her to "get in and get out!" when Leia wanted to take a bath on a visit. Maybe that was why Karl, her oldest cousin, started crawling into her bed when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. The thought was perhaps the only kind one she'd ever had about kitten-killer Karl. Was this Inner Horizon shit finally working? She dismissed the idea like a bad smell in the room.

The shower rings jingled and Pavlov's dog couldn't have climbed up James' basketball player body and thrown its legs around his waist any faster. James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or simply speechless because she had her tongue deep in his throat. He had just started to kiss her back when the bathroom door barged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes locked on Leia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lip to keep from hooting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard-- that, and the fact that the Pee Clogger didn't bother to wash at the sink.

The door banged shut and a snort of relief flew out of Leia like a caged bird. "Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close." "Not as close as this, big boy." Leia grappled at his belt buckle but James shoved her hands away from his body. '"Don't. There's no way I can concentrate. Not after all the shit that went down today. "

Leia had a momentary flash of empathy with the crazy girl who'd just had her body snatched by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Leia was having inside without any flopping or jerking. "Concentrate? Just don't think!" If James didn't get her off, she was going to crack open like an egg.

The curtain rings were already jangling behind him. Pavlov's dog has an empty bowl. James parting word was 'chill'. The temperature in the tub immediately dropped another twenty degrees.

**Lunch**

Margaret, the Cook, covered a laugh when James accepted Rachel's offer to share her barbecue burger. He stuffed the whole hunk of hamburger into his mouth at one time. It reminded her of the time Pansy, their old lab, grabbed a steak off her plate and swallowed it bone and all without chewing. If Margaret had been in charge (and Leia the Tattletale hadn't raised a stink), Margaret would have let it slide, the rule about not sharing food be damned. James, a tall, skinny drink of water, could use some fattening up. It seemed stupid to not just let the kids help themselves and forget all the fancy nutrition goals and calorie counting. All you had to teach kids about healthy eating was to eat when they were hungry and to quit when they were full. That's how Margaret raised five kids, not a food nut in the bunch.

Darlene, the Head Therapist on duty, slapped a reprimand on James (two points) and just a warning to Rachel (one point); she got the benefit of doubt because she didn't know the rules yet.

Old Girl kept busy during Darlene's lecture by twiddling a matted hair clump in front of her eyes. Why the girl chose to disguise that beautiful Irish-red hair in a rat's nest you could bury a bone in, Margaret had no idea. It reminded her of something Floyd, her husband, said to one of the kids. "Go comb your hair. You look like two squirrels are fucking on your head." A lot of water had gone under the bridge with old Floyd. He couldn't work since he hurt his back. Good thing he still made her laugh.

There was something about that girl that made Margaret shiver. Still waters run deep. Old Girl had pulled the hair clump from the back of her head -- it looked like a rusted Brillo pad yanked into a string \-- and she inspected the wispy end with an expression that made her look both demented and crazily purposeful. A baby-faced bag lady. Well, she *was* still a child, wasn't she? Eighteen at the end of May, Margaret remembered, because she had been on duty the day of her birthday -- Margaret baked her special carrot cake. For a treat, Dr. Ballrich, the founder of the Program, took Old Girl and some other kids for a spin in his speedboat. Some treat when Old Girl somehow got ejected into Lake Coeur D'Alene on a turn. In May, the water was still glacial and nobody saw her go in so it wasn't clear whether it was a suicide try or an unexpected wave. The kid was cagey that way. Always had the angles figured to make her "accidents" look klutzy. Margaret had read her thick file which listed all the suicide attempts and accidents she'd been involved in since she'd arrived. June, July... Thank God, she hadn't tried anything lately. Margaret counted out eight incident-free months since the birthday trip to the emergency room with a concussion, a broken arm and a scalp full of stitches. Fat Dr. Ballrich had leaped in to save her and she came up fighting like a wet cat. Was she just scared of drowning? Or mad about being saved? Then she was too zonked from the concussion to eat any carrot cake. After that, Margaret ordered store bought cakes and nobody complained.

"Great lunch!" Leia emptied her plate in the garbage before Margaret could inspect it. She had the impression the little liar had cut everything up and smashed it together in a flood of ketchup. Who knew if she'd even swallowed two bites? Margaret said "thank you" automatically to Leia's retreating back and decided she'd leave that one strictly to the professionals.

**Outdoor Activity**

Saturday. They were supposed to leave at eleven but everybody was still running around trying to find their snow gear, so it was closer to the crack of noon. Old Girl, ski-hatted, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy down, waited at the front door like a pre-schooler. Where was the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and around her neck?

It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door for Mom to wrestle Gabe into his snowsuit. Because she was three years older, she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding him between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down so she could get his square little foot corked in the boot. At Old Girl's far removal, she half-imagined hearing a pop when the foot finally slipped in. Did it sound like a *bloop?* Or more like a *thwock*? The reverse of a champagne cork, she concluded. What was Gabe doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the happy, sun-dappled Before of her life, and came up blank. Gabe was a smiler-- not like her, a colicky screamer according to Peggy, her mother's sister, and now her guardian with David, Peggy's husband, in the perpetual After. She searched a mind as empty as an ice-covered lake. Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. She used to be able to call him up -- he was a builder \-- by smelling fresh-cut wood. Now when she carried kindling and split logs for Healing House's woodstove, all she smelled was pine and pitch. Dad was gone, escaped up the chimney and released into the frigid air -- even further gone than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a half-blind senior citizen in a Cadillac Eldorado had taken out all three of them.

The sky was its usual color of cement. The Suburban hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how Idahoans said it). A French name from some ancient trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just a pack of kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the storms. Some country western sob song wailed on the radio, *Prayin' for daylight*, *waitin' for that morning sun.* People sang the chorus into fists held like fake microphones. Old Girl had never gotten used to the noise. When Aunt Peggy shipped her out to Idaho after Old Girl ate a bottle of Valium, the first thing she understood had been taken away from her was a quiet place to hear herself think.

Barely five miles out of town, James and Leia got a warning for inappropriate touching (a one) plus they were separated. Now James sat next to the driver in the front seat, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Leia's crotch and Rachel Interlachen slumped against the window next to him. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but she'd checked out okay at the hospital. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Leia in the far back.

Barfland was glacial. Yesterday, Leia had forgotten to mention nymphomania in her list of behaviors. She usually hit people first thing with being a nympho. Anorexia and bulimia and cutting were too lame to brag about. Luckily, Leia had screwed in her IPod and tinny hip-hop rhythms leaked out her ear buds so Old Girl didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Leia had traded oral sex for candy in the past week. Think of blow jobs like money, Leia told her one day.

Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House with endless blue trees and a soundless landscape in which nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About a mile was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature dropped and it started to snow.

The plan was to snowshoe up to some lake north of Priest River. It was supposed to take a couple hours. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head for the van. For the millionth time, Old Girl missed her IPod but it had seen stolen by some asshole two weeks ago. Old Girl had dark plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

\* \* \* \*

The trail climbed gently for a mile, then got steeper in a hurry. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of Intensive to Transition, he wanted to be in shape to play ball again. Would the move to Transition be like moving from one circle of hell to the next? To combat the mind-numbing boredom, he'd been working his way through *The Inferno* from Healing House's rag-tag library, not that he'd ever let on to his parents who had given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but X --Box.

It quieted down once the going got harder. Leia lagged behind. She was in a snit about the warning in the car. James had been wrestling her hand away from his crotch, which was how they got caught. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight was idiotic. Demeaning, like he was a piece of meat. He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary. The incident in the bathtub, when Darlene rushed in to pee (he caught a glimpse of her neon orange ski jacket), would have gotten both of them sent to Stabilization, the medicated gulag somewhere even deeper in the hinterlands of Idaho than Healing House. James wasn't interested in moving lower on Inner Horizon's circles of hell. Intensive already ranked right up there with the frozen lake of ice with Satan chewing Judas in the middle and the traitors to kindred all around.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Leia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the women's bathroom on the community school campus where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (*Progress!* His mother enthused on the phone.) He wondered if there was an Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Leia's motivations had more to do with risk than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for love, he told himself. It would be nice to be liked.

Rachel tramped steadily behind him. He heard she was a runner. She was in pretty good shape. She was keeping up with him and they were way ahead of the pack. Old Girl, on their heels, didn't count because she spent hours on the treadmill every day and James was always having to trade her his allowance so she'd let him have his forty-five minutes of pain. Five bucks! What king of trouble can you get in with a five dollar allowance? Sam, his dealer, had told him about nickel bags, but to James, the days of nickel bags were as far distant as dinosaurs.

The only sound: the schuss-swish of snowshoes. Giant snow-shrouded Ponderosa pines pinched off the intermittent sun so the trail was dim. It wasn't that cold \-- not for Idaho --maybe twenty-five degrees? Rachel stepped on the back of his snowshoe and he almost fell. "Sorry!" she said. James kneeled to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the strap. "It's okay, I was dreaming."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she didn't have the right to make a suggestion. She was still over-awed by Inner Horizon's rules, worried about the stay-together lecture they got from Josh at the trailhead. Old Girl passed them, stepping out of the trail and skirting them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "It's okay. As long as the three of us hang together."

He fell in behind Old Girl. The stillness of the wilderness made him feel miniscule. No foot tracks---just the soft skitter pads of some four footed creature. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone, their next-door neighbor. What he'd really like to see is a wolf. He'd settle for an elk. Something majestic. If he saw an elk, he'd have something safe to talk about with Dad and Dr. Mom on the weekly family therapy call. Family torture call, everybody called it. Why didn't his parents just give it up and accept that he was a loser? Not everybody could be like Susan, his sister, with A's on every report card, Class President, accepted by Yale *and* Princeton which took a month of agonizing dinner time debate while James sat at the dining room table hoping his report card hadn't arrived. He checked the mail faithfully but once he started coming home drunk or stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks? A shit load, apparently.

**\* \* \* \***

Rachel heard it before she saw it. A sound like breaking glass. Thrashing accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl raced ahead up the blue - shadowed trail, followed by James who was fleet as a deer. A thunderous crack. An odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Rachel had ever heard in her junior riding days, got louder, more hysterical, as they ran.

By the time they reached the lake, the moose was already tiring. Rachel could see the cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged pool a hundred yards from shore. A moose floundered in dark, roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. She would lunge part way up, heaving her massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break with her weight. Every time the moose managed to get up on the ledge, another cliff of ice would crack like a whip. The black water was dotted with snow clumps and floating ice that shuddered and bobbed while the creature swam in circles.

"Holy shit," James' voice was awestruck.

"How can we help?" Old Girl's voice went high and tight. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight, she registered the fracture of Old Girl's careful facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind as the moose made another lunge. It had a huge rack of antlers and its eyes rolled in terror as it swam.

"We need a stick!" Old Girl started yanking at a clump of downed wood trapped at the shore. She got her hands on a stout branch and was using her body weight, trying to break it off at the trunk.

"What's it going to hold on with?" James waved off Old Girl's idea. "Don't even think about going out there!"

"Maybe we can lever its body up. Just enough to help it onto the thicker ice." Old Girl ignored him and with both girls jumping, a branch splintered and broke. Rachel had the iceladen branch in her bare hands when the moose made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back. Then it gave up. For a few unearthly seconds, as they gazed in amazement, the sun lit the candelabra points of the antlers with a blaze of fire. Then the antlers slipped soundlessly under, and the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-blotted hole.

Josh started barking at them about not staying with the group the second the rest of the group reached the shoreline. He issued a second warning to James, and Old Girl and Rachel both got ones for ignoring the rules. Rachel was still fuzzy about Inner Horizons' arcane system of "natural consequences," which involved rating points from one to three for everything from not doing household chores to poor peer interaction, whatever that meant.

She opened her mouth to tell the group about the moose but Old Girl slipped sideways, nearly knocking her off her snowshoe. *What the\--?* James busily inspected a clump of sad aspen saplings with some kind of blight. Rachel took the hint. "Jesus, watch where you're going," she said to Old Girl, yanking her foot away.

Josh was the one who finally noticed the jagged hole in the ice. "Looks like something fell through. Anybody guess what?"

Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big the hole is. You can see its claw marks."

James rolled his eyes in disgust. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else noticed the tracks and thought maybe a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, and zebras, along with Godzilla and Dr. Ballrich, the head of the program.

A few light snowflakes ended the nature lesson. Josh called for an about-face before the snow got serious and made them hightail it back to the Suburban. Rachel was still touched that James had tried to squeeze her hand during her seizure. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Or was there a God and the black pants she wore like a uniform had protected her like she hoped. So when James turned away from his sapling with a lopsided little grin, and took up a position right behind her on the way back, as if he wanted to watch over her, her heart gave a tiny lurch.

**Med Check**

Rachel was assigned as Old Girl's roommate so they went to 8 pm Med Check together. The nurse, Gloria, was still counting out pills into a row of plastic cups. Margaret, the cook who pinch-hit wherever they told her to, was reading a chart for a girl named Angela, checking the contents of a little cup of colorful brain candy against a list. Rachel had gotten good at reading upside down in the early days of her epileptic seizures. Since her head felt continually stuffed with cotton-batting, it was the only way she could track what they were giving her. *Angela's cup overfloweth*, she thought, reading the long list of meds on the chart. Almost as many as in Rachel's cup which had all her epilepsy drugs plus anti-anxiety this, anti- depressant-that, and whatever else her therapist felt compelled to try in the continual quest to make her want to get out of bed.

"Who's Angela Livengood?" she asked Old Girl. "I haven't met her yet."

Old Girl arched an eyebrow. "You don't want to. She's a bitch."

Inner Horizons seemed to have a lot of bitches, Rachel thought. Like the one who had rifled her suitcase and stolen her new, never-worn Lulu Lemon pants before she even had a chance to unpack. "How so?"

Angela held up one dread in front of her eyes, making her look cross-eyed. "For one thing, she'll rip your ears off if you call her Angela."

"Why?"

"It pisses her off. It's a stupid name."

"Angela means angel."

"Angel of Death to her."

A grim way to look at yourself. "What does she look like?"

"Like me."

Rachel reflected on Old Girl's long dreads, now collected in a fountain spray of ginger stalks, like a clump of cattails waving on the top of her head.

"I haven't seen anybody else with dreads here. Who's she rooming with?"

Old Girl yawned as if bored with the conversation. "You."

Margaret, finished checking, called out, "You're up, Oldster," and 0ld Girl obediently threw back all dozen or so pills in two swallows, refusing the little glass of water held out to her. Then, like a chick waiting to be fed by the Mama Bird, Old Girl opened her mouth and let Margaret swab under her tongue, between cheek and gums, and she leaned back slightly to let Margaret peer, like a spelunker, into the cave of her mouth.

"How's it going with Abilify?" Margaret wanted to know. "You're on week three."

Old Girl raised up a shoulder to one ear, like a hunchback, and dragged her leg in halting steps toward the door. "Fabbo! Can't you tell?"

Rachel was taking Abilify too and she wanted to say *Give it time* --she remembered how jangly and suicidal she felt the first six weeks until she got used to it. But Old Girl was already waggling her fingers good-bye, Tweety-Bird style.

Rachel called after her, "That Angela girl could be wrong. It could mean Avenging Angel."

"As long as it's not Angela," Old Girl said, "your ears are safe."

**Quiet Hour**

Old Girl wanted a razor in the worst way. If she had a razor, it would only take a second to do the thing that had been bugging her for months.

Rachel was sitting on the end of her bed across from Old Girl, shuffling through a make-up bag. "Damn. I forgot to bring my toenail clippers. Can I borrow yours?"

Old Girl snorted. "They took those away from me the minute I got here."

"How the hell do you clip your nails?"

"I don't. They just grow under my feet. Now they're so long, I don't need shoes."

Rachel actually laughed at this snorer. "If I'd known they'd give me a comedian for a roommate, I wouldn't have made such a stink about coming here."

Old Girl felt the little tug of friendship and dismissed it. Too bad she wasn't going to be around to tell all her suicide jokes. Not that many people appreciated them.

"Yippee! I didn't forget!" Rachel brandished a small pair of nail clippers.

Now it was Old Girl's turn to be amazed. "Didn't they go through your stuff when you got here? That's contraband."

"Toenail cutters?"

"You don't cut your nails deep in the quick? Like every other girl here?"

Rachel looked like she was turning over the idea of clipping her toenails for the pain value. "I'm a cutter, not a clipper. Guess I'm just not that creative. Not like you."

"Me?"

"You're always saying something clever. What else would you call it?"

Truthful was the word that flashed through Old Girl's brain. Truthful. Not clever. Not remotely funny. "You must have pretty low standards."

Old Girl was sorry to see Rachel's wince. For about the millionth time, she regretted the gift of radar for an open wound.

Leia passed their open door with a shit-eating grin. She'd been hogging the bathroom, as usual. "Lights out in three minutes," she said sweetly, grinning like the cat that ate the canary and the coke stash too.

"Bitch" Both girls spoke in unison. Then they laughed at their moment of communion.

On the to the shower room, Old Girl had a flash of inspiration. Cutting nails wasn't the only thing clippers were good for.

"Mind if I borrow those clippers?"

Rachel hesitated.

"I don't have HIV."

"It's not that. It's just..." She leaned against the sink, spreading her fingers and clenching like she was trying to grasp something elusive. "I don't want you to hurt yourself."

"I don't know you well enough to off myself in front of you. Bad form."

Rachel handed over the clippers without enthusiasm and went about her face washing routine. It looked like it required a rocket science degree to get through all the steps .Old Girl went over to the baby changing station that hung on the back wall. She would have done it earlier if she hadn't been stymied by the prohibition on razors in Hair D'Alene, Idaho.

When Rachel finally toweled her face, Old Girl made a show of holding the clippers up in the mirror so Rachel could see her drop them back in her make-up bag. "See. No harm done."

It wasn't till she walked out that Rachel finally noticed Old Girl's handiwork. Old Girl had scraped the "c" off the baby changing station so the type read, "Baby Hanging Station."

Thank God I got a roommate with a sense of humor, Rachel thought. This place would be hell with somebody who was really depressed.

**Lights Out**

By 10 p.m., Old Girl was ready. She'd cleaned up her side of the room. Liberated more hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there was an exit survey, Old Girl would have written *Buy some more hangers* under suggestions for improvement. *Fire the cook* would be next on the list.

To write a note or not? The problem was she couldn't think of anything to say. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Kansans, had tried everything on her behalf. SSRIs, psychotherapy, cognitive behavior drills, prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies), once (in desperation) they took her to a New Age regression quack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her on the carpet like he wanted to ship her back to Iran: all in the spirit of making her "better." Old Girl knew in her heart that it didn't get any better than this and why make her aunt and uncle pay for better when worse was what she'd finally come to accept? Something banal, perhaps, like " \'t wasn't your fault, \' or "\' She doubted whether \'You did your best" would bring solace to those two nice people who, but for fate and Alzheimer's, would still be taking their two vacations a year instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Old Girl's treatment. Her parents' insurance policy was reasonable but after three years of "treatment," it didn't take a wizard to figure the money was running out.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter. "

"Me, too." A pause. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Tina who had borderline personality disorder and high anxiety and who knew what else in her witches brew of genetic malfunctions. She hadn't said much since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to life at Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding one.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Old Girl's writing wasn't going well. "You keep sighing." Old Girl didn't know she'd even made a noise. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. *Old Girl has a stash of pills hidden in the closet.* That had cost her a trip to Stabilization, early on.

"You can only say 'it snowed' so many times. "

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote," It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

"See, you are smart."

"Am not!"

"I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group."

Old Girl couldn't remember saying anything in Process; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down and endure in silence the emotional shit storms that made anger and hurt and despair spew around the house like confetti.

"What'd I say?"

"Leia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Leia *always* brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring. Had Old Girl meant it? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A dumb job at the Tasty Freeze wasn't going to pay for tuition or schoolbooks. She wasn't planning to make prostitution a habit, she\'d just do it until she could save enough for a rent deposit. Then she could get by with stripping. She didn't have big boobs but she had a nice ass, if the boys at Inner Horizons were any judge.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form.

She'd saved up four Benadryl from a bee sting and had the pills ready to dissolve in the Night Mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket, the inner one next to her heart, was a hundred dollars she'd managed to save by taking stuff back stuff that she'd bought with her allowance (if it was under \$20 bucks, most stores would just give you the cash) and, working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had dropped off to sleep so she was startled when she asked, "Did I look horrible when I seized?"

Old Girl turned her chair around, in order to face Rachel, who lay curled on one side, covers pulled up to her chin. "Like a carp." She paused. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel's bell-like laugh proved to Old Girl once again, that whenever she told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, Charlene's corduroys could be heard wearing themselves out between her thighs. *Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka.* Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed down the hall, telling everybody to hit the lights.

"I'm just going to take a last pee." 0ld Girl called to Charlene from the hall. She closed the bathroom door from the outside, making sure Charlene didn't turn and catch her waiting outside the door. Charlene's cocoa was in the living room next to a *Self* Magazine open to a makeover page. Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight. The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked unbearably sad. Old Girl wished she'd been nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the weeping cream.

> \* \* \* \*

At 2 a.m., the beeping of her watch alarm (she'd put it next to her pillow to avoid waking Rachel) sucked Old Girl out of sleep. She was so far under in dark waters that she didn't want to come up. She considered running the next night but dismissed the idea because there was a full moon. Old Girl hated to admit it, but she wasn't wild about the dark.

Charlene snored on the couch, chest gently rising and falling. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. We're all on our own, she told the diamond splash of stars out in driveway. She'd never seen so many stars, sharp as cut glass overhead. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted down, as if the stars were shedding light. Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked. Her boots creaked on the snow. The temperature had dropped. She had been in Idaho so long, she realized, she was becoming a native. *I speak snow*, she thought, and like Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to cover her head.

Her plan was to walk three miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by somebody heading south. At I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with a long haul trucker. If she got lucky, maybe she could sleep in the cab unless the driver wanted company. She had a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt. Tim O'Brien. Also a blue grass band improbably named Mighty Squirrel. Better than sex, she planned to say. She hoped she got a trucker who thought so.

She walked for half an hour. She was near the bottom of a long hill (she hadn't realized the road was so up and down from a car) when she heard a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct was to get off the road and stand unseen, among the Ponderosa pines that reached long fingered branches at the stars. She was thinking about the moose at Two Mouth Lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to get up on the ice. That was too painful to remember. Old Girl was seeing the moment the moose had given up. The calm that stole over its eyes. The way the sun fought its way through the clouds and flamed the antler points with its rays. She imagined the moose sinking down through a column of blue to the darkness. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held regally toward the thinning light.

It would be breathtaking, floating long legs and a radiant, sun-sprinkled glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. A wedding ring. A child's plastic boot. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial-blue beast, like the jewels of a ruler of the floating realm.

Engine noise rumbled closer. In the depression in the roadway, she realized, at the bottom of the hill, it would be difficult to see a dark object on the ground until it was too late. A realization she felt like she'd been groping towards her whole life. She would think more about the run details tomorrow. Maybe plan out the route better. Take a look at a map in an atlas in the library. For the moment, she'd just lie down where the moonlight didn't reach and rest. She scuttled onto the roadway on all fours, hoping whoever was in the car wasn't riding the brake. Lying on her side, she laid her cheek down and let the ice crystals cut into her skin. She faced the high beams and waited for the waters to close over her head.

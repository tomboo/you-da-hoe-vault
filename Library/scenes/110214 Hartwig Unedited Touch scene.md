You-Da-Hoe Novel

Cynthia Hartwig

For two days, Old Girl had been racked with chills, waking and sleeping and waking in that weird half-state between living and dying. This was not her usual wanting and hoping and planning to die; this was garden-variety flu-cold or Norovirus or in her more hopeful moments, cholera.

She didn't really know what time it was when a siren so close it could have been in her dorm room caterwauled her awake. Cocooned in blankets, buried as deep as she could scrunch, head covered in a flannel sheet and weighed down by three scratchy Pendleton blankets with only her nose peeking out, the alarm howled like a screaming baby right next to her ear.

She peered through sleep-crusted eyes through a crack in the blind. She wasn't crazy. A red fire truck filled up most of Healing House's circular driveway.

Images of the dryer fire crackled and raised her hackles. Was the arsonist back? Who the hell was setting Healing House ablaze? For Christ's sake, kids sleep here! Her brain cried in counterpoint to the siren squall. Abruptly, it shut off in mid-squawk like someone had smothered it.

Old Girl clawed the top blanket off her bed and wrapped herself up like an Indian. As far as she could tell, chills had settled deep in her bones and the scratchy tan and yellow wool with the red chevrons barely touched the frigid ache in her bones.

By the time she crept down the hall, using the wall to keep her upright, the front entry was clotted with men in helmets and big black boots. For a second, she thought Healing House had been invaded. The thought was replaced by the sight of a blubbering Margaret being crushed to the chest of a burly bearded man in a blue and neon-striped uniform. Margaret? Crying? She couldn't square the idea of Margaret losing it with the sight of the fire fighter hugging Margaret instead of doing something purposeful like spraying a fire hose or chopping with an axe to stop the flames.

In the living room, a dozen or so large men milled around watching two of them who seemed to be trussing a boy she didn't recognize on the floor. They were packing him like a sausage in something white and waxy like the paper they used at the meat locker.

Black-and-white striped Adidas, then long skinny legs in black, tight hipster jeans, disappeared first. A man in a Kevlar vest that packed his chest like a bullet casing tied a neat half-hitch on top of what she assumed was the head. A body bag? She'd caught a glimpse of a dusky pale face right before he cinched it.

Margaret, still blubbering, started to make sense. "I tried\--I tried---I tried...but his heart wouldn't restart." Her words came out in a rush and the bearded man kept patting Margaret's broad back make made somehow broader by the fire-engine red shirt that the fireman's patting had rucked up, calling attention to her square and motherly ass.

"How long did you do compressions?" he asked.

"Twenty minutes? Maybe twenty-five\>" Margaret sniffed, then she gave the handkerchief he handed her a giant honk, her red eyes bleared with grief. "I called dispatch in, then rolled him onto the floor and started CPR."

"You found him on the couch?"

"Out cold when I came in from those fucking raccoons."

The front door was still open. Cold biting air colonized the entry way and Old Girl felt it reaching out towards where she was leaned up against the wall, knowing something was terribly amiss but too addled to make sense of it.

Perhaps she sighed. Or moaned. Margaret's head came up off the fireman's shoulder and she cried, "Oh, honey, what are you doing out of bed? You don't want to see this."

Margaret's warm bulk in her warm red shirt advanced on Old Girl like a heat seeking missile. She held out her meat-packer arms and the next thing Old Girl knew---Old Girl, who never allowed herself to be manhandled, who always shied away from human contact---Old Girl found herself enfolded onto Margaret's bosom. With her nose pushed to the vee between Margaret's size Double-Ds, she smelled of Tide and wet dog. The giant shirt was soft, warm flannel and her body heat seemed to fuel a crack in the frozen lake of Old Girl's heart. All she could really make out was the faint lub-lub-lub of Margaret's heart though a pop-hissss-szup! would not have surprised her since sound was amplified by the flesh and blood pressed up against Old Girl's ears like two conch shells. Her warmth snuck up on Old Girl like someone throwing a blanket over her head. Instead of feeling smothered, though she was shocked at how safe she felt pillowed against the big woman's breasts.

What could she do? Old Girl leaned into the heat, away from the cold air blasting in the door from the blizzard, and she let Margaret pat her on the back with warm, broad hands.

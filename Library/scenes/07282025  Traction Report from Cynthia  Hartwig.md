Dear Kerry,

NEW + GOOD REPORT

After my editing crisis of 2 weeks ago, I seriously rethought how I am going about editing and arrived at a much improved process. I decided to bite the bullet and work directly with my scene writes which retain the emotion and the rawness I am aiming for. I realized I was working with older drafts of scenes that had been edited before I really knew their purpose.

This involved two weeks of intense searching in my digital files of the last 13 years. It was like an archaeological dig to find all the raw material. I printed everything out (another amazingly time consuming task), then organized files by character with all their specific scenes and writes based on how they move the story forward. The show-and-tell picture below shows 6 piles: the 2 green piles in the middle are the 2 main characters compilations (OG and Lydia); the 2 cream folders on the left belong to the 2 "establishment" characters of Margaret and Dr. Hazey; the two on the left belong to inmates, James and![IMG_2112.HEIC](./media/image1.jpeg){width="6.188889982502187in" height="4.641667760279965in"} Rachel.

I learned that editing teaches you how to do it correctly. Who knows what I was thinking when I started, but I am definitely thinking more clearly about how to tell this story as I figure out my process and fine-tune it. The pile below represents a new dawn on a load of work :-)![IMG_2111.jpg](./media/image1.png){width="3.4549639107611547in" height="4.60661854768154in"}

TRICKY BITS

I put a new file of a rewritten mid-point scene for my main character that I worked on with this new method in DropBox. It's still in progress but it shows me that this method is going to work better than the crazy way I was close-editing like a myopic mole.

I did not finish that final scene that was part of the OG "finale" I turned in last week. That means there's a little procrastination and perfection plaguing me. I find it interesting that not doing something is as edifying as doing it, as long as one is curious as to why. Something about finishing the novel and letting my character go out in the world is hard for me.

ACCOUNTABILITY SINCE I STARTED

•. I've got great momentum, with the usual daily wa-wa-wa natter at a reasonable decibel level. I feel seriously engaged and motivated and best of all, "able" to do this work.

I am working daily and consistently. Nothing like just sitting down and doing the work because it adds up to continuous progress.

•. It makes me happy to report that when I run into a snag--- something I don't know how to do, a scene that's not working, a feeling of perfectionism, etc. --- I have been very successful at moving on to a different task and somehow, magically, the default brain network continues to work on the blockage and somehow, it gets solve.

FOCUS FOR THE NEXT DEADLINE

My focus is to continue working on all the OG scene drafts in order to arrive at a compilation of all her scenes that shows how she changes from beginning to hitting the road.

NEXT STEPS + ACTIONS

My plan is to just keep plugging away on the OG character compilation and arc of change. Finishing this chunk will give me a better handle on the time it twill taks to do the same thing for Lydia, the other main character who is book-ended with OG.

052517 Rachel and Nurse Nan

Nobody really knew the black girl. She arrived right after New Year\'s but they whisked her off to Stabilization after waltzing her through Healing House for a nanosecond. The grapevine had it that she\'d been at Stable for more than two weeks but weirdly, she was taking classes at NICC. \"How\'d she negotiate that?\" everybody wanted to know and the general consensus was that Mommy and Daddy had bought her the extra privilege. What the fuck? Everybody else had to suffer through three months of Intensive which was kind of like prison lock down except they let you walk around the block with supervision.

Rachel went to her classes and slept at Stabilization and she felt really alone with only the dour, uncommunicative Nurse Nancy who was sort of like Nurse Ratched but noisier. Nurse \"Call me Nan\" nattered on nonstop about inconsequential things while she knit an innumerable number of caps for what appeared to be a never-ending family.

Maybe Nurse Nan\--\"Short for Nana?\" Rachel asking, thinking about the dog in Peter Pan in the frilly apron, but apparently not, because Nan said, \"No, short for Nancy.\"

Nurse Nancy had a whole passel of wastrel grand kids who were in and out of jail and good at losing jobs and always coming to her to bail them out. By the time Rachel left quarantine, she knew more about Nurse Nan\'s Piasecki clan than she wanted to.

She arrives at NICC at week after the start of classes but she is deemed fine to catch up in American Lit since she is a good student and besides, she was almost through American Lit when she cut her wrists. A good way to escape finishing that whale of a Moby Dick assignment. The NICC class had a slightly different reading list. Stranger in a Strange Land was apparently a classic in Idaho but not at Welleley. She had already read Huck Fin and Your Eyes are Watching God and Spoon River anthology.

She\'s there but not there, the ghost resident that the kids all knew about through the mysterious underground grape vine that knew everything that happened or was about to happen at Inner Horizons before the management did.

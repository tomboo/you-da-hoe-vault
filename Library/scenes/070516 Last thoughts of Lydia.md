070516 Last thoughts of Lydia

Lydia was in particles and she didn't think she had the energy or the wherewithal to knit herself together again. She longed for rest. For calm. For relief from the pain in her head, from worry for what was leaking out of her that she couldn't stuff back in.

There was no time to scab over. Other, stronger people --people with more to themselves\--would keep going. They would stumble on. Why not stumble and just fall?

Lydia imagined herself in two moments of time.

She hurt and all she could think of was the sharp jagged pain in her lower back. The spot where Jed had kicked her with his cowboy boots burned like blue flame. To distance herself, she flew up above herself on the road that wound relentless down a series of switch backs at every bend.

Tall black trees lined the slope to her right like silent soldiers. A whumpf in the darkness startled her. Just a clump of snow succumbing to gravity. She imagined herself through a raven's eyes. A small white legged, forked creature in a dark hood. Zigzagging down a silent white road. Her path wandered from the tree side up slope to the opposite side of the road which disappeared into thin air. She had to reaim herself every few steps. Whatever Jed had done to her ear with his punches had affected her balance. She couldn't maintain a straight line so she had to stop when she got to the cliff and turn her whole body away from the invitation of thin air.

Time lost all meaning. Clouds skimmed and flowed past the gold coin of the moon. Its light glowed silver against the black fringe of Ponderosas that made her feel tiny and inconsequential. It was hard to think of any life going on in the bare, barren beauty of the Idaho wilderness.

Computer monitor. Cushionless couch. A refrigerator tipped on its side with a pink interior like a mouth. On a flat plateau at the top of a butte, a Barca lounger with exposed springs was set up like a throne among granite boulders. Split snags revealing yellow heart wood and mangled trees with all the branches shot off formed a jagged perimeter.

Once, when Jed shoved her, she tripped over a TV with a screen full of jagged glass. A shard caught her in the palm of her hand and it was the source of some of the blood she dripped behind her like a pen running out of ink.

On the drive up into the mountains to the north of Post Falls, Jed fumed in silence like a furnace. Frankie O glanced at her in the rearview mirror, a frown line between his eyes. She couldn't tell where they were going other than deep into the steep slopes that piled up like shingles outside of Post Falls. The road was plowed until they made a hard right, and then they jolted over snowy ruts for a long time. At least, they reached a clearing on a flat topped butte. The shooting gallery at Signal Point.

Jed had made Frankie O zip-tie her hands behind her when they grabbed her in the NICC parking lot. He yanked her out of the cab by one wrist and wrenched her shoulder the wrong way. When he shoved her to her knees and pushed her face down in the snow, she knew it wasn't going to be pretty. He yanked her boots off first. Tossed them over his shoulder. Then he jerked her pants off her legs heaving at her while her head bounced on rocks buried the snow.

"Better pray now," he said "because you won't know how by the time I'm done."

There was deep snow all around the clearing but the plateau itself had been roughly flattened by cars and a lot of foot traffic. Frankie O had been at the kegger on the weekend. No keg now but beer cans and bottles glinted when the clouds let the moon peep through A Barca lounger sat on top of a large boulder like a throne.

"I'm sorry," she said, when Frankie O unzipped his pants and pulled his purple-gray dick out. "who are you?"

"What's it to you, bitch?" Jed cuffed her on the side of her head as she tried to work Frankie's unprepared dick into action. "He's a cunt who owes me a favor," he said, "just like you."

Apparently the favor involved letting Jed butt-fuck him while Lydia gave him a blow job but whatever Jed was doing to Frankie in the rear interfered with Frankie's ability to keep it up. His dick kept slipping out of her mouth while Jed held him by the hips and thrust at him like a jack hammer.

"Act like you like it, cunt," he told Frankie."

Apparently Jed had some idea of doing target practice. He said he was going to make her kneel on her hands and knees and pile stuff on her back like she was a table top. He called her 'bullet catcher' most of the way into the mountains until he switched to 'bullet stopper' when they reached a flat plateau on top of a small butte.

Jed and the feral kid drive 'so he could get shit faced' and he slapped her on her bare ass through the opening between the seats. They had hog tied her with zip ties at ankles and wrists. "You'll see how fun it is to be fucked up," he said. "Too bad fat ass Maggie Leary ain't here to save you."

She couldn't see anything with her face mashed in the leather upholstery unless she craned her neck to peer through the space between the seats. A bottle of Jim Beam passed back and forth between the driver and Jed like a baton. There were a lot of turns. Once, the truck fishtailed like a dying salmon and Jed said, "Wreck my truck and I'll wreck you." Frankie shrank deep in his brown down jacket and just drove. He reminded her of a turtle who was keeping his neck protected so it didn't get bitten off.

The truck ground up a series of switch backs on a plowed road that made her car sick. Then they made a hard turn and immediately slalomed into something hard with a metallic crunching sound. The truck bounced. Shuddered. "Fucking shit for brains! What'd you hit?"

It turned out to be a refrigerator on its side with a thick mushroom covering of snow. In Frankie O's defense, it looked like drift of snow had formed irregular lumps and bumps in a rough half-circle around the clearing.

"Shoot your fucking foot off, you fucking piss ant!" Jed kept up a nonstop litany of curses at Frankie's O's driving and then he punched him in the stomach and knocked him down in the snow. He went practically apopletic when he realized he couldn't find the key to the gun rack.

After ten minutes of brushing the snow on their hands and knees, Jed cut Lydia's zip tied hands and shoved her to her knees so she could join the search. "Keep hunting and don't get up, cunt, till you find it."

Without any pants, her feet bare except for Smart Wool socks, Lydia felt around obediently until Frankie O called Jed over to take a tab of Ecstasy that he kept in his pocket "in case of emergency."

When Jed stood at the edge of the clearing to piss down at the pissants in Couer D'Alene, Frankie O sidled over to her and told her to stop looking. He stuck his tongue out at her and she caught the glint of a small silver key in the cave of his mouth. It disappeared before she could thank him. "Just what he says and you'll be OK," he said. "At least he can't shoot us."

"We could shoot him," she whispered.

"If things get out of hand," he said.

About an hour later she was wondering what the definition of 'out of hand" meant to Frankie. Shoving, punching, slapped, kneeing, kicking her in the kidneys with his cowboy boots, and choking her with his bare hands had gotten boring. Finally, when Jed told her to stay still so he could carve his initials in her neck with a Bowie knife, Frankie got out of the truck and called Jed over to take a tab of Ecstasy he kept in his pocket "for an emergency."

She fell again and again, stumbling over a computer terminal and bar stool and TV console and a rungless ladder. In one particularly painful fall on a rusty mattress spring, she felt a sharp pain in the back of her thigh and she couldn't get free of the thing that was stuck in her hamstring. Jed yanked her up by one arm and whatever poked into her came with her so that for a second, she was attached to the springs like a jack-in-the-box.

When the Ecstasy finally kicked in, Jed spent the next half hour staggering around the clearing, claiming to be able to see the Northern Lights. The only thing Lydia could see by then---something was radically wrong with one eye---was the glow of the radio dial with Keith Church hitting the guitar face and singing, "Love you baby, like a wreckin' ball."

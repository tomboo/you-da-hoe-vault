092019 Gretchen worries and Margaret plots with Betsy re loan

Gretchen was unsure whether to portray herself as a great cook or a better nutritionist. Why not both? Margaret asked. "You could replace the sugar with applesauce, a little honey. The kids will be thrilled to be getting home-baked cookies and so will the review fat-heads and you'll come off like a genius."

"Good idea," Gretchen said. "When are you going to make them?"

Betsey said, "Dr. Hazey told us the visit was pro forma."

"Are you sure he didn't mean famous?" Drs. Evenson, Matthias and Grayson would remember the dead body, the raccoons and the Stage II concussions for the rest of their dull, academic lives.

"It would be nice to speed up the bank's approval process. Check another check box on the bank's million-and-one forms."

Margaret saw the medic as he proffered a clipboard at her wanting her to witness the time of death before they shipped the kid's body off to the morgue. Was he a check box on the morgue's form?

"Do you ever wonder if you are in the right job?" Margaret asked, apropos of nothing.

"All the time," Betsey said. "But who's going to pay for my tummy tuck?"

"You? You're thin as a sparrow."

"Some sparrow. I'm twenty pounds over what I weighed in high school."

Margaret thought gloomily about telling Betsey she'd gained 20 pounds in one year after Hank's accident.

"The new facility with be great for Couer d'Alene," Betsey said.

"Because it has so many nuts?"

"No silly, because it means Couer d'Alene is coming up in the world. Remember when you had to go to Seattle for anything worse than a broken bone? Gosh, now we'll have our own psychiatric facility with a national reputation.

Hazey had obviously done quite a sell job on the bank executives at Wells Fargo. Margaret was torn between admitting that the national reputation extended only as far as a couple of kids who came rom Chicago and one who'd been kicked out of a program in New Jersey. But as the national reputation rubbed off on her, she let it go. Betsey didn't need to know how many tube socks she'd liberated from the toilet either.

092119 What Hazey wants the loan for

He wanted to make more money, not to work more or learn more or help more patients. He wanted to hire a Chief Operating Office so he didn't have to do more than deposit checks.

Somewhere back in the day, when he was idealistic, he wanted to help solve the miseries of benighted children. But after working for decades seeing kids take one step forward and two steps back, he'd needs drugs to wake him up and drugs to put him to sleep. Helping kids through adolescence was hard, gratuitous work. It took years to see if anything you tried on them worked.

It was like teaching except worse: you tried to stuff knowledge in through their ears and mostly it came back out at you in psych-speak and rage. Those who took in your lessons didn't tell you about it; they left the Program and if they were lucky, your lessons percolated and stewed and bubbled for years and it either came out fermented or tainted with botulinum and very, very rarely, with a glimmer of insight.

"He said he wanted to hire a COO," Betsey said. "Someone to manage the operations because he's so busy."

Margaret hear the word busy and kept her face immaculately impassive. She was seeing the pink scale of male pattern balding through his graying hair while he napped face down on the desk.

"Super busy with all those troubled kids coming out our ears," Margaret said and Betsey nodded to concur that Hazey was a saint.

Busy helping himself to those troubled kids' drugs, Margaret huffed to herself. It was a trick she used to keep herself from popping off with inopportune comments under stress. Literally every second of most days, it turned out.

"He must be inspiring to work for." Betsey's tone implied that either Gandhi or Mother Teresa was on the tip of her tongue, so Margaret steered the conversation onto safer grounds.

"And you, honey, what will you do when the facility expands by 50%?"

Margaret, gobsmacked by the 50% number, opened and closed her mouth. She could feel her back molars grind off another layer of dentin. "I'm not sure."

"You should go for COO," Besty said. "You've got great organizational skills. Don't you remember the Junior Prom?"

"All I remember is ten cords of crepe paper and a bonfire of Kleenex balls," said Margaret.

"Heck, it was the biggest fundraiser in the history of Couer d'Alene High. I'm pretty sure your record still stands."

"Hmmmm." Margaret's most pungent memory of the prom was her first orgasm delivered with great enthusiasm in the back of Hank's dad's Chrysler. She said recklessly, "May I will ask for a promotion."

"Dr. Hazey will be in a good mood when the loan comes through," said Betsy. "Your timing will be good."

If he isn't delirious on valium by then, was Margaret's thought. What had happened to that girl of 17 who believed she could do anything with tissue paper and a dozen rolls of chicken wire.

"It was SO great to see you," Margaret said, as Betsey walked off with her decorous bag of vitamins and ink cartridges. "Thanks for sharing the good news."

Dr. Hazey was going to be gobsmacked by what she did with it.

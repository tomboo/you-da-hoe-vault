**Hartwig Novel excerpt: Chapter 3, Lydia**

Lydia's itch was the size of Godzilla.

She had been hoping the new arrival at Inner Horizons would be a boy. Actually, a hella-handsome-boy with a hella-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed at breakfast when a tall, bleary-eyed black girl named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her there was only herbal tea!

James had stuttered through his accountability list during Process Group when Darlene had the lame idea of "welcoming" the new girl with their sins. He had confessed to the popcorn-coated ceiling while a flush crept up his neck and climbed his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced and fucked up in high school, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of higher education?

James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Lydia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Lydia's experience, which was as wide as her legs could get, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

At the moment Rachel dropped like a pile driver into James's lap, Lydia's first thought was *James is mine*!? The girl was jerking and popping like a girl strung out on Angel Dust that Lydia had seen arrested in Times Square on New Year's Eve. *They should have given her the coffee,* flashed through her mind.

Darlene screamed at Lydia to get a towel and Lydia ran to the kitchen and slammed through the utensil and cutlery drawers. What the hell good was a towel? she wondered, until Darlene rolled up the red and white checked dish rag she brought and forced it between Rachel's teeth. "It's to keep her from biting through her tongue."

Lydia perched in Darlene's chair while the seizure shook the poor girl like a rag doll. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary and gruesome Lydia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's wallet sitting on top of her bag next to the chair. While everybody at Healing House was tuned into the horror show, a twenty dollar bill slid from the wallet down Lydia's black book . She'd been trying out the Goth Girl look and there was no way to do Goth or punk without black nails. Rahel would have a shit fit if she saw her nails but Lydia had never stolen a thing in her life. It seemed in bad taste to take something when she had something like \$20 million in her trust fund and that was chump change in the Bronfman family. But how could she face Mom without nail polish remover?

*You can pay it back* whipped through her mind like the electrical charge that was zipping around the new girl twitching on the living room rug like Frankengirl. Lydia's hand folded the bill into her boot before the charge finished its circuit.

She made a stupid mistake of glancing sideways at OG. Fucking stink eye. OG's nails nails were broken and ragged and chewed down to the quick with red, angry cuticles.

Everyone at the Program called each other nut cases but Old Girl meant it. She didn't need that crazy fuck knowing what she'd done. Lydia felt plenty small enough; how could she feel any smaller when the tiny tyrant that was her mother came to this morning's visit armed with a French manicure and the quirk of a perfectly sculptured eyebrow?

Darlene and Bruce, an associate therapist, were busy bundling Rachel up in a blanket. Lydia came up behind James and nudged him from behind, their private signal. Then she slipped into the bathroom off the kitchen to wait for the scratch that would ease the itch.

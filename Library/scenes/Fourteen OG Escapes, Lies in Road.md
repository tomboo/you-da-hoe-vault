Fourteen

BY 10 P.M., OLD GIRL HAD cleaned up her side of the room and liberated some wire hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there were an exit survey with suggestions for improvement, Old Girl would have written, "If you want people to hang up their clothes, give them enough hangers."

"Fire the cook" would be first on the list.

To write a note or not? The problem was she couldn't think of anything to say. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Iowans, had tried everything on her behalf. SSRIs, psychotherapy, cognitive behavior drills, prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies), once, in desperation, they took her to a New Age regression quack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her up like he was going to ship her back to Iran: all in the spirit of making her "better."

Old Girl knew in her heart that there was no better and why make her aunt and uncle pay when worse was what she'd come to accept? She doubted whether \'You did your best" would bring solace to two nice people who, but for fate and the driver of the Cadillac's early Alzheimer's, would still be taking two vacations a year instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Old Girl's treatment. Her parents' life insurance policy had been reasonable but after three years of treatment, it didn't take a math wizard to figure the money was running out.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter. "

"Me, too." A pause. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Trina who was bi-polar and OCD and who knew what else. Rachel hadn't said much since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding any.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Old Girl's writing wasn't going well. "You keep sighing." Old Girl didn't know she'd even made a noise. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. Old Girl has a stash of pills hidden in the closet. That had cost her a trip to Stabilization. "You can only say 'it snowed' so many times," she said.

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote," It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

"See, you are smart."

"Am not!"

"I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group."

Old Girl couldn't remember saying anything in Process Group; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down in silence while emotional shit storms flew around the house like shrapnel.

"What'd I say?"

"Lydia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Lydia always brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring. Had Old Girl meant it? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A McDonald's job wasn't going to pay for tuition or books. She wasn't planning to make prostitution a habit; she\'d just do it until she could save enough for rent. Then she could get by with stripping. She didn't have big boobs but she had a nice ass, if the boys here were any judges.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form.

She'd saved up six Benadryls from several bee stings and the pills were ready to dissolve in the Night Mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two AM, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket was a hundred dollars she'd managed to save by working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had gone to sleep so she was startled when she heard her say, "Did I look horrible when I seized?"

Old Girl turned her chair around, in order to face Rachel lying curled on one side with her covers pulled up to her chin. "Like a ling cod." She paused. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel's bell-like laugh proved to Old Girl once again, that whenever she told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, Charlene's corduroys could be heard wearing themselves out between her thighs. Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka. Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed down the hall, telling everybody it was time to hit the hay.

"I'm just going to take a last pee," 0ld Girl called to Charlene. She closed the bathroom door from the outside, making sure Charlene didn't catch her exiting the hall. Charlene's cocoa was in the living room next to a Self Magazine open to a makeover page. Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight.

The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked unbearably sad. Old Girl wished she'd been nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the weeping cream.

AT TWO AM, CHARLENE WAS SNORING on the couch, her mammoth chest rising and falling. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. We're all on our own, she told the diamond splash of stars that lit up the driveway. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted, as if the stars were shedding light.

Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked, her boots creaking. The temperature had dropped. She had been in Idaho long enough, she realized, that she had learned to speak snow. Like the sight of Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to cry.

Her plan was to walk two miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by somebody heading south. At I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with a trucker.

If she gets lucky, maybe she can sleep in the cab unless the driver wants company. Old Girl has Travis Tritt and George Jones and Willie Nelson CDs in her backpack. T-Bone Pickens, a blues growler makes her feel like somebody in the delta has lived her pain. It's all in the front pocket of her Hello Kitty backpack to offer up like trucker candy. The backpack was a Christmas present from her mom when she was ten, and it\'s too small for her now but she can\'t bear to give it up. The kitty is half worn off and Margaret has been bugging her for weeks to let her soak it in Spray-n-Wash. It used to be pink and purple and now it\'s gray, old, tattered, and frayed at the edges \-- she had to sew up a corner recently where her pens wore a hole in it. The more tattered it gets, the more she likes it. By the time she offs herself, she hopes Hello Kitty will be completely erased.

Inside the pack is a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt. A blue grass band named Mighty Squirrel. Only in Idaho. Better than sex, she plans to say. She hopes she gets the rare trucker who thinks so.

She walks for what seems like forever. Near the bottom of a slope---she hadn't realized the road was so hilly from a car ---she hears a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct is to get off the road and stand unseen among the cedar and spruce trees that reach long fingered branches to the stars. She's thinking about the moose at Two Mouth Lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to save itself. That was too painful to remember. Old Girl is seeing the moment the moose surrenders. The calm that steals over its dark eyes. The way the sun fights its way through the clouds and flames the antler tines with its sharp rays.

She imagines the moose sinking down through a column of blue to the darkness. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held regally toward the thinning light.

It would be breathtaking, floating legs and a radiant, glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. A wedding ring. A child's plastic boot. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial blue beast, like the jewels of the floating realm.

Engine noise thrums closer. In the depression in the roadway, at the bottom of the hill, it will be impossible to see a dark object on the ground until it is too late. A realization she feels like she's been moving towards her entire life. She will think more about the run details tomorrow. Maybe plan out the route better. Or take a look at a map in the library.

For the moment, she'll just lie still where the moonlight doesn't reach and stretch out. She scuttles into the center of the the roadway on all fours, hoping whoever is in the car isn't riding the brake. Lying on her side, she lays her cheek down ands let the ice crystals cut into her skin. She faces the high beams. And waits for the waters to close over her head.

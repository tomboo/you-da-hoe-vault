032606 Udahoe 3rd draft

**Udahoe**

By Cynthia Hartwig

**Process Group**

Nothing worth processing ever happened in Process Group. Not in Godforsaken Idaho, not in the middle of winter, not during a snowstorm that had started in October was apparently going to drag on until May. Twelve of Inner Horizon\'s Young Adults (18-24) argued in Healing House's living room about whose turn it was to go first. Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up at Inner Horizons in Coeur d' Alene, Idaho, everybody in the program called the place Udahoe. Get it? U- Da- Hoe, for doing whatever stupid messed-up shit that landed you in a residential psychiatric program with people just as messed up as you.

Old Girl --she refused to answer to any other name -- had landed at Inner Horizons almost three years ago for failing to off herself the third time. Her arrival was so long ago that Old Girl barely recognized the loopy girl signature she made on her intake forms the night two Christ-spouting "escorts" in matching ski jackets frog-marched her into the program. Now, at 18, she had graduated from Adolescents to Young Adults, where the level of maturity seemed pretty much the same, unless you counted the improvement in psychobabble which came with the territory of three hours of individual therapy every week and once-every-other--day peer groups, like the one underway.

Old Girl was watching an icicle spear stuck to the eaves of Healing House get longer, while Darlene, the therapist on duty, introduced the new girl to Process Group. The Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. The newbie --Rachel--- had arrived with two burly baby sitters in the middle of the night which meant that Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to avoid a plane ride with their flipped-out ,drug-addled , possibly violent and definitely sobbing darling in order to get her out of their hair. On her arms, so everyone could see them, were fresh cut marks. Horizontal marks, not vertical. Garden variety self-injurer, like eighty percent of the girls on the irregular circle of couches. *Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a fat cook who ought to be stabbed with it for what she does to the food.*

It was obvious the new girl doesn't get the deal yet about Idaho. Old Girl knew she was imagining lakes as blue as Steller's jays and endless mountains with diamond-sparkled peaks. She had the endless part right. Wait till she was trapped by four gray walls and emotional traumas fifty times a day. Old Girl sometimes had to cover her head with a pillow by 8 p.m., she was so exhausted by the anxieties pulsating around 25 troubled souls.

"Let's welcome Rachel to her new family!" Darlene was a chirper. Family was pretty close to the truth. Everybody sitting in the circle of couches and chairs in the oversized living room was just as fucked up and dysfunctional as a real family, except none of the participants would have forked out \$12, 000 a month for the pleasure of being together. Darlene's voice, to Old Girl's practiced ears, took her back to nap time, when Mom gave her a graham cracker and let her lie on her bedspread while she listened to stories with happy endings. Here, there were no graham crackers -- Inner Horizons didn't allow snacks in between meals because of the overload of anorexics and bulimics in the program -- and no stories that Old Girl with happy endings either. There was James Olson, the loser of the argument about who had to go first in 'taking ownership of his behaviors.': Inner Horizon speak for telling the new girl what fuck-up brought him here.

James looked younger than 19, a surfer-blond, not yet used to his gangly body (he was famous for tripping over his own feet). He ticked off his behaviors in a sing-songy voice. "Substance abuse, alcoholic, DUI, school suspension and...." James pinched the area between his eyebrows, like he had a headache. "Littering."

Yuk. Yuk. Old Girl had heard the joke before. A few of the people here less than a couple months cracked smiles.

Maxi, a pale freckly red head with an infected nose ring, went next: "An-or-EX-i-A, Bu-LIM-i-a, self-in-JURE --y\..."

Newbie Rachel cast her eyes up to the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. Old Girl felt for her: what were you supposed to do with the recitation from Princess Leia, J.A.P. royalty from Westchester, New York? Sex addiction, inappropriate touching with a minor, prostitution, sexual harassment of a teacher, lewd conduct, shooting the moon at a police officer. And that was leaving out half the shit she'd gotten in trouble for here.

So it went around the chairs, across the couch. Cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex, shoplifting, peer violence, theft, assault and battery, sibling abuse, incest, road rage, gambling addiction, exposure, fire starting, property destruction: you named it, the Inner Horizons family had taken a crash course in life wreckage and gotten all As.

Rachel hunched over, shoulders drawn in as if to protect her heart. Her face was a rigid mask of Klonapin-affect, newly prescribed.

"Tell us about you," Darlene urged when the circle finally came back around. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Rachel opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood, and stepped a few feet into the circle. Her eyes rolled back in her head and she pitched backwards, knees buckling over the coffee table, straight into James Olson's lap.

> \* \* \*

James wasn't there when the new girl was introduced. He'd been late to Process Group because his therapist, Josh, was late for individual therapy so they went 15 minutes over. It wasn't like missing out on Process was a big deal. Three times a week under the microscope of your peers would make any normal person postal.

Normal. That was a joke. James was surrounded by the lame and halt at Inner Horizons, all the abnormal with parents who could pay the freight just like James' parents had paid: Dad, CEO of his own company, and Dr. Mom, a clinical researcher, both of whom were used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh had reminded him of today in his session. *When are you going to grow up?* Josh had asked. *You're the professional. You tell me.*

"What the shit?" he said to Ophelia, next to him on the couch, when the new girl stood up. James expected her to walk out, go to the can. Instead, her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. She went over like tree trunk pulled up by its roots, falling towards him, and when he caught her by the shoulders, he had the unusual perspective of looking at her upside down face into the whites of her eyes. *Exorcist time*. Her pupils were completely lost.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get a wooden spoon!" she yelled at Leia. "Somebody get Bruce and call 911!"

By this time, the new girl was flopping like a break-dancer on the carpet and everybody in Process was sitting forward on the edge of their seats like they were watching Chain Saw II at the multiplex. James was torn between being thankful to the new girl for providing something new to talk about and feeling appalled at the sight of Bruce, the day manager, forcing a spoon between her teeth while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James and Reza were instructed to hold onto her legs and James could feel something like a shock wave circling through her body, around and around is if he were holding onto a person being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, even though James was holding his leg down with his full strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying on of hands on a person seized by electricity, as if a bolt of lighting struck out of the ether-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process group wisdom. After what seemed like an eternity of convulsions, the blond girl's eyes --light blue, almost opalescent-- popped open. James had the impression the new girl was looking up him and the other faces clustered around her and wondering whether she'd died and gone to hell. Consciousness -- of what she'd done, not necessarily who they were -- spread over her face in a slow motion wave of horror. *The monster is out of the closet---and it is me*, James thought he read.

"Are you feeling better?" Darlene was asking her. She was still holding the spoon she'd removed from her mouth and James saw shame pouring out of her pores while she pretended to memorize the carpet pattern. When she struggled up, James, still holding onto her leg, surprised himself by squeezing her hand. The fingers were long and thin, fragile as bird bones. She squeezed automatically back, then catching his eye, dropped James' hand as if she'd been burned.

Because Healing House was ten miles outside of town (all the houses had lame-oh names: Responsibility Row, Accountable Cabin!), Darlene and Bruce decided to load the new girl into the Suburban and take her to the hospital; it was faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Micah, one of the Junior Counselors, in charge.

After that, Process Group was officially toast. Everybody basically sat around and replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Maxi Eaton, the anorexic-bulimic who never thought of anything but food, said, "I thought she was going to barf up breakfast." Reza, the Iron Maiden fanatic from New Jersey, said, "I thought she had to go to the bathroom."

"Didn't they know she was epileptic?" Angela, the mean girl who'd been at the program the longest of any of them, was outraged. "Shouldn't they be more careful?"

Angela wouldn't deign to speak to James, a short timer of only six weeks (an eternity, in his mind). How was he supposed to know she called herself Old Girl when he mistakenly called her Angela? *Excuuuuuse me*. "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you can plan for." James surprised himself by standing up to 0ld Girl. Usually he avoided her rather than give her the chance to rip him apart with her razor tongue. She was pretty scary with that head full of long, cinnamon colored dreads and an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he was more familiar with at the bottom of a bottle of tequila.

A mammoth kid named Paul who never *ever* said anything, spoke up. "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like they'd just heard a ghost.

"What the fuck are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her *skull!"*

They all laughed then and Paul went back to humming his tuneless song. James wasn't sure but he suspected Paul was autistic. He\'d been too busy with his own shit to find out. He felt Leia bump him from behind, the sign she wanted sex. As usual, her timing was impeccable.

**Peer Interaction**

Her itch was the size of Godzilla. Maybe Megazilla. Leia had been hoping the newbie would be a boy --a hella-boy with a hella-itch itch to match. She had been seriously bummed when the long haired blond girl stumbled into breakfast that morning asking for coffee. The expression on her face when they said she could have herbal tea!

She put James under the microscope while he stuttered through his list of behaviors in Process Group: Darlene's dopy idea of a welcome ritual for the new girl. James seemed to be confessing his sins to the popcorn-coated ceiling. A flush crept out of his shirt collar and began climbing his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school? James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Leia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Leia's experience, which was pretty wide, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, its implacability (a word on her G.E. D. vocabulary list) they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

At the new girl's turn to show her underwear, she stood up like a dumb ass. You could have knocked Leia down when the new girl fell like a pile driver into James's lap. Why James? She started jerking like a girl strung out on Angel Dust that Leia had seen near Times Square. *They should have given her the coffee,* flashed through Leia's mind.

Leia ran for the wooden spoon that Darlene screamed at her to get -- *what, are they going to beat her with it?* -and then, because she didn't know what else to do, sat down in Darlene's chair while the seizure went on and on. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary Leia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's bag crammed into the chair seat with her. The wallet was clearly visible at the top. Everybody else was tuned into the horror show so she picked out a twenty dollar bill in one smooth motion and had it safe in her pocket before the twitching stopped.

Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling the blond up to go to the hospital. The coast was clear. Leia nudged James from behind, then slipped into the bathroom first.

She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the tub without any pants. Some brainiac had installed the old porcelain claw-foot tub on an exterior wall of Healing House. Maybe it was okay in summer but in the middle of January, you half-expected ice cubes to spill from the tap. Nobody in their right mind ever took a bath in here; Healing House didn't have enough hot water for twelve people, much less enough to heat up a tub the size of an iceberg. Leia could hear her nutcase aunt back in her old house in Montreal telling her "get in and get out!" when she wanted Leia to take a bath in the winter. Maybe that was why David, her cousin who was three years older, started crawling into her bed when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. The thought was perhaps the only kind one she'd ever had about kitten-killer David. Was this Inner Horizon shit finally working? She dismissed the idea like a bad smell in the room.

What in hell was taking James so long? She had heard the Suburban rumble past the window on the way to the hospital, she thought.

Then the shower rings jingled and Pavlov's dog couldn't have climbed up James' lanky body and thrown its legs around his waist any faster. James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He had just started to kiss her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes locked on Leia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lip to keep from hooting aloud.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard-- that, and the fact that the Pee Clogger didn't bother to wash at the sink.

The door banged and the snort flew out of Leia like a caged bird. "Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close." "Not as close as this, big boy." Leia grappled at his belt buckle but James held her hands away from his body. '"Don't," he said. "There's no way I can concentrate. Not after all the shit that's gone down today. "

By then, the itch was like jungle drums. "Concentrate? Just don't think!" Leia had a momentary flash of empathy with the crazy girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Leia was having inside without any flopping or jerking. \"Pleeeeeease!" The word came out like a whine, but she couldn't help it. If James didn't help her get off, she was going to fly into a million jagged pieces.

The curtain rings were already jingling behind him. Pavlov's dog has an empty bowl. "Just chill," James said on his way out. The temperature in the tub dropped another twenty degrees.

**Outdoor Activity**

Saturday. Outdoor Activity day. Everybody was running around trying to find their expedition wear. Old Girl, ski-hatted, gloves in her pocket, sweating in puffy down at the front door, feIt like a pre-schooler. Where's the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and over her neck?

It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door for Mom to wrestle Gabe into his snowsuit. Because she was three years older, she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding the baby between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down so she can get his square little foot corked in the boot. At Old Girl's far removal, she half-imagined hearing a pop when the foot finally slipped in. A *bloop* instead of a *thwock*? The reverse of a champagne cork's pop. What was Gabe doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the happy, sun-dappled before of her life, and came up blank. Gabe was a placid baby -- not like her, a colicky screamer according to Peggy, her mother's sister, and now her Guardian with her husband, David, in the perpetual After. Her mind went as frozen as an n ice-covered lake. Something was eating her happiest moments around the edges of late. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. She used to be able to call up Dad, a builder, by smelling fresh-cut wood. Now when she carried kindling and split logs for Healing House's woodstove, all she smelled was pine or pitch. Dad was gone, carried up the chimney and released into the frigid air -- even further gone than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a half-blind senior citizen had crashed into all three of them.

The sky was the usual color of cement. The Suburban hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how Josh told them to say it). A French name from some ancient trapper who was looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just a park of kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the relentless blizzards. People were singing to the radio that was tuned to some country western sob song. *Prayin' for daylight* ,*waitin' for that morning sun* they all screamed into fists held like fake microphones. Old Girl had never gotten used to the noise. When Peggy shipped her out to Idaho after eating all her Valium, the first thing she understood had been taken away from her was a quiet place to hear herself think.

James and Leia already had a black mark (a rating of one) plus a warning for inappropriate touching barely five miles away from the house. Now James sat next to Josh in the front seat, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Leia's crotch. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Leia in the far back. Barfland was glacial. Yesterday, Leia forgot to mention nymphomania in her behavioral introduction to Rachel, the new girl, who was now slumped against the window next to James. Being a nympho was the first thing Leia usually hit you with. Anorexia and bulimia and cutting were too outcognito to brag about. Luckily, Leia had borrowed somebody's IPod and emitted tinny hip-hop rhythms from her ear buds so Old Girl didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Leia has traded oral sex for candy in the past week.

Instead, Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House, with endless blue-tinged trees and a frozen landscape in which nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About a mile was Old Girl's calculation. Less if it was snowing.

Josh, the leader, planned to make them snowshoe up to a mountain lake that fed into the main Lake Pend Oreille. It was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head for the van. The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt like she was always being assaulted. You live with eighteen troubled adolescents and the first thing you realize they confiscated from you was quiet. Old Girl was used to wearing her IPod but it had seen stolen by some asshole two weeks ago. Another IPod was stolen this week. You didn't catch old Girl whining about it, like Leia, next to her, jerking her head to the beat. Old Girl had darker plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

> \* \* \* \*

The trail climbed gently for a mile, then got steeper in a hurry. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of Intensive to Transition, he could play basketball again and he wanted to be in shape. Would the move to Transition be like moving from one circle of hell to the next? At night, he'd been working his way through Healing House's rag-tag library to combat the mind-numbing boredom. He was in the middle of *The Inferno*, not that he'd ever let on to his parents who had eons ago given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but X --Box.

It quieted down in a hurry once the going got harder. Leia lagged several people behind him in a snit. She was mad about getting a warning in the car, even madder at James because he'd been wrestling her hand away from his crotch, which was how they got caught. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight was idiotic. Demeaning, like he was a piece of meat. He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary. The incident in the bathtub, when Darlene rushed in to pee (he caught a glimpse of her neon orange ski jacket), would have gotten both of them sent to Stabilization, a medicated gulag somewhere even deeper in the hinterlands of Idaho than Healing House. James wasn't interested in moving lower on Inner Horizon's circles of hell. Intensive already ranked right up there with Paolo and Francesca's hellish windstorm.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Leia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the men's bathroom on the lame community school campus where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (*Progress!* His mother enthused on the phone.) He wondered if there was an Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Leia's motivations had more to do with risk than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for eternal love, he told himself. It would be nice to just be liked.

The new girl, Rachel, tramped steadily behind him. There was a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but she'd checked out okay at the hospital. She was a dancer so she must be in pretty good shape. She was keeping up with him and they were way up ahead of the pack. Angela --Old Girl was a few steps behind them, but she didn't count because Angela spent hours on the treadmill every day and James was always having to trade her his allowance money so she'd let him have his forty-five minutes of pain. Five dollars! What trouble can you get in with five bucks? Sam, his dealer, told him one time about nickel bags, but to James, that was as far distant as the days of the dinosaurs.

The only sound: the schuss-swish of the snowshoes. Giant snow-shrouded pines pinched off the dim sun. It wasn't that cold \-- not for Idaho --maybe twenty-five degrees? Rachel stepped on the back of his snowshoe and he almost fell. "Sorry!" she said. James kneeled to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the strap. "It's okay, I was lagging."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she didn't have the right to make a suggestion. She was still in the honeymoon phase with Inner Horizon's rules, worrying about the stay-together lecture they got from Josh at the trailhead. Angela passed them, stepping out of the trail and skirting them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "It's okay. As long as the three of us hang together."

He fell in behind Angela. The stillness of the wilderness made him feel miniscule. No foot tracks---just the soft skitter pads of some four footed creature. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone, their next-door neighbor. What he'd really like to see is a wolf. He'd settle for a moose. Something majestic. If he saw a moose, he'd have something safe to talk about with Dad and Dr. Mom on the weekly family therapy call. Family torture call, everybody called it. Why didn't his parents just give it up and accept that he was a loser? Not everybody could be like Susan, his sister, with A's on every report card, President of the Student Body, accepted by Yale *and* Princeton which took a month of agonizing dinner time debate while James sat at the dining room table hoping his report card hadn't arrived. He checked the mail faithfully the minute he got home but once he started coming home drunk or stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks? A shit load, apparently.

> **\* \* \* \***

Rachel heard it before she saw it. A sound like distant breaking glass. Then thrashing and gnashing accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Angela raced ahead up the blue- shadowed trail, followed by James who was fleet as a deer. A thunderous crack. An odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Rachel had ever heard in her junior riding days, got louder, more hysterical, as they ran.

By the time they reached the lake, the elk was already tiring. Rachel could see the cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged pool a hundred yards from shore. An elk floundered there, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. She would lunge part way up, heaving her massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break with her weight. Every time the elk seemed to get up on the edge, another cliff of snow-covered ice would crack off like a whip. The black water was dotted with snow clumps and floating ice that shuddered and bobbed while the creature swam in circles.

"Holy shit," James' voice was awestruck.

"How can we help?" Angela's voice broke like an over-tuned harp string. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight of the drowning creature, she registered the fracture of Angela's careful cooler-than-thou facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind while the elk made another lunge. It had huge antlers and starting eyes that rolled in terror as it swam.

"Don't go out there. You'll fall in." James sounded as if he'd already accepted the inevitable.

Angela wasn't having any of that crap. "We need a stick!" She started yanking at a clump of downed logs partially submerged at the lake's edge. She got her hands on a stout branch and was using her body weight, trying to break it off at the trunk.

"What's it going to hold on with?" James eyed Angela as if she were nuts. "Don't even think about going out there!"

"Maybe we can lever its body up. Just enough to help it onto the thicker ice. " Angela was talking to Rachel and with both girls jumping on the branch, it finally began to splinter.

Rachel had the ice-laden branch in her bare hands when the elk made its final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back, and then, as they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its head and body sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of the antlers lit by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above the black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly under, the only sign that the elk had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-blotted hole.

Josh and the rest of the group broke onto the lakeshore and Josh started barking at them in a passed off voice. "What the hell were you thinking?\" You're supposed to stay with the group!" He issued a second warning to James, and Angela and Rachel both got ones for poor peer interactions and ignoring the rules. Rachel was still fuzzy about Inner Horizons' arcane system of "consequences," which involved numbers from one to three for everything from household chores to therapeutic progress, whatever that meant.

Rachel opened her mouth to tell the group about the drowning elk when Angela slipped sideways, nearly knocking her to the ground. *What the\--?* James had turned away from the group, and was acting like he was busy inspecting a clump of sad aspen saplings with some kind of blight. Rachel took Angela's glower as a hint. She shut her mouth. "Jesus, watch where you're going," Rachel said to Angela, yanking her snowshoe away.

Josh was the one who pointed out the jagged hole in the ice. Mr. Wilderness in a flannel cap and wool Army-Navy pants. "Looks like something fell through. Anybody guess what?"

Everybody, except Rachel, Angela and James, hazarded an idea. Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big the hole is. You can see its claw marks."

An acne-inflicted boy Rachel hadn't met rolled his eyes in disgust. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else noticed the tracks and thought maybe a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, and zebras, along with Godzilla and Dr. Buchanan, the head of the program.

A few light snowflakes drifted in sideways. That ended the nature lesson. Josh called for an about-face before the snow got serious and told them to hightail it back to the Suburban. Josh, a native Idahoan, had some weird localisms. On the car ride up to the trailhead, he'd yelled back at one of the kids *Shut your pie hole*. Not a phrase Rachel had heard in the Chicago bedroom community of Naperville where she'd grown up until the year her mom was killed in a house fire.

The fire was the demarcation line in Rachel's maturity. Afterwards, she couldn't decide if she was hopelessly older or hopelessly younger than her peers. Epilepsy was just the icing on her Mom-less cake. Hardly worth mentioning, except for the embarrassment of yesterday's performance. She was still touched that James had tried to squeeze her hand. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Had the black pants she wore like a uniform protected her like she hoped? She couldn't see how. So when he gave her a lopsided little grin, and took up a position right behind her on the trail, as if he wanted to watch over her, her heart gave a tiny lurch.

**Lights Out**

Close to 10 p.m. Old Girl had put her things in order. Cleaned up her side of the room. Liberated more hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there was an exit survey, Old Girl would have written *Buy some more hangers* under suggestions for improvement. *Fire the cook* would be next on her list.

To note or not to note? The problem with noting (she'd been reading Shakespeare' s *Much Ado About Nothing* and was aware of nothing as a pun on noting, Elizabethan-speak for eavesdropping) was that she had noted nothing to say that would make any difference. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Indianans, had tried everything on her behalf. Prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies); SSRIs, analysis, dialectical behavior treatment, once (in desperation) some New Age regression quack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her up in a carpet like a rug salesman: all in the spirit of making her "better." Rachel was pretty sure it didn't get any better than this and why make her aunt and uncle pay for better when worse was what she'd finally come to accept? Something trite, perhaps, like "It wasn't your fault" or "You did your best". She doubted it would make any difference to those two nice people who, but for fate and a Lincoln Town Car on senile citizen autopilot, would still be taking their three-a-year vacations in Hawaii instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Angela\'s treatment. Her mom had left behind a reasonable insurance policy (Dad was long gone in another life) but after three years of "treatment" it didn't take a rocket scientist to guess the money was running out.

Why they did it, Angela couldn't imagine. If she'd pulled the shit on herself that she pulled on them, she'd have tossed herself out on the street. In one of the suicide attempts --her second? third? -- she'd bled all over the white grout in their new bathroom. Peggy and David replaced it without a murmur. So no note. Just a cancelled invoice from Inner Horizons with "paid in full" written across it? Old Girl wished she'd thought of the idea before the bookkeeper locked up her office. It would have been easy to make up a business class assignment that she needed it for.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter."

"Me, too." A pen tap. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Tina who had borderline personality disorder and high anxiety and who knew what else in a witches brew of genetic malfunction. Rachel hadn't said more than "Good morning" and "Night-night" since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with Old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to life at Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding one.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Angela's writing wasn't going well." You keep sighing. And fiddling with your dreads." Old Girl didn't know she'd been sighing. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. *Angela has a stash of pills hidden in the closet.* That had cost her a trip, early on, to Stabilization where Klonapin turned her into a Zombie for months until she faked an attack of hives. Old Girl said, "Nothing new to report. You can only say 'it snowed' so many times. "

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote, "It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

Rachel chuckled from the confines of her bed. "You're funny. And smart."

"Am not!"

"You are. I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group." Rachel couldn't remember saying anything in Process; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down and endure in silence the emotional shit storms that made the air of Healing House fairly ping with anger and hurt and despair.

"What'd I say?"

"Leia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Leia *always* brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring to listen to. Had Old Girl meant what she said? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A dumb job at the Tasty Freeze wasn't going to pay for tuition or school books. She wasn't planning to make a habit of prostitution, she\'d just do it until she had enough for a deposit on a decent studio apartment. Then she could get by on stripping. Lots of girls did. She wasn't big-boobed but she knew she had a nice ass, if the boys at Inner Horizons were any judges.

If only she could get up enough energy to care. It was hard to get up, hard to be interested in anything, hard even to breathe. Such a useless effort. They prescribed all kinds of antidepressants: Welbutrim, Lexapro, Paxil, Cymbalta, Zoloft, Prozac, a brand new one three weeks ago called Abilify which she was still taking (they were onto her at med-time, she always got the rubber-gloved finger swab between her lips and gums, under her tongue). She already knew it wasn't working. The gray, ashen world she was used to existing in had turned to charcoal.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form. She'd saved up some Benadryl from a bee sting and had them ready to dissolve in the fat, slobby night mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket, the inner one next to her heart, was a hundred and fifty-seven dollars she managed to save by a combination of taking back stuff she bought with her allowance (if it was under \$20 bucks, most stores would just give you the cash) and working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had dropped off to sleep so she was surprised when she heard her ask, "Did I look horrible when I seized?" Old Girl turned her chair around. Rachel lay on her side, covers pulled up to her chin like she'd tucked herself carefully into bed. "Like a carp." Old Girl twirled a dread. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel laughed out loud, a peal of true laughter as pretty as a bell. "*See*, you are funny." Her smile proved to Old Girl that once again, whenever you told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, she could hear Charlene's corduroys wearing themselves out between her rubbing thighs. *Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka.* Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed toward them from the end of the hall, giving Old Girl plenty of time to hit the lights.

Charlene was stopping at every doorway telling people to hit the hay. "I'm just taking a pee," 0ld Girl called to her from the hall. Closing the bathroom door from the outside, she made sure Charlene didn't see her waiting outside the head. Charlene's cocoa cup was in the living room, next to a *Self* magazine open to a make-over page. *Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight*. The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked deflated and sad. Charlene must bring her own canister of whip with her every night. Old Girl wished she'd been nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the weeping cream.

> \* \* \* \*

At 2 a.m., the beeping of her watch alarm (she'd put it next to her pillow to avoid waking Rachel) pulled her out of a deep cave of sleep. She was so far under in the still dark waters, she didn't want to come up. She considered running the next night but dismissed the idea because she was out of Benadryl.

Charlene was snoring gently on the couch, mouth open. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. *We're all on our own now*, she told the crystalline splash of stars. She'd never seen so many stars, sharp as cut glass overhead. Had they ever seen the Milky Way in Jersey, she wondered. Only at the Planetarium. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted down, as if the stars were shedding light. Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked. Her boots creaked with every step. A sign that the temperature had dropped into the teens. She had been here so long, she realized, she was turning into an Idahoan. *I speak snow*, she thought, and like Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to go back to her bed and sleep forever.

Her plan was to walk three miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by a car heading south. Then at I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with a long haul trucker. If she got lucky, maybe she could sleep in the cab unless the driver wanted company. She had a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt. Even a five-and-dime special called Greatest Country Western Standards of Nashville. Better than sex, she planned to say. She hoped she got a trucker who thought so.

She'd been walking awhile and was near the bottom of a long hill (she hadn't realized the road was so up and down from a car) when she heard a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct was to get off the road and stand unseen, near one of the giant Ponderosa pines that reached long fingered branches to the stars. She'd been thinking about the elk at the frozen lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to get up on the ice. That was too painful to remember. Instead, Old Girl saw the moment the elk had given up. The calm that came over its huge dark eyes. The way the sun, which had fought its way through the clouds, caught the antler points with its weak rays. She imagined the elk sinking down through a column of blue to the darkness below. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held regally toward the receding light.

It would be breathtaking, floating long legs and a radiant, sun-sprinkled glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. Fish skeletons. A wedding ring. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial-blue beast, like the jewels of a ruler of the floating realm.

The engine noise came closer. She realized she was at the dip in the roadway at the bottom of the hill where it would be hard to see a dark object on the ground until it was too late. The idea was like a revelation she had been groping toward in a blinding light. Lying on her side, ice crystals cutting into her cheek, she faced the high beams and waited for the waters to close over her head.

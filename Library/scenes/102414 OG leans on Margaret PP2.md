1102414 Old Girl is Touched\-- PP2 scene

This was not Old Girl's usual wanting and hoping and scheming to die. This was garden-variety flu. Or hanta virus. Norovirus. If she was lucky, maybe Ebola.

In her fever-chilled dreams, a distant siren howled like a hungry baby. The mwah-MWAH-mwah-MWAH worked its way under the blankets and the longer she tried to ignore it, the louder it yowled.

She finally gave up on sleep and peered through a crack in the blind. She wasn't crazy. A red fire truck was rumbling up Healing House's snow-covered driveway.

She clawed the heaviest Pendleton blanket off the bed and wrapped it around her shoulders, Indian-style. By the time she crept down the hall, using the wall to steady her, firefighters in blue and neon-striped uniforms were boiling through the entryway.

All she could think in her addled state was that the arsonist was back. She couldn't smell a damn thing through her sinuses. Where was the smoke? The axes? The hoses? Why weren't they evacuating Healing House?

A dozen or so large men milled around the living room getting in the way of two firefighters who seemed to be trussing a boy on the carpet. They were packing him like a sausage in white, waxy paper like the stuff used at the meat locker.

A fireman herked and jerked a white sack up and over a pair of splayed legs. Adidas- striped feet, black hipster-skinny legs, a Bard College sweatshirt that had seen better days, disappeared in under white. In the instant before a woman in a Kevlar vest cinched a knot over the head, Old Girl glimpsed a white angular face with a wispy van Dyke on its chin. Nobody she recognized. Old Girl had witnessed some weird stuff on the plaid couch that was always front and center in all kinds of peer group shit, but seeing the face of stranger disappear into a body bag had to be the weirdest.

Margaret was standing with her back to Old Girl in the arms of a firefighter next to the white sack. She kept stuttering. "I tried, I tried---I kept trying...." Her words came out in a rush---"buthisheartwouldn'trestart!" The bearded man kept pat-a-pat-patting Margaret's back. The man-sized red plaid shirt she wore had somehow rucked up, calling attention to Margaret's square and motherly ass.

"How long did you do compressions?" the fireman asked.

"Twenty? -- maybe twenty-five minutes?" Margaret honked into his white handkerchief. "I called in to dispatch, then rolled him onto the floor."

"He was on the couch when you found him?"

"Out cold when I came in from those fucking raccoons."

The front door was propped open to the snow-humped lawn. Cold air made the entry a refrigerator and Old Girl felt the fingers of chill reaching towards her.

She wasn't sure but maybe she moaned. Margaret's head jerked away from the firefighter's shoulder. "Oh, honey, you shouldn't be out of bed!"

She made for Old Girl, crying, "Don't come in here! You don't need to see this," as the white oblong shape rolled out the door on a gurney like some mystery that could never be explained.

Margaret's meat-packer arms went out and the next thing Old Girl knew---she, who never allowed herself to be manhandled, who always shied away from human contact---Old Girl found herself folded onto Margaret's bosom. With her nose pushed into the vee between Margaret's size Double-Ds, she smelled faintly of Tide and wet dog.

She listened to the steady lub-lub-lub of Margaret's heart, amplified by the great breasts pressed up against Old Girl's ears like two flesh-and-blood conchs. Instead of feeling smothered, as she expected, she was shocked at how safe she felt. Margaret's body heat seemed to fuel a crack in the frozen lake of Old Girl's heart.

What could she do? Old Girl leaned into Margaret's pillowy heat, away from the cold air blasting in from the Idaho winter, and she let Margaret pat her back with warm, chapped hands.

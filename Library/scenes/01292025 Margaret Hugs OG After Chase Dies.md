01292025 Margaret Hugs OG Post Chase Death

They\'re in the entry hall in front of the sunken living room. The EMTs are just pronouncing time of death and they're stuffing him in a body bag to to take him to the morgue.

Margaret was totally whacked out. She was disbelief from the boy's death when he was just fine a few minutes ago and she was getting the glimmer of regret that she should\'ve translated his dee- in-the-headlights look and his blown out pupils and jerky movements as something more than jitters. If she\'d put her hands on his wrist and taken his pulse, she knew it would\'ve been racing and skipping on its way to exploding a vein.

A sudden sick feeling of regret flooded her. Why hadn\'t she taken the kid's pulse when he came out of the bathroom with that glazed look and sped up jerky movements? Hell, if she just put her hand over his heart, she would\'ve felt it pulsing and skipping like an engine about to blow.

A boy -- a child really, only 18 or 19 at the start of his life -- had died on her watch. Why had those fucking raccoon seemed so important when it was only garbage they were strewing on a newly plowed driveway...! Holy fucking guacamole! On newly plowed driveway that needed to be clean for the fucking Certification Rview Board visit that was supposed to start --- she glanced at her watch face --- in 17 minutes!

The thought of Dr. Hazey and his first sight of the day-glow, orange and pink neon patches that littered the snow between the coffee grounds and the slimy lettuce and the tomato coup stains froze her own veins. She'd picked up all the solid stuff she could before she came in to deal with Chase, but she hadn\'t had time to shovel snow over the rest of the mess.

\"Oh, honey, we need to get you back to bed. The Certification Board is due in 15 minutes.\"

OG lifted her head from crook of Margaret\'s neck. Sucked in a shuddery breath. They both stepped aside to let the gurney with the body bag pass by. The door opened letting in a deep freeze of cold that would accompany the boy's body into never-ending night.

Margaret\'s eyes were on the body bag but OG's focused w beyond her. \"Dr. Hayes just pulled up,\" OG said \"the ambulance is blocking his parking space.\"

\"Oh my God. That fucker is never early!\"

\"He is today. And the fire truck is blocking his way.\"

Honey, I\'ve gotta work a miracle here. Can you make it back to your room in one piece?\"

OG not it. Touched her hand to Margaret\'s and squeezed it with fever-hot fingers. \"Thanks. I needed that.\"

Margaret had no idea what OG was thanking her for. Her brain was filled with dread at the haunted look on Hayes\'s face when he met the body bag on its way out of healing house.

\"No, Margaret, you don\'t understand. I haven\'t let anybody hug me for years.,\" OG said.

The girl walked away, putting her hand on the wall to keep herself upright, and Margaret muttered to herself, might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb italicize that. \"Wait up honey. Let me tuck you into bed. Dr. Hayes would have to explain the body bag to himself.

Margaret\'s lifesaving that day didn\'t work for Chase. The drug out boy was too far out over his skis hurtling toward death with the cocaine load on his heart. But Margaret, a mother who was thinking about Chase\'s mother, took the time needed to mother OG when she was sick and vulnerable.

The story was from Chase\'s point of view into Margaret\'s point of view while she fails to save him, but inadvertently saves OG with her mother\'s love and comfort which sneaks in under OG\'s radar when she\'s at her most vulnerable and needful sick with fever and sore throat.

Meaning of story.

I should write an essay called Figuring Out What You Want to Say While You're Saying it. 3It\'s the dilemma of every Writer. The trick is to get to the point after what feels like an eternity of groping where the writer finally understands what the novel is truly about. My novel is not a novel about deciding to die; it\'s a novel about deciding to live after the thing that happens that makes you want to lie down in the road and refuse to get up.

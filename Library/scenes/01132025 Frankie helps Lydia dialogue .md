01132025 Frankie helps Lydia dialogue

"She's already hurt and shook up. Haven't you had enough?"

Jed just repeats his grievance with a stony expression. "She fucked me over." Why was his name Jed when he had the mental capacity of lead?

Frankie poked at Lydia's hair at the part that was stuck to her ear which she was having trouble hearing out of. Something black and stick was leaking down her neck into her shirt. "You got your jollies, ease up."

"Oh, piss and moan. I just clocked her a few times. She's a whiner."

Frankie's hand comes away from her hair red with blood. She hears something that sounds like a buzzing but it feels like he's blowing in her ear and because his breath is warm, it feels good. Lydia has no idea he's talking because she can't hear when her other ear is pressed into the ground.

"You musta busted her ear drum. She can't hear worth shit. What do you think she's going to do when she gets back to town, numnutz? She's going to turn you in the minute a doctor takes a look at her."

The upshot of their argument is that Jed hands Frankie the bowie knife "for safe keeping" but he is stone faced and obdurate as granite at the idea of making her walk back to the highway.

"She can't ride with us. She'll bleed all over the leather. No way am I going to fuck up the Raptor."

Frankie tells Jed is going to buy the farm if she makes it back to town and calls the Sheriff.

Jed says he's getting cold. F and finally agrees to let her walk it off and he'll call it even.

"Right, Lydia? You fuck me up, I fuck you up and we're good?"

Lydia will say anything to avoid having her face carved up and the way Jed talks about the walk to the highway, it seems like he's talking about a few blocks instead of 3 miles on a cold winter night.

"Roll her up in the moving blanket and stick her in the foot well and we'll all make it back to the highway like one happy family."

Lydia punctuates Jed's statement by listing over like the one member of the family who's had too much.

"Jesus Christ," Frankie says. "She can't even stand up. How the hell is she going to walk?"

Jed is already stalking around the truck to the driver's side with the shot gun tucked under his arm. The stock of the rifle rises to his shoulder and points at Frankie's chest putting an end to the argument.

"Get in," he says, "or you'll be walking too"'

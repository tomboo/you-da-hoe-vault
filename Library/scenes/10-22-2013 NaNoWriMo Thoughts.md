NaNoWriMo Thoughts

Now that Carla is gone the creative urge is upon me. This year that started with Bob\'s death on January 13 was book ended with Carla\'s death on October 20.

I felt like I was escaping into that time of life when we are making our choices for love and children. I became for the first time in 60 years a consumer of romance novels. For years, I\'ve been a literary snob always reading the Booker short list or the classics for entertainment and delight. I need to count up how many romances I read in 2013 \-- probably 500, as many as a seasoned romance editor at a publishing house. I\'d finish one and immediately search Amazon for my next \-- sometimes downloading a sample, often not \-- until I figured out that getting these books by library downloads was easier on the pocketbook.

So maybe one of my characters \-- another woman \-- is an inveterate romance reader. She loves her husband but uses romance to lift her from her humdrum cleaning tasks and sorrows.

I want to do NaNoWriMo this year. It feels like the Idaho story setting and the writing I\'ve already done could be the basis of a new novel, but I don\'t have a story arc yet. I have the beginning \-- Old Girl\'s suicide attempt on the road and maybe the ending could be the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ who leaves dead bird presents barreling down the road toward her. Could a deer or a moose come out of the woods, maybe a coyote who is coming to investigate and the madman catches the feral eyes in his headlights and swerves on the ice and misses the animal but crashes head on into a tree? Old Girl who\'s been lying down awaiting the oncoming crash scrambles to her feet to investigate and she holds the man\'s hand as he dies and that\'s the event that catapults her on to the future to live instead of trying to escape this mortal coil.

I need a time frame. Maybe a 24-hour period or a few days, something short \_\_\_\_\_ kind of events collide. Maybe a week in the life of the new girl. If it\'s the first week she\'s meeting everyone and observing the interactions. I want to keep her Kate Atkinson interior monologue style with close 3^rd^ person/POV and access to everyone\'s thoughts.

Who is the villain. He\'s a garbage man, someone who lives on the margins, visits the treatment house every week and leaves his weird little presents. He has a claw thing, a long-handled gripper that he can stick into a room to pick things or drop things so he doesn\'t enter so much as he touches with the claw handle and takes underwear balled up on the floor.

What am I writing a story about. Originally when Martha died and I worked on this story in Oregon, I was writing a story about a group of kids in a treatment facility who were struggling like mad to forge a life in the midst of loss and mental illness and trauma. Everyone in the program is damaged and some of them make it and some of them don\'t.

\"Am I dying?\" the man said.

Old Girl held his hand with both her hands feeling the stuttering pulse with her fingers on the inside of his wrist. The steering column of the old truck was embedded in his chest and a dark flow of back dripped to the floorboards. She could smell the penny smell of blood and watched its pulse in the moonlight like a living thing.

\"Not right this minute,\" she said.

\"Don\'t leave me,\" he said and to her amazement, he squeezed her hand. She squeezed back \-- the old automatic three squeezes her mom had taught her that said, \"I love you.\" You were supposed to respond with four squeezes \-- I love you back \-- but of course he didn\'t know that. He simply tightened his grip and she stayed bent over him, holding his hand until his grip loosened after what seemed like hours. She was still gripping his hand \_\_\_\_\_\_ the time she saw the lights of a milk delivery truck chugging towards them from town.

A giant reversal from beginning to end \-- story starts with Old Girl trying to kill herself; it ends with the death of the crazy garbage man and Old Girl choosing to live.

What happens in the middle? James and the epileptic girl fall in love, the Mormon homeless boy strikes up a friendship with the nympho bulimic, Marjorie the housekeeper eventually replaces the shitty cook, Ray her husband doesn\'t find a job, the crazy doctor with the fucked up relationship with his wife decides to take a vacation in Hawaii, and life goes on.

Does Old Girl light out for the territories by hitching a ride on the milk truck?

Yippee. It is amazing to me that when I put pen to paper a story pours out. The adage, \"Writing begets writing\" writ large. I feel creative in the face of death \-- maybe that\'s the theme of the burgeoning story.

Evan the madman is a tinkerer. He grabs stuff out of the trash \-- he works alone sort of a gyppo version of a \_\_\_\_\_ man servicing the rural community \-- and he builds stuff like the claw out of a light-weight piece of piping and welds the hard pincer claw onto its tip and puts a soft grip on one end so he can hold it and control its grip.

A tear in the fabric.

TEN

RACHEL HEARD THE BOOMING BEFORE she saw it. A tinkling sound like breaking glass. Thrashing and crashing, accompanied by breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl raced ahead of her down the blue-shadowed trail that descended to a lake, followed by James who put on speed like a sprinter. A thunderous crack. Then came an odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Rachel had ever heard.

By the time she got to the lake, the moose was already tiring. Rachel could see cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged dark pool a hundred yards from the lakeshore. A moose floundered in roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. The moose would lunge part way up, heaving its massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break off with its weight. Every time it managed to get up, another ledge of ice would shear off. The black water was dotted with snow clumps that shuddered and bobbed while the creature fell back again and started swimming in circles.

"Holy shit!" James' voice was awestruck.

"What can we do?" Old Girl's usually deadpan voice broke high and squeaky. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight of the struggling moose, she registered the fracture of Old Girl's careful facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind as the moose made another attempt to throw itself forward. It had huge antlers and rolling eyes that started in terror as it fell backwards.

"Get a stick!" Old Girl clawed at a clump of downed alder trapped in the ice at the shore. She got both hands on a branch and started jumping on it to try to break it out of the ice.

"What good is that? What's it going to hold on with?" James cried.

"Maybe we can get a branch under it. Lever it up somehow." Old Girl beckoned to Rachel and Rachel started jumping with her until the branch splintered and broke.

Rachel and Old Girl were holding the ice-laden branch in their bare hands when the elk made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back into heaving water chocked with floating ice. As they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its shoulders and withers sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of its antlers lit by a thin ray of sun. A crown floated as if suspended by unseen strings above the blue-black water. When the antlers slipped soundlessly under, the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the snow-clotted hole.

My God, Rachel thought. Oh my God.

By the time the rest of the group joined them on the shoreline, the water had stopped spinning and the ice blocks barely shivered. Josh pointed to the jagged hole in the ice and said, "Looks like something fell through. Got any guesses what?"

Rachel opened her mouth to tell them about the moose but Old Girl instantly stepped sideways, and nearly knocked her off her snowshoes. What the\--?

James was busy inspecting a clump of withered aspen saplings as if they had some kind of blight.

"Jesus, watch where you're going." Rachel yanked her snowshoe out from under Old Girl's netting and kept her mouth shut, as Old Girl intended.

Reza said a grizzly fell in. "Look. You can see its claw marks."

James said, "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else saw the cloven tracks and thought a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, Godzilla and Dr. Hazey, the head of Inner Horizons. "He forgot to look where he was going," said Danny.

A gust of wind and a drift of snowflakes ended the nature lesson. Josh said they had to turn back to the trailhead before the snow got serious.

When James turned away from the shoreline and took up a position right behind her on the trail, as if he wanted to watch over her, Rachel's heart gave a tiny lurch. She remembered James squeezing her hand during her seizure. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Or was there a God and the black pants she always wore like a uniform had saved her like she hoped?

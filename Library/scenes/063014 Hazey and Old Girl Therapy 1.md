063014 Hazey and Old Girl Therapy 1

> Old girl enjoyed being willfully painfully infuriatingly mule-headedly obtuse.

He\'d let her lay out a long rope of judgments against the idiots in the program and make snarky comments about the psychobabble of the therapists like Drew, the new age, born-again hippie-turned-prophet, and he'd laugh at her apparently endless supply of variations on the inner Journeys name: Inner Jerkings, Inmate Jury Duty, Inside Jokers, Interior Jerkoffs, In-And-Out Burgers, and once, when a therapist got caught bonking a Young Adult, Inner Mergers).

It was rare for Dr. Hazey to call her on her bullshit. He'd let her spout on about her opinions and her judgments and be a general wise ass and a pain in the ass and he would just look at her with those hangdog eyes and say, \"How\'d you get to be so old at such a young age?\"

\"How can someone so smart be such an idiot?\" was her interpretation of his sad-sack smile.

\"How\'d I get to be so lucky to have you as my therapist?\" Old Girl asked Dr. Hazey one day in session. \"You don\'t work with anybody else. Why me?\"

> \"You\'re so easy,\" Dr. Hazey told her.  \"Like taking candy from a baby.\"\
> \"Where\'s the candy?\" She said. \"Last time I asked for Skittles, you said, \'Forget it.\'\"

He opened the top drawer of his desk and handed her a box of orange TicTac\'s. "Don\'t say I never gave you anything.\"

She looked at the orange lozenge-shaped breath mints, popped one in her mouth and said, \"If these were cyanide, how long would it take me to croak?\"

> \"Arsenic would be less painful. You wouldn\'t even notice it sneaking up on you.\"\
> \" Where do they sell it?\"

His hands steepled in front of his face like a church. "You think I\'m going to answer that?\"

> \"One can always hope,\" she sighed. \"What time is it?\"\
> \"Time to live in the moment.\"
>
> "You're a live wire today. What's got into you?"
>
> "Just jerking your chain," he said.

She rolled her eyes and got up from the couch.  \"I can see why you don\'t treat many patients,\" she said. \"You\'re not very good at this.\"

> \"You\'re still alive, aren\'t you?\" Dr. Hayes said with a hint of tartness.\
>  \"Today I am,\" she said.
>
> \"See you tomorrow,\" he said.

She couldn\'t see any rhyme or reason to their \" therapy\" sessions. He let her natter on, make jokes, fool around with a deck of cards, or just lay on the couch and close her eyes. She actually enjoyed the quiet time in Hazey\'s office; it was the stillest, most relaxing space in Healing House where the sound of his breathing warmed the paneled room and the ancient grandfather clock ticked a little fast like a bird\'s heart.

\"What happens if you stop winding the clock?\" she asked one day. It was the only thing she said during the full 50 minutes session.

She had her eyes closed and she wondered if Dr. Hazey had been napping while she mapped the insides of her eyelids. Her red corpuscles traveled an interior landscape she couldn\'t follow.

After a pause, he cleared his throat and said,  \"It\'ll stop if there isn\'t somebody to keep it going.\"

> \"Like me?\"\
> \"What do you think?\"

She gathered her backpack, then leaned down and gave the winding key at the clock\'s base a quarter turn on the way out, by way of an answer. A laugh came to her as she shit the door. The sound of dry leaves stirring in the wind.

One day when she been making random comments, Hazey said, "Now we\'re making progress.\"

She gave him an incredulous look and he rolled his eyes right back at her.\
Who was crazier around here? The inmates? Or the people in charge?

> \"That\'ll be the \$125,\" she said. \"Hand it over.\"\
> \"My billing rate is \$225 an hour,\" Hazey said. \"Don\'t you think I\'m worth it?\"\
> \"Your just stole \$225 from my college fund. That\'s unconscionable!\"

\"Look at that! Now you\'re talking about going to college like a normal 17-year-old. I told you that you're making progress, even if it doesn\'t feel like it.

It was weird. Totally freaky and crazoid. She did feel marginally better sometimes when she walked out of Dr. Hazey's office, even if all they said to each other was \"hi,\" and \"see you tomorrow.\"

Was it the quiet? The sound of his slightly stertorous breathing somewhere behind her and off to her left, when she laid flat on the couch, calmed her. Maybe it was just the feeling that she could talk if she wanted to, even if nine times out of 10, all she wanted to do was lie there like a corpse.

Once Hazey told her she was so old, she had interior wrinkles. It made no sense at the time but sometimes, when she lay down on his couch, and let her mind wandered during their session, his comments would hover on the edge of her consciousness and seem to almost makes sense.

Maybe that\'s all therapy was. A warm body near you breathing in and out. The feeling of being listened to in a quiet space that was yours and yours alone, even if you didn\'t feel like talking. She walked out and felt almost hopeful that day which was totally ridiculous. \$225?! Get me out of here!

HAZEY POV

Hazey knew enough to keep quiet and let Old Girl\'s quick mind make connections without much more than a nudge. He understood her death wish more than he let on. Didn\'t he experience it every time he attended his weekly staff meeting with 14 highly intellectual, over-educated therapists who argued and whined like children? If he could\'ve put old girl on staff without getting arrested for child labor violations, he would have. The little shit was smarter than anybody he had on salary. She didn\'t say much. But everything she said counted. She was one of the few reasons he was able to maintain his sanity. Maybe he should discount her bill.

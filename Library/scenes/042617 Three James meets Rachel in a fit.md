042617 Three James meets Rachel in a fit

Three

ONE OF THE STUPID FAMILY STORIES Dad loved to tell was the day he had to leave a company board meeting because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to preschool like a house afire and Jamesy and the Schwarzenegger kid are eating PB&Js and drinking grape juice," Dad liked to say. "There's the Schwarzenegger with his arm around James, drinking out of the same glass. That night, Maria Shriver calls up and says James left a perfect bite mark on the kid's butt. So I tell James to bite his tongue next time. Or at least wait till after the board meeting."

As if James could control his urge to act which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. No advance planning involved. The impulse came. He bit down.

It was only later, like the moment he stared at the crazy pattern in the safety glass of a shattered windshield, that he realized it wasn't as fun as it looked.

"What the shit?" he cried, when the new girl whose name he'd forgotten, landed in his lap during Process. Her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at the black girl's attractive face upside down. Her pupils rolled up lin her head ike a window shade; the whites were mapped with tiny red capillaries he couldn't follow.

Half sprawled on James, half on the carpet, the girl flopped violently like a carp. Everybody in Process perched on the edge of their seats and watched the show as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between thankfulness that the seizure put an end to the accountability bull shit and truly appalled at the sight of Old Girl practically kneeling on the new girl's elbows while Darlene grappled her by the jaw.

James laid hands on her thin, long legs and he felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if she were being electrocuted. Her heels beat against the floor while James held on with all of his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying-on of hands on a person seized by electricity\-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. This girl's body had a will and an agenda all its own. He glanced over one shoulder at Lydia and tried to catch her eye, wondering if the bodily highjacking shook her as much as it shook him. Lydia was plucking at a cuticle and didn\'t look up.

The fit seemed to go on forever, until a bone-jarring shiver started at the girl\'s head and rolled through her body the way a dog shook off water. Hazel eyes -- a bruise-darkened green -- popped open. The girl glanced around the circle of faces and James had the impression she was thinking she'd woken up in hell. Consciousness spread slowly, followed by a deep blush of shame. The monster is out of the closet, and it is me.

"Are you OK?" Darlene was asking. James squeezed one hand, feeling fingers thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then caught his eye and let go as if she'd been burned.

By the time Darlene and Bruce and Margaret got her loaded into the van, Process Group was officially toast.

They spent the rest of the time replayingthe moment when the new girl lost it. Lydia said the girl fell in James' lap because she wanted to give James a blowjob. "I thought I'd have to fight her off."

Reza, his annoying motor-mouth roommate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants.

"Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

Old Girl was pissed. "They must have known Rachel was epileptic!" she cried. "What the fuck's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than let her rip him a new asshole with her razor tongue. The girl was pretty scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. She had an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he had grown familiar with at the bottom of a tequila bottle. "Careful of what?\" he asked. \"Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

Paul, the silent Aspbergery wizard, spoke in a rusty voice. "She looked like the Exorcist."

You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like he was a ghost.

"What are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

People laughed and Paul went back to doodling equations on the back of his hand.

Lydia bumped James from behind, the sign she wanted to have sex. How could you think about sex when you were shaken to the core?

Like Lydia, Dad, CEO of Life Monitor, a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, and a neurosurgeon, were both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, had reminded him in the session before Process. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked him. James's answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

Last week on their weekly Family Call, James's Mom asked him why he did the shit he did. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time," was the only answer that made any sense to him.

When he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on weed or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka \-- it didn\'t seem to James that he had trouble staying on task or that he was easily distracted. He did great at basketball and track.

Once, in a good moment with Dr. Mom, he asked her why he and Susan, his sister, were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system figures out how to talk to your frontal cortex."

He'd looked up the limbic system. As he understood it, the lizard brain housed all his fears and fuck-ups. The frontal cortex controlled the decision-making parts of his brain. Maybe his was the size of a walnut.

He said as much the day they were eating pizza on the way to his basketball game and Dr. Mom said, " Oh, no, James. That's not the problem. Your cortex is the right size. I could show you on an MRI. It just doesn't talk to the rest of your brain yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections. "Time," she said in her matter-of-fact way. "Only time makes the brain connect." She sighed. "And good genes."

Maybe that's why Susan did so well. She had the high round Olson forehead. All those genes and connections she inherited had programmed her to get straight A's in AP classes when he barely made it into Cal State despite a basketball scholarship.

Plain freckled Susan did exactly what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by every text or IM from his pals. Lydia's demand that he meet her for stand-up sex in the bathroom even though he was beginning to hate the sight of her, was no different. Susan would have said, "I have to study for my Calc test," while James\' Pavlovian response was always, "F3A3."

Fuck yeah, anytime, anywhere, any place.

Today, with Lydia? Not so much.

You-Da-Hoe

By Cynthia Hartwig

Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy with only the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

While ten people in their late teens and early twenties straggled into the living room of Healing House--- the "Young Adults" locked up with Old Girl at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment center in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho --- she moved an ottoman away from the irregular circle of beat-up couches set up for Process Group. Next to her on the wall, about 30 black-and-white portraits of old-time people looked down with grim stares. Old Girl suspected that people who had to sweep the streets with hand made brooms or carry hundreds of pounds of bricks on their shoulders would not have much sympathy for the whining and rationalizing and griping and blaming and circle-jerking called "processing" at Inner Horizons.

She contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear. It had started forming on the eaves of Healing House weeks ago. Now it was the largest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

A curtain of snow so thick, it cut off any hint of the giant blue-black fir trees that ringed the yard, was like an impenetrable wall. The sun hung out there somewhere but it was too weak to beat through the gloom with anything more than sulfurous yellow light.

Darlene, the Head Therapist, called Process Group to order by introducing the newest member of Inner Horizons like a cheerleader -- "Rachel Interlachen! Yay!"

The day before, Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two Christ-spouting guards in matching ski jackets. That meant Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to have somebody else take their flipped-out, fighting mad or sobbing daughter on a plane ride out of their hair. Rachel was a tall, hollow-faced girl who looked about 15, though she had to be at least 18 to be in the Program. She wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." Her wrists showed horizontal cut marks --- not vertical. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like most of the girls in the program. Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a skinny cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up in rural Idaho, everybody called the place You-Da-Hoe? Get it? You -- Da -- Hoe, for doing whatever fucked up shit that landed you in the middle of the wilderness with people even more fucked up than you.

When she was twelve, Old Girl had tried the easy route to oblivion. She raided the medicine cabinet at her guardians' house in Naperville, Illinois. But Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Among every multivitamin and mineral in the alphabet and jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed caplets and fish oil, Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was a crap way to go?

Now 17, two years into the Program, Old Girl applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to off herself. Nothing gross, for example, like the Ex-Lax fiasco. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor who thought she'd been pushed beyond the ropes---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water vomited so hard that a blood vessel burst in one eye ---all bodily fluids were verboten. Double-ditto road rash, like the kind she'd suffered when she'd fallen out of David's Buick when he motored around a corner on the way home from picking her up at middle school. She'd let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door and learned a good lesson in physics (or was it calculus?) about objects in motion. The car had to be going at least thirty-five miles an hour or it wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken arm and the experience of having gravel hand-picked out of her right side with tweezers.

Hanging was definitely off the approved list. She'd had to leave Girl Scouts before knot tying, when Mom and Dad and Gabe were killed in a car crash, so she'd never learned anything more complicated than a slipknot. But her main objection to asphyxiation was something she'd read somewhere about how your tongue swelled up three times its normal size and then hung out of your mouth like an eel. Nope. None of that.

When Old Girl "graduated" from Adolescents to Young Adults right after New Year's, they'd moved her out of Calm Cottage \--don't even get her started on the stupid names---which was in downtown Coeur D'Alene. Healing House was 15 miles from nowhere out in the woods. She couldn't see any improvement in the level of maturity in Young Adults unless she counted the leap in psychobabble. The morons sprawled out like a flock of chattering crows in the off-kilter circle of overstuffed and worn couches could spout like paid professionals on about accountability and self-actualization and personal validation, though now they were fighting like hyenas about whose turn it was to go first.

Cold pressed in on Old Girl through the glass. The wall thermometer on the outside of Healing House read 28 degrees. An hour ago, it was 25 degrees. Yippee!

At breakfast, she'd heard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door at the guy who did fix-it chores and picked up the trash whenever he felt like it. Margaret told him to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery. How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The volume of Margaret's voice made it seem like it was imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd hollered. Like that should mean something to the filthy man who drove his rackety truck like a maniac. Maybe melting was the key. She'd noticed the icicle dripping during the day, then refreezing during the night, so she assumed it was the cycle of melt and freeze that thickened the thing into a weapon in the first place.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her actual attempts---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her hair fan out like a sun storm around the corona of her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process that formed dreads had squeezed the copper out of her hair and now it was dull as cardboard. Death would pale the freckles so she allowed herself a slightly smaller nose.

Usually she covered her weirdly proportioned body with baggy jeans or dark shapeless sweats to hide her big boobs and freakishly long legs. What to do with the man's Fedora hat that looked tight but wasn't very practical when it was freezing? She could carry the Fedora in her backpack and pull off the black, pilling ski hat she wore with the earflaps pulled low.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job.

Old Girl would have to call in Margaret anyway to wield the scissors. Anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits. Too fucking many cutters.

Lydia Bronfman, who had to read her Accountability Letter first, was a cutter. Lydia was also a nympho and bulimic and from some famous beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear it in her nasal singsong as she droned through an apology letter for fucking Axel Friedman, her therapist. People liked Axel but Lydia's fuck fiesta had gotten him fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would they let go of Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why Lydia was apologizing to Process Group in the first place. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall since she fucked everybody. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat alone in the corner, could count that high.

Lydia detailed a long list of behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing in a breathy voice. She was channeling Marilyn Monroe and pretty soon, everybody was laughing. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she said, enjoying her moment in front of an audience. "He said no, that wasn't appropriate touching but that's not what his woody was saying."

Darlene rapped her pen on her clipboard. "We don't want to hear all the gory details. We want to hear what you're taking ownership of."

Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by sapphire earrings the size of quarters. "How can I take ownership of what I did if I don't describe it?"

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? In a good way..."

Sometimes, Old Girl had a hard time drifting off to sleep because her mind would be too busy fabricating scenes of her death. She liked them thickly plotted as operettas. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Vera Wang dresses. Nothing Jessica McClintock sluts-ville for Old Girl. Lavender played a primary role.

Her own actions were secretive and smart with just the right amount of clues to foreshadow her plans. Weather and setting, depending on her mood, varied between dark and creep-meister or lit like film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she would imagine a fishing boat that sailed on oblivious to a body falling out of the sky. Tragedy didn't have to slap you in the face.

She wondered how much warmer it had to get to make the icicle scene work. If she watched the temperature during Process Group three times a week and checked it before dinner every day, she'd get a read on the melting and refreezing progress. The problem with real life was that there was so little you could control.

She'd learned the hard way to apply the strict rules of realism to her death. No pianos dropping out of the sky. No earthquakes parting the earth in front of her. She herself had to be the agent of her demise. That's why death-by-icicle wasn't ideal. She'd have to pick the exact right moment to stand under it. It occurred to her that if she ran a garden hose over the eaves, maybe the water would loosen the dagger at its moorings. When gravity knocked her brains out, people would think she'd only been trying to be helpful by removing the danger to others. Killed in the line of duty. That was a plot line she hadn't explored.

"Angela! Wake up!" An edge in Darlene's voice, cut into her concentration. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to set the table.

"Angela! Come back to the party!"

Old Girl shook her head. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally would *not* answer to the name she'd been given before her family vanished. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and an ache in her stomach from having it pumped, she renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, the alternate existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

Darlene tapped at the annoying clipboard. "Angela, we're waiting?"

"I don't know anybody named Angela."

"Excuuuuuuse me. Would Old Girl please join us?" Darlene put air quotes around "Old Girl."

Old Girl thought about the pleasures of double homicide-suicide. She turned her back on the icicle. Jesus. Watching an icicle grow. The Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. On the bright side, she added the number 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Lydia was saying something about how she'd coerced a police officer with a blowjob. Black curls bobbed over her pink cashmere sweater. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene tilted an eyebrow, and then flipped to a clean page on the clipboard. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist shake up. Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved to Young Adults. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized founder Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from the beginning. A Yale degree in psychiatry on Hazey's wall said he specialized in Adolescents, probably because he still was one, though the man was in his dotage. She'd seen the year 1986 on one of a dozen diplomas mounted on his office wall one day when she was too wound up to sit during session. That would mean Hazey had to be what... 46? No, 47. She didn't know why she'd tucked that worthless piece of information in the back of her mind like a magpie with a shiny bit of tin.

James Olson, the blonde, quiet surfer from Malibu, California, had taken the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche when he was stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd admitted in one of those tense, shame-fests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get up. "I traded my Revos for the candy," he was saying.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high.

Darlene asked, "Who'd you trade with?"

"Somebody from NICC." Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, the meth-addict motor-mouth, supplied the candy because he was wearing a New York Jets cap with the Revos hanging off the back of it. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College where Young Adults in Transition were allowed to take 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with his trade. Within Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex. Ching-ching-ching and more Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, another drip of moisture beaded up and rolled to the edge of the eaves. It hung there as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions. Time thinned until Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

When the circle of accountable behaviors had looped through cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism --- if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it--- it finally came back around to Rachel. Darlene urged her to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Old Girl felt for the newbie who eyed the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's failures. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up, as if to address the group but instead, she toppled slowly backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

Margaret wished to hell they'd bring back corporal punishment. She'd start with whoever clogged the toilet in the Boys' Wing with a sock. Who would try to flush a crew *sock* down the toilet? Margaret didn't even want to think about what was in the sock. The crazy shit these kids thought up.

If they spent half their time devoting their intelligence to fixing their issues instead of acting out, they\'d turn out OK. That was Margaret's common sense opinion. But then, of course, Margaret wouldn\'t have her shitty low-paying job as Day Supervisor at Inner Horizons. Was this the most dysfunctional, worst run psychiatric treatment facility in the country? She'd overheard Darlene whining to some colleague on the office phone while Margaret was tapping away at the PC in the corner. She was filling out damage claims because one of the Anger Managements had punched a hole in the laundry room wall.

When she finished filling out the forms, Margaret went into the living room to dust. She thought the photos of people from the old country that took up an entire wall of the Healing House living area would be more interesting if they didn't require so much work. Whose idea were all those heavy gold frames with swirls and furbelows?

On the whole, though, she liked the people in the portraits. They seemed like an industrious lot.

Dusting took forever, then she switched to cleaning fingerprints off the anti-glare glass, all the while keeping one ear half-tuned to the two troublemakers snarking at each other on the couches. Danny, and Esty were waiting for the van to show up and drive them to their therapy appointments in town. A few minutes later, Lydia joined them. They hadn't been together in the same room for more than a few minutes before they sounded like a swarm of angry bees.

Esty had lost weight. She'd dropped sixty pounds, which is why Margaret had to stop by Target on her way to work to pick up something that would fit her. She was still size 2X and nobody had anything big enough to lend her\--not even Margaret whose size 16 pants pinched her in the gut. Too many donuts, gotta quit, she told herself, taking a quick bite of the maple bar she'd picked up at Starbucks.

Danny was involved in some kind of devilment against Esty, Margaret could tell. Esty sagged like a blob of misery taking up most of the plaid couch. Danny sprawled full length on the couch with the bloodstain. Lydia was reading a People magazine at the game table, ignoring them. Between a rock and a hard place. That Danny. She was the meanest girl Margaret had ever met and that was saying something if you were raised on the wrong side of the tracks in Yakima.

Esty hit a milestone in the weekly weigh-in: 285 pounds. Quite an achievement considering she'd entered the Program weighing 365. You'd think those skinny girls would pat Esty on the back for all her hard work. Hell, no. Danny asked Esty how she could stand to see herself in the mirror (Margaret wrote her up immediately). Margaret knew from the grapevine that they called her Cellulitis though she hadn\'t been able to catch them at it. It was like the poor girl\'s fat cells drove those skinny girls crazy.

Margaret spritzed at an image of a peasant woman with vinegar and water, her grandmother's recipe before Windex took over the world. She scrubbed hard at a hickey under the old woman's eye before she realized it was a wen. She looked crow-like in a black dress, black shawl, and a black babushka scarf tied under her chin with both hands folded over a stomach as round as a bowling ball. The hands were chapped and cracked like they'd been dipped in lye. It occurred to Margaret that they probably had been dipped in lye. This woman of all people would appreciate Margret's mother's vinegar solution---gentle! Doesn't take your hide off! ---and not for the first time, Margaret wondered how these people on the wall were related to Dr. Hazey, her crazy, and criminally lazy boss.

It was probably Dr. August Hazey's idea to frame all those photos in dust-sucking frames, she thought darkly.

Manual laborers and soldiers mixed with a pastry chef with a copper bowl as big as he was ---a man who enjoyed the fruits of their labors! --- along with a street sweeper in patched clothes. A bricklayer emerged from a hole in the ground as if from hell.

At least someone saw them. The people weren't invisible to whoever captured them on film, not like she felt herself invisible around the great Dr. Hazey who either barred his office door or floated around in a "haze" of airy and vacant distraction.

Did the workers in the photos wait politely while the photographer fussed with the big box? Maybe they were glad for the rest break in their routine. Or maybe they were just thankful someone noticed what they were doing and thought enough of their labors to record it.

If a photographer wandered through Healing House, Margaret imagined showing herself cleaning toilets or unplugging the one clogged by whoever kept jerking off in his sock. She made a mental note to check all the boys' sock drawers and have a private word with Mr. One Sock Toilet Clogger about the limitations of modern plumbing.

Margaret would ask the photographer if she could be memorialized with an upraised toilet plunger in her right hand like the Statue of Liberty. All the socks she'd rescued would be arrayed around her head like a star. She'd call it *Champion of the Poor Man's Condom*, which she thought was just as good a title as the photo in Hazey's office called *Three Farmers On the Way to a Dance*.

Before Hazey's wife, Alma, left him last year with her horse whisperer (he must have been good at whispering in Alma's ear) Alma told Margaret that the old time photos looked like a "Wanted" gallery. Margaret didn't think the bricklayers and chefs and street sweepers and soldiers and policemen looked criminal. Just criminally overworked.

She balled up another newspaper to rub the streaks off a grim farmer surrounded by grim and dour-faced women; even the children in matching blond braids stared back at her with hard faces. If they were Hazey's relatives, he'd inherited their lack of humor but somehow managed to escape their work ethic.

If Margaret had her say, which she didn't she'd\--. Oh Christ!

Margaret flung away her balled up newspaper, and she was in the middle of the catfight before she could finish her thought.

Danny was yanking Esty\'s hair and Esty---good for her! --- clawed at Danny\'s face with her fingernails. Except Esty's nails were chewed to the quick. Still, she managed to bloody Danny\'s nose\--she must have gotten off the first punch---though Danny was popping her on the ear with a closed fist. Margaret hauled Danny backwards, her arms around her middle, while the girl kicked and flailed. Darlene ran in and actually sat down on Esty. Margaret wasn\'t quick enough to stop Danny\'s boot from connecting with Esty\'s kidneys. Cheap shot, the little shit! Margaret shook the cursing, spitting girl. \"Stop it! Get control of yourself!\" she cried over Esty\'s outraged howls.

Margaret didn\'t have time to ask what started the fight because Big Paul, who'd joined the girls while she was cleaning, started throwing up on the rug. Margaret had just had the orange shag cleaned last week and now this big, usually silent savant was spraying chunks of barely digested egg and oatmeal all over it.

Before she let Danny escape, she made her scrub the worst chunks off the rug with Anti-Icky-Poo. \"Isn\'t this the stuff you use on dog shit?\" Lydia wanted to know. Poop. Blood. Vomit. It\'s all the same, Margaret told her.

By the time she and Darlene got everybody carted off to their therapy appointments, it was time to make her weekly Status Calls to the parents.

Margaret was supposed to call 20 parents once a week to report on the kids' \"progress in daily living.\" Margaret wished fervently she could tell someone how she herself was progressing in daily living.

Was that job at the Tasty Freeze still open?

It paid a dollar an hour less than Day Supervisor at Healing House (Heller House is what she called it when she told Hank, her husband, about her day. He was a Wal-Mart stocker but he'd hurt his back lifting something stupid so they really needed her paycheck. Jobs--at least ones that paid a living wage---weren't thick on the ground in Coeur D'Alene where cheap employers hired part-time so they didn't have to pay benefits.

Two years ago, when Dr. Hazey told her he'd pay her hourly, plus benefits (hallelujah!), she thought she'd won the PowerBall Lottery. Of course, she'd gone two years without a raise and Hazey hadn't mentioned the joy of finding a bag of vomit stashed in Danny's closet. If her roommate hadn't complained about the smell, the foul thing would still be there.

Later today she had a meeting with the plumber. Jesus.

Didn't these kids have any idea they'd have to pay a mortgage someday?

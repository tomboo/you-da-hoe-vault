Final Scene in *You-Da-Hoe*

1931 words

CONTEXT YOU NEED:

My novel is structured in a circle. It\'s first section takes the reader to the point where Old Girl drugs the night supervisor and runs away from the psychiatric treatment program in the middle of a freezing January night. On her walk toward town, she sees a car coming in the distance and decides to lie down in the road and let it run over her.

The middle of the novel goes back in time to the weeks prior to Old Girl\'s escape as she builds fragile but binding relationships with her roommate, Rachel, and Margaret, the Day Supervisor.

The end of the novel picks up the same scene from the opening section when Old Girl lies on a snowy rural road, expecting to die as the lights of a speeding car come toward her. The car, unbeknownst to Old Girl (but known to the reader) is driven by Rusty, the garbage man, who is on his way to kidnap Rachel and keep her locked up in a container he\'s set up at the dump.

Old Girl doesn\'t watch the vehicle hurtling toward her. She doesn't want to witness gravity and tons of metal speeding at her that will crush her into a bloody spot. Why look at ugliness? Mom used to say, It\'s a beautiful world. Why shouldn\'t Old Girl\'s last view of life on earth be of something beautiful?

That\'s why she\'s staring at the looming Ponderosa pines that line the winding snow-covered road. The road curves sharply before the dip in which she's lying on her back and she can see the anxious hop and flutter of the car's headlamps in the tops of the trees. The lights catch caramel-colored bark and hundred feet boles reaching for the stars and she\'s thinking about the smell of caramel mixed with vanilla when you peel the puzzle shaped pieces of bark off the tree. Why does it smell sweet? She\'s thinking, expecting oblivion to answer.

A terrific bang. Hailstorm of falling snow and ice. Bark, branches, wood splinters, chips pelt her in the face and neck like someone has hurled a shovel-full of sharp gravel at her.

Old Girl is on her feet and scrambling over a high berm of snow on the roadside before she even realizes she is moving. Her feet are numb and she\'s wobbly and uncoordinated, falling and slipping on the icy bank toward a heap of crumpled metal with still spinning wheels.

The engine rumbles and smokes. High beams light the treetops at a crazed angle. A big ancient truck has hit one of the tall pines head on and the front end is embedded in a trunk that has cracked and bent over backwards from the impact.

She clambers up the snow berm pushed far above her head by the snow plows and she manages to half-slip, half-slither down the back side of the berm to the passenger side door. All she can see inside is a dark hunched form leaning forward with arms protectively hugging the steering wheel.

No luck yanking the bent door open.

The glass on the windshield is crazed but still holding together. She crawls up on the crumpled hood and starts kicking at the broken glass using the blunt toes of her packs to break out the shards clinging to the rubber molding like jagged icicles.

"Are you hurt?" she calls through the hole she's enlarging with her feet but all she can hear is the breathy rumble of the still running engine. She smells gas. Some unidentifiable stink. It takes a lot of work to kick a hole in the glass big enough to get inside and she brushes at the glass shards with her gloves trying to clear an entrance. Finally she just backs into the jagged hole using her heels to kick aside the shards. A gymnastic eel turn and shimmy deposits her in the front seat that has become a weirdly narrow space between the dashboard and the rear of the cab. Litter covers everything. A tangle of ropes. Hamburger wrappers. Styrofoam cups. Orange peels A roll of duct tape.

It takes her a few seconds to understand why the space is so cramped. The engine, normally under the hood, has been driven forward into the cab. The man isn't hugging the steering wheel. He\'s leaning forward, his arms wrapped around the column that's embedded in his sternum.

\"Holy shit.\" She breathes in the wet penny smell of blood. To her astonishment, the driver opens his eyes and he turns his face towards her He\'s looking at her with the expression of someone who has something he doesn\'t and she has no idea what that might be.

\"Are you hurt?\" she says again. The absurdity of the question\--for Christ\'s sake, a steering column is sticking into his chest!---propels her into reaching for the ignition key and she turns the engine off but leaves the lights burning.

A dark, almost black stickiness wets her fingers. It\'s coming from the steering wheel. Engine fluid? Lubricant? The headlights still staring crazily at the treetops reflect enough light into the cab to reveal the pallor of the man\'s face. Black greasy hair frames a puzzled expression.

\"Who are you? he wants to know.

For the first time in all her years in treatment, Old Girl says, \"Angela. My name is Angela." The story of how she became Old Girl seems like a lifetime ago.

"Pretty," he says, his voice raspy and faint.

The man is maybe in his fifties. He's filthy. His hair is thin and stiff with grease. A gash on his temple drips red. He waves his hand vaguely at the steering column. \"It\'s stuck,\" he says. "I can't move.\"

It dawns on Old Girl then that the dark flow that is dripping quietly on the floor mat is coming from the man's chest cavity. "I should go and get help," she says. She wants desperately to scramble out of the truck, but he grasps her fingers like a lifeline. \"I\'m scared," he says. "Don't leave me," She's never seen an expression of such intense longing.

\"Don't close your eyes." Old Girl is thinking about something she read about not allowing a person with a concussion to fall asleep, a useless fact that\'s stuck like a lot of other useless information in her head. She tries not to count the black beads that are flowing down the steering column. The drips are falling like an irrigation hose on high.

\"I didn\'t do nothing," the man murmurs at one point. Later, he says, "It's not fair."

Old Girl nods, in complete agreement. Life isn\'t fair. She doesn't have a steering column sticking out of her chest, for example. She is the one who laid her body down in the middle of the dark road expecting death to find her and instead, it is circling this dirty, stinking man.

\"What are you going to do about it?" He says a little later with a philosophical shrug.

"It's OK." Old Girl squeezes his hand, then tries to count his thready pulse. Is it multiply by 6 for 10 seconds or is it count the beats for 10 seconds and divide by 6? She gives up because even an idiot can tell that his pulse is slowing like a clock that's winding down. She\'s watching the drops that drip from the column as they bead and hang for longer and longer moments before they hit the floor. \"Who knew that he hath so much blood in him,\" the line from Macbeth comes to her. Now she wishes she\'d paid more attention in school, especially in First Aid and Home Accident Prevention, the class she took to become a certified baby sitter. Now she\'s knows that even if she had paid attention in babysitting, the instructions wouldn't have covered a dying man holding her hand with a death grip. About the time it occurs to her it is a death grip, she perceives a relaxation of his fingers as if he\'s drifting off to sleep.

The last thing he says to her, after brushing restlessly at his chest, is, "Always rain. Never any goddamned sun."

The tick of the engine. A rasp, dry and dull as wheat chaff, exits from his lungs.

Something feels enormous. Ever after she will remember this moment in the presence of death. The only time that will come close to this feeling in her later life will be the birth of a baby that is so far from conception at this point it might as well be one of the stars scattered like diamond dust across the blue-black Idaho sky. Until this moment, she had been feeling like the man \-- grubby, filth-encrusted, smelling vaguely of hamburger grease and motor oil \-- is holding on to her as if to life itself. As his breathing changes from an even breathy rasp to deep inhalations with long silences between \-- she realizes she is the one gripping him.

If she had all the power in the world, she\'d keep him in the cab, among the burger wrappings and old styrofoam coffee cups, the ripped seat with the guts of it spilling out.

His eyelids are blue-veined. His color, when she got in the cab, was ruddy with life, and now his lips whiten and he\'s a dusky blue on the tip of his nose. The black stubble of his beard looks blacker in contrast to the pallor of his skin.

His jaw opens and closes like a fish without water over its gills. A light gust of wind riffles the papers on the dash. Goose bumps pass over his neck and upper chest as his face turns dusky gray, dim as salted snow. When a final rolling rattle like the call of crows in the act of mating comes from the back of his throat, Old Girl experiences a vast longing to turn back the hands of the clock.

Stay! she wants to tell him, even though she knows he\'s passed the point when  he can hear her. She'd covered up the steering column embedded in his chest with a moving blanket she found in the rat's nest behind the seats so that the horrible sight disappeared from her mind as effectively as if she physically removed the steel bar and glued him whole again by wishing.

\"Don\'t let me die,\" he\'d said, clutching for her hand, his fingernails torn and ragged, his wiry hair plastered to his scalp with dirt and grease. Why did he look so alive when every detail about him looked raw and hard fought, as if life had been a wrestling match for him every second of every day.

More! She wanted to cry as the fingers of cold seep into the truck in the minutes after he is gone.

It was easier to back out of the cab feet first, reversing her direction from the way she came in, as if she was squirming out of a birth canal. She kick-stepped a trail up the snow berm and plodded down to the road feeling new blood pulsing in her feet. Pain like ice crystals tumbled and tore into her veins.

The silver snow light seemed infinitely colder. A few snowflakes sifted down from the pine branches above.

A strange half human-half crab monster doll she found on the floor of the cab was nestled in her pack. It had a shaving brush for a head with large goggle eyes mounted to the handle but no mouth and a sharp unicorn-horn shell for a penis, mismatched doll parts for arms, and a bottom half, naked as a newborn, with claws instead of legs.

Her plan was to walk into town and thumb a ride to I-90, then hitch to Seattle, where she intended to ask Ruth, her dad's sister and Matt, her husband, to help her get on her feet.

She'd wanted to die for so long, it was hard to imagine a life directed at living. Instead of blowing her nose and wishing she could blow her brains out, she now had to think about reaching for a Kleenex. Life was complicated, even when all she was thinking about was getting rid of postnasal drip. Maybe the truck driver who picked her up would have a Kleenex box between the seats. Maybe she should just stop by a 7- Eleven and grab some napkins. A whole world of possibilities opened up when you were thinking about how to live life.

Meanwhile, Angela began the long trudge toward town, feeling life, painful and biting, reawaken in her frozen toes.

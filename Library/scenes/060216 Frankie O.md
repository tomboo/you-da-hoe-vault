060216 Frankie O

The little guy with Jed was skinny and feral looking with a rat-like face and serious, angry-red acne scars. Lydia thought maybe she'd seen him around campus. A drug dealer, possibly. His faint beard looking like he was trying to cover up the acne but doing a bad job of it.

Jed was drunk. Mean drunk, she realized by the tic in his jaw. A flat dangerous look in his little dark eyes. He was missing his precious Stetson. A flash of memory: Margaret knocking he cowboy hat off his head with her big purse and then stepping on it. Today he was wearing a John Deere cap with a permanent sweat band. When he took it off to scratch his head, she saw for the first time that his hairline was receding. No way was he a college student.

"Who're you?" she asked the nervous guy next to him.

"Frankie." He was worrying at a fingernail and the thigh next to hers jumped out of time with the motion of the truck.

"Frankie O." Jed strung out the O like it was some private joke. "Ain't that right, you piss ant."

Jed shifted down and the wheels spun, then caught against the plowed road. They had been moving slowly but steadily uphill after turning off I-90 at Post Falls and bypassing its unassuming houses and tiny yards. Outside of town there were clusters of houses, the occasional barn but once they turned into the mountains, all she could see beyond the cone of the headlights was black.

"Where are we going?" Even to her, her voice sounded tremulous.

"Peckerwoods got to party," Jed said. "Reach me another beer, Frankie. Make yourself useful." He chugged the last of the beer he had in his hand and lobbed it out the window.

Frankie O loped back toward her. She watched warily, expect him to hit her or knock her down, but instead, he shoved a pair of paint-spattered boots into her hands. "Put these on before you get frost bit."

She looked at the big boots stupid, feeling like she didn't know what to do with them. Her brain seemed slow and sluggish. Even her tongue was thick.

When she didn't move, Frankie knelt in front of her and steadied her while he shoved one numb foot into a boot and tied it twice around the ankle. "They're a little big." He sounded sheepish. "Give me the other foot." She leaned on his shoulder and while he tied that boot, he told her she had to keep walking. "No lying down!" he kept saying like a parrot. All she wanted to do was sleep so it was irritating to hear him tell her not to do the only thing she could think of that made sense.

Jed was yelling from the truck, "Peckerwood, piss ant, shit for brains..." by then and the last sight Lydia caught of them was a beer can glinting silver as it tumbled out of the cab toward the moon.

"They're Jed's work boots," he said. "Better than nothing." He jerked his chin at the snow balls collected on the underside of her socks that made it hard to walk. "Keep walking. You'll be OK."

"'K," she mumbled. Her jaw was messed up. Thank you came out 'hank 'oo.

It took forever to get the jacket on. She only got it partially zipped, then the zipper teeth stuck and she gave up. She should have put Frankie's boots on sitting down because her feet had no feeling and she fell twice before she plopped down on her bare ass and got the shoe strings knotted around her ankles. She was lucky Frankie was a small man. Her feet slopped in the leather but if she took a little skating step without lifting the shoe off the ground, they stayed on her feet.

Frankie had shaken his head when he saw her eye. "Man, he did a number on you," he said. "Guess I was lucky he didn't break my nose." At the concern in his eyes, she thought about his small boy's dick. How it had spurted in the moonlight in almost the same instant she touched him. His expression had been awestruck, then pained when Jed started hopping around like a raven, calling him a pussy and a queer.

She couldn't really hear that well. And there was something drastically wrong with her balance. She walked bent over and kept listing drunkenly as she made her way down an eternity of switch backs. Every few step she had to correct her aim so that she didn't walk off the down slope into thin air.

It felt after a while like she was living in some alternative existence that was somewhere between the living and the dead. The silver moon reflection off the snow lit up the ruts but after a time when there wasn't a sound in the world, she realized that maybe it wasn't just her eye that was fucked up. She had to turn her head to see out of her left eye. No wonder she kept wandering to the cliff's edge and then had to re-aim herself like a drunk.

She couldn't have said when she realized she wasn't alone. She didn't hear a sound. A prickling sensation started in the back of her neck when she rounded a bend. A moon the color of a gold coin oozed out from behind a cloud. Silhouetted in it shadow, a big dark cat lay on its haunches chewing something in the snow.

The cat's head jerked up. It stopped mid-chew, something long and blue-purple dripping from its mouth. A tawny yellow gaze. In profile, it's body was a dull tawny color and it looked as wide from muzzle to tail as a German Shepherd. But when it turned and padded a few steps closer, she realized that it was no more than a couple of hand spans wide. It could have stood between two marsh rushes and not disturbed either one.

Oh Holy Christ, she thought. Now, after being butt-fucked and beaten and raped, you feed me to a mountain lion?

The thought flitted through her consciousness but the cat ignored her and continued chewing and knowing at the pile of wet fur in front of it. She could have sworn she'd heard a baby cry in the stillness but she'd thought she was hallucinating. Had it been a ground squirrel or rabbit caught in the hunt?

By the tie she staggered into a lighted RV camp with a Vacancy sign, the cougar was an apparition. She could never decide if it had been real or she just needed to be alone that night.

The older woman who answered her knock cried out when she caught sight of her. "Oh, honey!" he said. "Who hurt you?"

Me, Lydia was thinking. I hurt myself. Then I saved myself.

"Alvin," the woman in a bowling shirt bellowed. She supported her across the warm lighted room and laid her down on an afghan covered couch, wrapping it around her bare legs as she shushed her. "Call the ambulance. This girl's near froze to death and somebody beat her to a pulp.

When she came around a bend in the road, she saw a big tawny-colored cat silhouetted in the moonlight on the empty road. It was gnawing at something furry, its head buried nose deep in a pile of entrails. Its fur was glistening and bloody up to its ears and its fangs dripped with blood that was dark as ink in the silver light. When it turned its head from where it had been gnawing, it looked like a parody of a kitten lying on its belly at its milk bowl. In profile, it looked about as wide as a German Shepherd. Straight on, when it turned towards her and padded a step closer, she saw that it was thinner than two hand spans. It if had been standing in a marsh between two reeds, it wouldn't have disturbed either one.

Oh Holy Mother of Christ, she thought. I get raped, butt fucked, beat up and now you give me to a fucking cougar?

The cougar regarded Lydia for a long minute. Wind moved the branches in the bushes behind it but she couldn't hear a thing, not even the sounds of its chewing. A few silver-tipped snow flakes floated past and then the cougar dipped its head and dragged the rabbit it was eating up and over the berm of the road and disappeared into the trees.

She couldn't say how long it took her to reach the RV court with the lighted red Vacancy sign on the office porch. A large gray-haired woman screamed when she answered Lydia's knock. "Oh, honey, what happened to you?"

The woman pulled her into her pillowy breasts and between bellows to someone named Alvin to call an ambulance and rubbing and chaffing at her arms and feet and wrapping her in a purple afghan, Lydia knew she had made it.

"Who did this?" Alberta and Alvin Fulsome, her husband, both asked her repeatedly while she sat on Alberta's big lap, head on her shoulder and wrapped to her nose in the afghan that she belatedly realized she was bleeding all over. Me, she kept wanting to say to them, but it seemed like too much effort. I'm responsible.

She closed her eyes, letting Alberta hum to her and wrap the afghan closer while Vern murmured on the phone to the Sheriff's department. Me. I hurt myself. I saved myself. It was all me.

062316 Lydia walks herself down

When Jed was finally too drunk or high to keep his mind on punishing her, they drove off, leaving her curled up on the stomped and trampled snow.

Frankie O had spent most of the time in the cab listening to country music while Jed worked her over. Jed called him a fag and a pervert when he wouldn't fuck her and then turned his attention to doing everything he could think of to hurt and humiliate her.

When he couldn't think of anything else to do to her, Jed staggered to the truck and told Frankie to drive.

"What about her," she heard Frankie ask.

"Let the bitch walk," he said.

Something was wrong with her balance. Jed had slapped and punched her in the head during --or was it between? --sex and when she lifted her head from where she was lying, something dark stained the snow and she had to keep wiping her eye to get rid whatever was dripping in it.

The GMC wheeled around on the flat spot where they'd parked. In her dull haze, the shout at first they were going to run over her and she waited dumbly like an animal to be put out of her misery. But instead, they just drove away about a hundred yards. It took her a minute to realize they were stopping.

The driver side door swung open and she heard Frankie O say he had to piss. He loped around the back of the truck and in a few seconds, she was amazed to find herself standing and swaying on her bare feet. There was no feeling in her legs. It was like standing on two wooden blocks with Frankie O had to hold her up stabilizing her with both hands. "Come on, now," he was saying. "Get moving. You got to walk."

He sat her on the bullet-shot refrigerator and went back to the back of the truck and scrabbled around under the tarp. When he came back, she had fallen over and was lying on her side naked from the waist down, curled up like a grub in the snow.

"Least he left you your socks," Frankie said. Smart Wool. The words flitted through her brain. For a dumb girl.

Frankie was working a battered work boot on one sock clad foot, but first, he had to pull off the balls of ice that had collected on her sole while Jed chased her around. He stuffed one block in first and wrapped the leather shoe strings around her ankle twice before he knotted it off. He pulled her back to standing and knelt before her---she leaned over him like a rag doll---and he did the same thing with the other boot. "All you gotta do is walk downhill," he said. "Its only a coupla miles. That's nothing."

Jed could be heard yelling querulously from the truck. "...fuck you doing? Taking a dump?"

"Keep walking," Frankie said. "Just keep moving and you'll be fine.:

He watched her sway and catch herself, then shrugged out of his jacket and put it around her shoulders. "Put this on," he said. "You won't freeze."

In a few moments, she was mercifully alone. The sound of the engine growled like an animal for a long time before it was lost in the darkness.

He yanked her to her feet and she leaned on him so he could stuff her feet into the boots one by one. "Don't lay down," he said. "Keep moving."

The growl of the truck engine faded like an animal moving off in the jungle. It felt good to be alone.

The flat spot where they'd had their fun was trampled and tromped. Red and blue spent shells stuck out of the snow with tattered orange target papers curling in a slight breeze. The beer cans they'd shot glinted like silver dollars in the snow light.

She felt dizzy and light headed, but surprisingly, except for her feet, she wasn't cold. Her back, where Jed had kicked her with his cowboy boots, emitted a fiery pain and all she wanted to do with lie in the snow to put it out.

It seemed important to do what Frankie said. She had a dim awareness that Frankie was the reason she'd made it through the night. So she took a few tottering steps and nearly walked out of one boot. She learned to make kind of slip-sliding steps without lifting her feet from the ground and she walked between the ruts of the truck tires to avoid falling.

It was beautiful in the dim silver-tinged light. A few snow flakes drifted silently like ash. The only sound, a faint soughing of wind and the far distant watery sound she finally figured out was the sound of car traffic coming from I-90.

Frankie hadn't participated in Jed's "partying." Jed had taunted and cursed at him for being a queer and a faggot. He'd interrupted him with a beer when Jed had her on the ground and was kicking her in the kidneys and when Jed took a Bowie knife out of his boot, he exchanged a tab of Ecstasy he'd "been saving for an emergency" for it before Jed got around to carving his initials in her face.

Soemthing was definitely off with her balance. She listed along bent over from the pain in her kidneys. It burned like fire when she peed in the snow and whatever she was peeing looked dark as ink. What had been torn with Jed alternate butt fucking her and pounding at her between her legs, she had no idea.

> When he'd finished the whiskey and who knows how many beers, he experimented with different ways of choking her and that's when Frankie got out of the truck and offered him a tab of Ecstasy he just happened to have in his jacket "in case of emergency." The two of them started horsing around playing a slap-hands game that Frankie kept winning and she lay face down on the ground with her face in the snow, hoping they'd forget about her.
>
> Frankie's coat smelled like motor oil and sweat. She was shivering so hard, she was glad to have it but it was hard to tell if she was cold or adrenalin and fear had buzzed her into the next century. If Frankie hadn't traded Jed his Bowie knife for the two tabs of Ecstasy he had in his pocket, she didn't want to think about where he would have carved his initials.
>
> Frankie turned out to be the surprise of the night. He wouldn't do doubles, when Jed wanted her to go down on Frankie while he was fucking her from behind. He broke Jed's choke hold on her neck when she was about to pass out and then distracted him from further choke games with a tab of ecstasy he'd been saving "for an emergency."
>
> As long as she kept walking, she'd be OK, Frankie had promised her. That's what kept her going as she skated one boot out in front of the other for what seemed like endless night.

A yellow light in the window of a trailed marked Office in the RV Court at Wolf Lodge beckoned to her like a match light. She dragged herself up the steps and leaned on the bell. A woman in a pale blue bathrobe with pink bunnies opened the door and screamed. "Oh my God, honey. What happened to you?" the woman gasped.

"Oh my good God Damn," the woman gasped when she caught sight of Lydia. She bellowed for somebody named Alvin to call the ambulance. At the same time, she bundled Lydia into a ferociously warm room with a barking dog and a cat that had to be booted off the couch where she tenderly laid Lydia down and wrapped a purple afghan around her from head to toe. "Oh, honey," she kept murmuring. "You're a mess."

It turned out that Alberta Fulsome knew Margaret. One of her kids or nephews or someone related went to school with someone else. She heard all this when the gave Alberta the phone number for Inner Horizons and Albert told Margaret to meet them at Providence Sacred Heart hospital in Spokane.

The rest was fragments. The grimace of a bearded EMT. Red flashing lights that turned her hand purple on a white sheet. Alberta refused to let her ride alone in the ambulance and she rode with the woman holding her hand while the medics worked on her as if she wasn't there.

Alberta's hand told her differently. It was very warm and she laid Lydia's small hand on her pillowy breast and kept one well padded arm around her shoulders to steady her when they turned off the freeway to howl through the streets of downtown Spokane. "I got you" the woman said in her motherly voice and Lydia chose to believe her.

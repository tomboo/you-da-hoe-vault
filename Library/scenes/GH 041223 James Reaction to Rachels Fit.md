GH 041223 James Reaction to Rachels Fit

James' parents could afford to throw a brand new Mercedes off a cliff every three months like they did when they wrote the check for his quarterly fees to Inner Horizons. Dad, CEO of a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, and a neurosurgeon, were both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, reminded him in today's therapy session. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked. James' answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

James parents were always asking him why he did what he did. Sometimes he even asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time" was the only answer that made any sense to him.

It didn't seem to him when he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on weed or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka from his dad's liquor cabinet\-- that he had trouble staying on task or that he got easily distracted.

Once in a good moment with Dr. Mom, the neurologist and brain surgeon whom Susan was a clone of, he asked her why he and Susan were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system can talk to your frontal cortext."

He'd looked up the limbic system that he now understood as the lizard brain where all his fears and fuck-ups lived, he assumed. The frontal cortex housed the decision-making parts of his brain.

He commented to his mom when they were having pizza on the way to abasketball game that his frontal cortex must be the size of a walnut." Oh, no, James," she said. "It's the right size. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to your limbic system yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections. "Time," she said, matter-of-factly. "Only time makes the brain connect."

Maybe that's why Susan had a high round forehead. All those connections she was making when she got straight A's in AP classes when he barely got into Cal State with a basketball scholarship. All Susan's connections made her brain bulge out and James' lack of them went to his flat feet.

He refused to think about the hours and hours Susan spent in her room or at the library studying while he was out partying or stoned on weed leaving his homework to get done (or not) in the 10 minutes between class changes. It was just a girl thing that plain and freckled Susan did what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by a flurry of texts and IMs from his pals.  It wasn't like either James or Susan had grown up unloved or neglected. Sure, they had nannies when they were little but Dr. Mom and Dad always made time for them. Dad came to all his basketball games, even when he traveled, and Mom made him videotape James's games if she had a long surgery so she could watch them later. She complained bitterly about Dad's shitty camera work so she must have watched quite a lot.

James just seemed unable to stop himself from any shiny thing that called out to him. A party tonight in the Canyon? Susan would say, "I have to study for my Calc test" and James would be texting A3. Anytime, anywhere, any place.

One of the stupid family stories Dad loved to tell was about the day he had to leave a board meeting because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to preschool and James and the Schwarzenegger kid are having PB&J sandwiches and grape juice," Dad would say. "There's the Schwarzenegger with his arm around James, drinking out of the same glass." Then Maria Shriver calls up and says James left a perfect bite mark on her kid's left buttock.

"'I told James to bite his tongue next time,'" Dad would say. "Or at least wait till after the board meeting." As if James could control his urge to strike out which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. There was no planning involved. The impulse came and he bit down.

It was only later, like the moment he stared at the crazy pattern in the safety glass of his shattered windshield, that he realized it wasn't as fun as it had promised.

"What the shit?" he cried when the new girl whose name he'd forgotten landed in his lap. Her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his 16^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at the blond girl's face upside down. Her pupils were rolled up like a window shade, white and mapped with tiny red capillaries you couldn't follow.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get Bruce!" she shouted. Then, pointing at Lydia, she shouted, "Call 9-1-1!"

Half sprawled on James and half on the carpet, the girl began flopping like a carp. Everybody in Process Group perched on the edge of their seats watching her as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between thankfulness that the seizure put an end to the accountability bull shit and truly appalled at the sight of Bruce, the burly van driver, kneeling on the girl's elbows while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James laid his hands on her thin, long legs and he felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if she were being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, while James held on with all of his strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying-on of hands on a person seized by electricity, impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. The girl's body had a will and an agenda all its own. He glanced at Lydia and tried to catch her eye, wondering if the bodily high-jacking shook her as much as it shook him. She was plucking something out of Darlene's purse and wasn't even tuned into girl's seizure.

After a bone jarring shiver that started at her head and rolled through the girl's body the way a dog shook off water, her eyes -- a bruise-darkened blue -- popped open. She glanced around the cluster of unfamiliar faces and James had the impression she was thinking she'd woken up in hell. Consciousness spread slowly over her face, followed by a deep blush of shame. The monster is out of the closet, James read, and it is me.

"Are you OK?" Darlene asked her. James squeezed her hand, feeling fingers thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then catching his eye, dropped his hand as if she'd been burned.

Darlene and Bruce decided to load her into the Suburban and take her in to Kootenai Hospital. It was 20 miles away but it would be faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Gretchen, the Dietician, in charge. At least Gretchen wouldn't be touching food while she was busy supervising the group they left behind. James couldn't understand how even her carrot sticks tasted weird.

By then, Process Group was officially toast.

Everybody replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Lydia, to whom everything always came around to sex, said she thought the new girl fell in James' lap because she was trying to give James a blow job. "I thought I'd have to fight her off," she said. Reza, his motormouth room mate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants. "Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

"They must have known she was epileptic!" Old Girl was pissed off. "What the fuck's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

Usually James avoided Old Girl so she wouldn't rip him a new asshole with her razor tongue. The girl was pretty scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. He was familiar with her unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look because he'd seen it so often at the bottom of a tequila bottle. Which was why he surprised himself by saying, "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

Paul, the mammoth Aspbergery math wizard, who never spoke, said, "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean she looked like the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like a ghost had spoken.

"What are you looking at?" Paul said. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

Everybody laughed. Paul went back to doodling equations on the back of his hand.

Lydia bumped into James from behind, the sign she wanted to fuck. How could she even think about fucking when he was shaking at the core?

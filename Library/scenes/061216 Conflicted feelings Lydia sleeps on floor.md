061216 Conflicted feelings Lydia sleeps on floor

When at last she was completely naked, her skin starting to goose bump from the cold, she went to the shared closet.

She drew out the gold foil-covered box from under a bunch of towels where she'd hid it from Esty's pawing. It exploded from its heart a gush of crumpled white tissue. She skirted the bed and propped the photo of Rahel and Aldo in Portofino next to the lamp so she could see it when she laid down.

In her shock at Dr. Hazey's office, all she had seen was how Rahel had taken her out of the scene. Now she was able to appreciate the expert retouching job. It looked so real, as if her mother really had been the object of Aldo's admiration, that she almost doubted her own memories of that lovely spring day in Positano. They had strolled as a threesome on the narrow winding streets of the old town. Aldo bought them all cappuccinos and he taught her how to shoot the tiny cups of espresso like a man.

In the flat yellow light, she saw a few things she had missed in her shocky, gut-punched state while under her mother's avid gaze. Aldo's handsome thick-haired head was turned in profile. His only visible eye revealed a glint of what she initially read as rapture and in her maturity, she saw as lust. Her mother (not me, Lydia reminded herself) was laughing at the person behind the camera (who was really her) with smirking, I-know-something-you-don't grin. She tried to reach back in memory and remember the exact moment her mother snapped the picture. What had Aldo been whispering in Lydia's ear? Why did he grip her knee so hard the skin underneath went white?

She couldn't raise the moment of the snap but

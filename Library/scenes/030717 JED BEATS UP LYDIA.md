JED BEATS UP LYDIA

On the drive up into the mountains to the north of Post Falls, Jed fumed in silence like a furnace. Frankie O glanced at her in the rearview mirror, a frown line between his eyes. She couldn't tell where they were going other than deep into the steep slopes that piled up like shingles outside of Post Falls. The road was plowed until they made a hard right, and then they jolted over snowy ruts for a long time. At last, they reached a clearing on a flat-topped butte. The shooting gallery at Signal Point.

Jed had made Frankie O zip-tie her hands behind her when they grabbed her in the NICC parking lot. He yanked her out of the cab by one wrist and wrenched her shoulder the wrong way. When he shoved her to her knees and pushed her face down in the snow, she knew it wasn't going to be pretty. He yanked her boots off first. Tossed them over his shoulder. Then he jerked her pants off her legs heaving at her while her head bounced on rocks buried the snow.

"Better pray now," he said "because you won't know how by the time I'm done."

There was deep snow all around the clearing but the plateau itself had been roughly flattened by cars and a lot of foot traffic. Frankie O had been at the kegger on the weekend. No keg now but beer cans and bottles glinted when the clouds let the moon peep through A Barca lounger sat on top of a large boulder like a throne.

"I'm sorry," she said, when Frankie O unzipped his pants and pulled his purple-gray dick out. "who are you?"

"What's it to you, bitch?" Jed cuffed her on the side of her head as she tried to work Frankie's unprepared dick into action. "He's a cunt who owes me a favor," he said, "just like you."

Apparently the favor involved letting Jed butt-fuck him while Lydia gave him a blow job but whatever Jed was doing to Frankie in the rear interfered with Frankie's ability to keep it up. His dick kept slipping out of her mouth while Jed held him by the hips and thrust at him like a jack hammer.

"Act like you like it, cunt," he told Frankie."

Apparently Jed had some idea of doing target practice. He said he was going to make her kneel on her hands and knees and pile stuff on her back like she was a table top. He called her 'bullet catcher' most of the way into the mountains until he switched to 'bullet stopper' when they reached a flat plateau on top of a small butte.

Jed and the feral kid drive 'so he could get shit faced' and he slapped her on her bare ass through the opening between the seats. They had hog tied her with zip ties at ankles and wrists. "You'll see how fun it is to be fucked up," he said. "Too bad fat ass Maggie Leary ain't here to save you."

She couldn't see anything with her face mashed in the leather upholstery unless she craned her neck to peer through the space between the seats. A bottle of Jim Beam passed back and forth between the driver and Jed like a baton. There were a lot of turns. Once, the truck fishtailed like a dying salmon and Jed said, "Wreck my truck and I'll wreck you." Frankie shrank deep in his brown down jacket and just drove. He reminded her of a turtle who was keeping his neck protected so it didn't get bitten off.

The truck ground up a series of switch backs on a plowed road that made her car sick. Then they made a hard turn and immediately slalomed into something hard with a metallic crunching sound. The truck bounced. Shuddered. "Fucking shit for brains! What'd you hit?"

It turned out to be a refrigerator on its side with a thick mushroom covering of snow. In Frankie O's defense, it looked like drift of snow had formed irregular lumps and bumps in a rough half-circle around the clearing.

"Shoot your fucking foot off, you fucking piss ant!" Jed kept up a nonstop litany of curses at Frankie's O's driving and then he punched him in the stomach and knocked him down in the snow. He went practically apopletic when he realized he couldn't find the key to the gun rack.

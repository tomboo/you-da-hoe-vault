Rounding out Rusty

-- Write about Rusty\'s upbringing without a mother and a neglectful, sadistic father.

-- Write about something Rusty leaves that upends expectation. Just because he\'s cracked doesn\'t make him inhuman and maybe he\'s got a dog he loves who\'s old and dying and that\'s the thing that sets him off.

-- Write about the care he takes to set up the trailer so it\'s got many things to please Rachel. He could see a wedding dress in a consignment shop and buy it and he could ask for it to be wrapped up nice, lined with tissue like a present he once saw being unwrapped at a class birthday party.

\"How tall is she?\" the woman asks.

\"About yay big,\" he says holding his hand at shoulder height. \"She\'s needs to eat more.\"

Twinkies. He could add Twinkies and Oreos to the list of stuff he needs to buy.

-- Write about his lack of wrapped presents. The old man bring stuff, sure, \_\_\_ and [Linkin Logs]{.underline}, but they\'d just show up without any wrapping paper or ribbons.

-- Rusty knows junk-- the value of auto parts and chairs that can be stripped and stained and oiled to a sheen. Maybe he\'s been working on a rocking chair for the container. He remembers an old glider they used to have on the porch, how he\'d rock back and forth until he hit the wall of the house one too many times and his Dad sold it.

[Setting:]{.underline}

It\'s interesting that I focused on character and their arcs and left out most of the scene setting.

-- Go back to Rachel\'s scenes and let her tell most of the setting details and how the rules and [regs]{.underline} of the treatment facility work.

-- Do a setting pass thru the novel and make sure each scene has 2-3 grounding details to make the setting visual.

I see Healing House as a ranch house with two long wings and a central house core with kitchen, dining and living areas.

Maybe it looks like a ranch house with a long girls wing that was added on and the boys wing isn\'t visible from the front parking lot. It sticks out in the back so if you looked at it from overhead it would like a stubby y.![C:\\Users\\Shy\\Desktop\\Untitled-1.jpg](./media/image1.jpeg){width="4.614583333333333in" height="2.5520833333333335in"}

Why a y? Y not.

Stable is just an old \_\_\_ bungalow stuck out in the winter-lands so that running is impossible unless you have the stamina to walk 18 miles to town.

Hazey has bought a variety of ramshackle properties around town rather than investing in a commercial building to centralize operations. Maybe that\'s what he needs the loan for to consolidate his empire.

[Bring up Esty and Josh:]{.underline}

After I get the chronology written down and lock the time frame on a visual map, I can decide whether to write a few more scenes to bring Esty forward.

-- Write a scene of her stabbing someone with a fork?

-- Figure out if Josh the only black man in Idaho is a character to bring forward. All the kids feel isolated as \"crazies\" and Josh relates to their isolation only he actually sees the Coeur d\'Alene residents heads whip around when he walks by. His wife Allene teaches at NICC but they are transient here-- how could you subject a child to white-only Idaho where the kid would always be an oddity. At least in Alabama where he grown up you were \_\_ in a group.

[YA or Lit Fiction:]{.underline}

YA is a growing robust market with lots of potential for sales and building an audience. Lit fiction is narrow and hard to sell--and in reality the novel can be beautifully written rich in metaphor and it can delight adults and kids 14-22 just as well.

If I self-pubs, the work of SEO categorizing the novel into YA categories and literary fiction can happen easily, much easier to be in both worlds on \_\_ than it is in the traditional publishing.

[Warm Up Old Girl:]{.underline}

I was surprised that Wav found OG more aloof and colder than I do. OG\'s youth makes me feel instant sympathy for her but maybe I need to warm her?

-- I could make her scattered planning more like executive function failures. She doesn\'t have it all together because she can\'t -- but that makes it hard for reader to follow unless I make explicit her realization that her planning is always getting fucked up because she only has the letters of the alphabet not a full language.

-- I could write more about why she has to kill herself. It\'s a compulsion that\' been with her for a long time. \"I could just jump,\" she remembers thinking when she was nine and high in a tree at David and Polly's (her mom\'s sisters) house. The recurring thought took over after her mom and dad were killed. Maybe she just wanted to join Mom and Dad or maybe it was exactly what Hazey had told her at her intake session. \"It\'s a chemical thing and we just need to reset the chemistry.\" Maybe if they reset her chemistry she wouldn\'t have been up a tree in the first place.

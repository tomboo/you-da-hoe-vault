110114 Old Girl wants

What if all you ever wanted since you were nine-years-old was to climb up as far as you could in the world's highest tree and let yourself drop? What if you peeked in your Aunt Peggy's medicine cabinet and a box of Ex-Lax sang a siren song to you like a box of chocolates you would die for? If you were sitting in the passenger seat of Uncle David's car and turned onto Reserve Street from South Avenue, would you imagine holding your hand on the door handle and letting the station wagon door swing wide like a draw bridge over gray asphalt that glided below your dangling feet like sand paper and called to you to let go?

Now you know why I'm at Healing House at Inner Horizons in the middle of rural Idaho with kids between 19 and 21 who are just as crazy as I am. Want to join me?

What if you lost your mother and dad and your baby brother Gabe to a geriatric and blind senior citizen who couldn't tell the difference between the gas pedal and the brake? What if all you could ever remember dreaming about was climbing the world's highest tree and letting yourself fall like a stone? Could you imagine opening the medicine cabinet at Aunt Peggy's, and hearing an aspirin bottle calling to you like a siren? Could you imagine riding in the station wagon next to Uncle David and propping your hand on the door handle so your body could swing out between the unlatched door and gray asphalt that slides beneath your dangling feet like pebbled sandpaper. Would you know the exact moment when to let go?

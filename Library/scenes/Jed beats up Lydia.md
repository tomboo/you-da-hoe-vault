NED WAS WAITING NEAR THE NICC PICK-UP STOP. He idled along behind Lydia, driving a few feet from her on Garden Street. Keeping up with her pace.

Through the open passenger window, he called, "Hey, bitch, you owe me."

The bench, half a block up ahead, was empty.

A young couple passed her on the street side, close to Jed's truck. They were holding hands, engaged in conversation. The girl glanced the idling truck with idle curiosity. It felt to Lydia, like the truck was walking her, tethered by an invisible leash. Should she turn around and run toward the couple? Would they help her get away?

She sped up, though it didn't matter if she got to the bench any faster. No one else was there. No one was going to be there, because she was fifteen minutes early. So much for New Year's resolutions.

"Get in," Jed said. "Time to suck dick."

Movement in the jump seat behind Ned. A thin wiry man stepped out of the still-moving truck before Lydia realized Ned wasn't alone. He snaked behind her and lifted her off her feet like an unwieldy package. In seconds, she found herself face face down on the narrow back seat, being kneed in the back. Ned's friend was zip tying her ankles to her hands like a cow puncher.

Jed sang off-key. "Me and Frankie O and the cock tease. Now she's going to say please , ain't she?"

Blue velour mashed into Lydia's face. A tongue full of fluff. The squeeze on her lungs from Frankie's weight made it hard to breathe.

"You wanna go first, Frankie O?" Jed asked, conversationally. "Or I could pump her in the back door while she sucks your dick." He reached between the seats and yanked Lydia's hair. "You're good at sucking dick, aren't you."

She reared up and tried to fling Frankie off her back. "Let me out!"

Jed kept up his patter as if she hadn't spoken. "No, I'll fuck her first and you can watch. You owe me."

Lydia lifted her head to make herself heard. "Where are you taking me?"

"Wolf Ridge."

Frankie O dangled a roll of duct tape in front of her. "You going to shut up?" It looked like they were driving east on I-90 out of Couer d'Alene toward Look Out Pass. Oh, what the hell. She shook her head at the duct tape. No one could hear her scream.

Frankie slithered sideways through the opening into the front seat. Frankie O wasn't much bigger than she was. Scrawny and underfed enough to winkle through the bucket seats like an eel. He smelled of motor oil and cigarettes. Red angry welts pitted his face.

Jed fiddled with the radio, while the truck drifted, then swerved, as he locked on to a country station playing Shania Twain. "That Don't Impress Me Much." He sang through his adenoids to the refrain.

"What are you doing?"

"Don't you remember what Maggie Leary did to me? Interfering fat bitch." Jed paused. "I wish she was here so I could fuck her up too."

Somewhere on the way---Lydia figured it was East Coeuer d'Alene, Jed stopped at a Circle K for beer. When they got back in the truck, Frankie drove so Jed could get shit faced. "You'll see how fun it is to get beat up," he said, slapping Lydia on the ass. "Too bad fat ass Maggie Leary and her big ass purse ain't here. I could whale her on her when I'm done with you."

Lydia couldn't see much except dusty blue upholstery unless she craned her neck to look through the opening between the bucket seats. Mostly she saw a bottle of Jim Beam being pass back and forth from Jed to Frankie like a relay baton. After they turned off the freeway, they made lot of turns. Once, the truck fishtailed like a dying salmon and Jed warned Frankie, "Wreck my truck and I'll wreck you."

Frankie O drove with his skinny neck turtled down deep in a green down jacket. He looked like he was keeping his head in so it didn't get bitten off.

The truck ground up a series of hills. At one point, when the engine began to labor, Frankie O switched into four-wheel drive. Lydia's neck hurt and all she could see were blue-black trees and white endless hills. An occasional house light gleamed like a candle in the darkness but those distant glows disappeared as they ground up hill. She was close to throwing up from the switchbacks when the truck made a hard left. They careened into something hard with metallic crunch. They bounced to a stop.

Ned hollered. "Fucking shit for brains! What'd you hit?"

It turned out to be a beat-up refrigerator on its side in the snow. It was half-buried. A busted door spilled snow from a pink interior like a white tongue. It was lying in the middle of a large clearing littered with other garbage.

"I should shoot your fucking foot off, you fucking piss ant!" Jed made Frankie haul Lydia out the truck, still zip-tied. Then he punched him in the stomach till Frankie was bent over and retching next to Lydia who lay on her belly in the snow.

They were in a clearing, roughly dozed flat by a grader that was using it as a turn around. Snow walls were piled up around it in a partial circle that was carved out of a hill. Frankie O said he'd gotten fucked up at a kegger there last weekend. Besides getting shit faced, they used it as a shooting range. Hundreds of spent bullet casings pocked the snow. Whiskey bottles and crushed beer cans and Cheeto bags stuck out of dirty trampled snow. On a boulder, a Barca lounger sat like a throne above a sodden couch and a shot-out TV. Ponderosa trees lined the perimeter with hacked off and broken branches scarred down to heartwood.

Ned approached her with a Bowie knife, then sawed at the zip ties. "Better pray now," he said. "Because you won't know how by the time I'm done."

LYDIA WAKES UP & WALKS

She brushes at something frozen in her eyelashes like a diamond. One eyes is glued shut. The other is fogged over with something sticky and wet. When she's able to squeeze open one eye, Inky dark leaks light from a million pin pricks overhead.

A poke. A hard shake wobbles her head back and forth in a shimmy of pain.

For a second, she thinks that Ned is going to start in on her again.

No. Only Frankie O bending over and saying something warm in her ear.

"Wake up!" He's yanking at her fucked up shoulder. His voice comes from a distance as far off as the milky stars. "You can't go to sleep."

Frankie O wrestles and paws at her until she finds herself up on pin-prickled feet. She wobbles like a drunk until he steadies her at the elbows. She can't stop herself from leaning into his scrawny chest. In dim, silver moon light, the expression on his thin ferret-like face is blue and grim. His acne looks like it's been gauged into his face with an ice pick.

"Put this on."

Now he's shoving a green ski jacket at her. Lydia feels the warmth on it from his body before she figures out he wants her to wear it. It smells of motor oil and sweat but it feels amazing. Soft and downy as a pillow.

"'M fine. 'M OK," she mumbles. All she wants to do is lie down and close her eyes again and go to sleep.

He continues to poke at her and manhandles her arms into the sleeves while he's spewing words at her in some incomprehensible language. "...all you gotta do is walk. Coupla' miles. That's all. Coupla miles downhill. When you get to the highway, just hitch a ride."

She nods because she can tell he really wants her to understand something but everything out of his mouth sounds like sleep, go to sleep, keep walking, and you'll go to right to sleep.

She sways in a rising wind, like a leaf. One sleeve hangs off her shoulder. The silver zipper glints when she looks down at pale white legs.

"Not that way!" He's back. He re-aims her out of the clearing she remembers driving into years ago. Snow pockmarked with red bullet casings. She remembers lying in a drift with her hands and feet tied behind her. Her hands are free now, but her shoulder seizes up with red heat when she tries to move it,

A whiny torrent lifts over the rumble of an idling engine in the middle of a plume of white smoke. "Piss Ant! Move your pecker or I'm leaving!" It's Ned's voice coming from a long way off. His voice comes out of the white exhaust like a whiff of steam.

"You'll be OK once you get to the highway." Frankie O zips the jacket. Yanks the sleeves down to cover Lydia's blue-white wrists. She's surprised her to see that she's naked from the waist down. Her thighs are goosebumped like turkey wattle which doesn't seem to faze Frankie O in the least.

Good thing I am wearing Smart Wool, she thinks, noting clumps of snow and ice crystals pilling the socks around her ankles. Smart wool for a dumb girl who only has to keep walking.

*CuntSuckDickShitForBrain,You PissAnt!* Frankie O hollers something back about holding his horses, so a man can take a piss, then lopes off in the direction of the noise like a wolf.

The truck fishtails out of the clearing in a smog of exhaust and sulfur yellow ight.

Jed, hanging out of the passenger window like a feral dog, hoots and barks. "Have a good time," Jed shouts. "Fuck all the coyotes you want!"

For a long time, the warbling sound of Good Night Lucille reaches back to her with the grinding engine. It takes quite a while for her to raise her head. It take even longer to understand in a world of white and and black shadow she's completely alone.

Red fire burns a hollow between Lydia's legs.

Jed's face looms in and out of focus.

*On your knees, bitch. Ass in the air.*

She remembers a heavy weight grinding her face in the snow while the weight of an animal grunts and pants on top of her.

*She's had enough!*

*...teach the whore to shame me.*

She stumbles head down, following the tire tracks, half-hunched over because if she stands up straight, she can't take in a full breath. She feels emptied out. A seepage from between her legs leaves a dark trail behind her. She wonders if her insides will leak out of her at the same time the the black covering of sky will fill in all the pinpricks above her. The dark trail she's leaving behind her is an unraveling thread.

All she can think about is how good it felt to lie down after Jed finally got tired of whaling on her. A bone deep tiredness clutches at her, like gravity, as if a mountain lion has climbed onto her back and clawed its way deep in her kidneys. It would feel so good to lie down now.

Tall purple-black Ponderosa hunch over the road like impassive soldiers. A snow clump startles her with its whumpf, but soon, she's too tired to even look in the direction of more intermittent crashes and snow swirls.

A lumbering and ungainly dance with Jed. He holds her in a headlock and windmills a flurry of punches at her ears.

Jed yanks a boot off in a rage.

The sight of one Ferragamo whizzing like the hand of a clock over a ravine.

The fiery drag of her bare ass across ice and grit as Jed pulls her jeans off inside out and leaves them like a carcass in the snow.

Up until this night, Lydia's relationship with Ned the cowboy has been transactional. Your dick. My lips. Your money. In and out like a cash machine

Now she realizes that the impersonal is very personal. Her nose drips dark and wet onto the ground like a faucet. If she had Margaret's pipe wrench, she could fix it.

"Christ." Frankie O's intake of breath that whooshes out in a gush. "He musta busted your nose."

Whatever Ned has done to her, it has affected her balance.

She pitches and yaws along the tire tracks like a rudderless ship. When she finds herself swaying at an edge that drops into thin air, she has to will her body to turn and stumble away from the invitation of nothingness.

Back in light-polluted Detroit, she used to think of the brightness of Idaho's stars as diamond like and infinite. Now she sees that the opposite is true. The darkness is wearing off the crystalline sharpness of the stars overhead. The tunneling of her vision confirms that blackness is winning by filling in the pinpricks of light.

Lydia tries to follow the ruts left by Ned's wheels but that's a mistake. One foot skates out from underneath her on a sheen of ice. She sprawls painfully to her hands and knees. When she manages to wobble to her feet, she feels a thousand years old.

After that, she sticks to the deeper, clotted snow between the tire tracks. She holds her arms out and toddles along like an old woman, body tensed as if expecting the worst. But hasn't the worst already happened at the clearing? How much worse can it get?

A confused memory comes to her of faceplanting in front of a shot-out TV. Her eyes are level with the busted-out screen. Jed is kicking her in the back while her head repeatedly bangs against the woodgrain. Panasonic. Life is better in living color.

Jed back-hands her until she falls backwards over the door of a half-buried oven. She tried at first to hold her hands in front of her face but it isn't wasn't long before she gave up and curled on the ground like a grub, forcing Ned to yank her up and punch the stuffing out of her like a scarecrow.

Why not just lie back now and watch the darkness obliterate the stars?

She can't figure out where her Ferragamos went. The boots are on her feet are too big and paint spattered. They slop and galumph as she kicks her toes forward and lets the heel float free like she's skating to the moon.

Ned tossed her pants in a ravine, she remembers. Her pink thong ended up rolled around one ankle like a wedding garter. The undies keep interfering when she takes a step but it takes her forever to bend over to take it off. If she falls down, she doesn't think she will be able to stand up.

Frankie O's coat smells like sweat and humanity. Frankie O didn't join Ned in the punch fest. He'd hovered in the background, looking worried and scared. He distracted Ned with a new beer when he started kicking her. And when the Bowie knife came out and Jed wanted to carve his initials in her face, Frankie magically found a tab of Ecstasy that he'd "been saving for an emergency."

After that, Ned and Frankie downed beer after beer in some kind of drinking game that involved slapping at each other's hands. Every time Ned lost, he had to drink, and by then, the Ecstasy had kicked in, he was babbling at the stars and doing jumping jacks and yelling about lighting pinwheels and rooster rockets on the Fourth of July.

A long argument about whether to take the girl or leave her behind. Jed wants to leave her on the mountain "so the bitch can learn her lesson." Frankie O says they've scared and fucked with her enough. He says she can ride in the truck bed if Ned is worried about his upholstery.

By then, Lydia has been lying naked or kneeling in the snow for hours. All she is conscious of is a fire between her legs. She has no opinion about going or staying. There is a state of grace when you are too fucked up to care.

What gets her hobbling forward again is the crunch of teeth on bones.

Twenty yards ahead, past a switch back that doubles back along a moonlit slope, a mountain lion crouches flat on all fours. It's chewing on something dark and steaming between its paws.

Yellow cougar eyes, split pupils, indifferent, and full of disdain, sweep over her. The cougar's mouth clamps a disembowelled rabbit between razor sharp teeth.

Lydia is too numb to be afraid.

The cat isn't interested in her. It has already hunted and killed its prey. After a few seconds of it looking at her and her looking at it, the cat picks up the rabbit trailing its entrails in its mouth, and trots past her. It is going deeper into the wilderness. Back to a warm winter den.

It is the thought of the den that prompts Lydia to start searching at the foot of the spruce trees and Douglas firs and Ponderosas lining the road. Creatures sometimes bedded down in the tree wells, Gracie, her old guide, told her a million years ago. Especially if the snow was deep. Deep, compacted snow in tree wells insulated the ground and kept forest animals warmer than bare frozen earth. Another of nature's survival strategies.

After the cat melts into dimness, she stumbles on. The white road becomes a treadmill passing the same thing. Black triangular trees with white overloaded branches. Even the occasional whumpfs of falling snow can't jolt her out of her lethargy.

She has no clue how far or how long she's been walking since Frankie shoved her feet into his work boots and told her to not to stop. Time hasn't lost its meaning, it just feels pointless to put one foot in front of the other. Her feet have been numb since the clearing. She can't feel her nose or her lips. Even her thoughts seemed to be congealing and slowing as if the cold has worked from her naked skin deep inside her body.

As she plods along, she has a strange feeling that she exists in two planes of time.

She is at once hiking down the foothills of Wolf Ridge while she is also hiking up and down the trails of most of the national parks of the western United States.

She's on the hiking tour when she was 15 that was billed as a "greatest hits" of America's National Parks: Yellowstone, Gran Targhee and the Tetons, Sequoia National Forest with its mammoth ghost trees, Rainier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness and Glacier Park in Montana, and the Pasayten Wilderness of the North Cascades.

The guide she fell in love with, was a horse-faced graduate level botanist. A bee expert named Grace. Gracie took Lydia under her wing because no one else would.

You were supposed to be at least 15 but because her 15^th^ birthday was in August, at the very end of the trip, they made an exception for her. The age exception was a surefire way to exclude Lydia from the company of the majority of the other campers who were mostly 16 or 17. Nobody, including the camp counselors, wanted to hang with a stick-thin, motor-mouth fourteen-year-old with low self-esteem which is how Lydia ended up trotting up and down 600 miles of high subalpine trails over ten weeks at Gracie's heels learning about high country flora and fauna.

The first two weeks of break-in were heinous but after the first 90 miles, the kids acquired the speed and stamina of mountain goats. Lydia went from hating every moment and everyone around her to loving every minute of every day and finally, falling deeply in love with Gracie.

Gracie kept Lydia's mind busy, while forcing her to develop her visual skills, and she equipped Lydia with her own sketch book with a daily assignment. By the end of the summer, Lydia learned to find, identify, and record all kinds of plant species including the Latin names, of everything from the subvarieties of lupine to 21 varieties of Indian paint brush.

To her endless surprise, she loved cataloguing the endless variety of survival techniques of the high country plants.

Gracie had taken the guiding job so that she could work on her botanical research while getting paid to babysit. ("I put up with you little assholes because I get to be around the most beautiful plants in the world," she was always telling them.) A research paper that was due when she got back to UC Davis was supposed to be accompanied by a survey of all the botanical specimens that grew above 5000 feet of elevation. Compared to Gracie's stubby, pedestrian pencil sketches, Lydia's drawings were minute and delicate with nuance and detail that surprised everyone, including herself. Soon, Lydia took over the identification and drawing tasks while Gracie worked on her hypothesese and conclusions.

Lydia had never been needed. She was used to being superfluous to her mother who shuttled her off to nannies or au pairs when she was little and later on, to expensive private schools. To be told what she was drawing was beautiful, that her eye for design and detail was good, that what she was doing was useful, shocked her. And when Gracie told her she was depending on her help, she fell in love. At the end of the summer, she packed up the sketch book with its studies of the lily of Parnassus, pearly everlasting, pasque flowers and Jacob's ladder.

She is thinking of that trip and all the delicate and wildly diverse plants of the high country that are now buried under the snow around her. In the brutally short growing season of the high country, pressured by extreme elevation, extreme winds, and extreme cold, the summer plants shot up in a frenzy of fragile revolt. Indian paintbrush, lupine, shooting stars, glacier lilies, avalanche lilies mouse-on-a-stick, mats of clover, heart leaf arnica, purple asters, bear grass, popcorn plants, spreading phlox, red and pink and white heather, gillia gentian, monks hood, camas with its deadly bulbs.

As long as Lydia could keep listing all the flowers and plants she had drawn, she could keep placing one foot in front of her. Thimble berry, salmon berry, wild strawberries, alpine raspberry, choke cherry, bitter brush, lady fern, sword fern, maiden hair ferns, deer fern. She wondered what was happening to the bitterbrush and choke cherry and all the plants weighted down by months of snow. Were they crushed? Flattened? Or just dormant now under the six feet of snow that covered them.

The names were stored somewhere deep in her brain. The locked drawer that held them must have been shaken loose by Jed's beating. Now that the punching and sex were over, she had the feeling that there was so little left of her, she wasn't even sure she was still the same girl. The plant list kept her feet on the never-ending ribbon of road that stretched on with no end.

Every plant had a creative strategy for surviving their harsh and unforgiving world. Some shot their stalks up high and fast toward the brief face of the son. Others spread low and sucked the nutrients out of rocks and scrags and scree. The heathers fought each other for narrow ecological niches: red heather had larger, low-to-the-ground foliage and more red-pink blooms than its competitor, white heather which was closer-to-the-ground, more slender with fewer creamy white bells.

She knew where the sketch book was, even with her shaken brain pan. It was still wrapped at the bottom of her summer clothes in the locked trunk at the end of her bed. After the fire at Healing House. When she looked at all the pages, she could barely remember the almost-15-year-old she had been, full of hope and usefulness that summer, face turned toward the light for the briefest time.

It is when she runs out of flower names that she lets herself sink to her knees. It feels so good to stop walking.

Nothing moving in the stillness. A faint rushing throb in the pines. The windy sound of water in the creek that paralleled the road. A violin rub of a bare tree branch brushing a tree trunk makes an other-worldly moan that is almost human. and part animal.

She curls up on her side, bare knees tucked up to her chest in the zipped up jacket like she's been foreshortened into a baby. The soft snow under her feels oddly warm in contrast to the deep blue cold she feels creeping up from the frozen ground into her bones.

It is beautiful in the silvered moon light.

All around her the snow looks soft and pillowy. Tussocks and hillocks flatten to rumpled bed clothes. There are no more hills to climb. No more roads to descend. A soft build up of snow whitens her exposed thighs, a product of the freshening wind. Her calves blue in the silvery light, look like mottled meat shrink -wrapped in a freezer. She closes her eyes and lets darkness steal over her. She isn't cold. She doesn't feel lonely.

She sees glacier lilies, so vibrantly yellow and sunny during their short lives before they are buried under snow for the rest of the year. What color will she be when the dark night of winter comes to an end? Whose face will she see looking down into hers when she opens her eyes to the sun?

She is sorry she had never had enough money to pay Lorenzo back for all the French fries he bought her. Will he remember that she owes him? Will he remember her at all?

The experience of being terrorized and beaten and thinking Jed was going to kill her had made her feel smaller and smaller as the night wore on. By the end, when Jed was higher than a helium balloon and Frankie O was trying to push his coat on her for the walk down to the highway from Wolf Ridge, she felt like she'd gotten so small, the coat would swallow her. Once they ground down the hill in a smog of exhaust and sulfurous yellow headlights, she dropped the brown jacket in the snow like a body she was leaving behind.

Something is wrong with her ear. She caught snatches of conversation. Frank: ...taking a piss. Jed: ... little piss ant.

Lydia curled on the ground where Jed had finally left off kicking her. It felt good to just lie still. She was conscious of a bone deep tiredness like she'd run a marathon with everything she had and was now emptied out and hollow. Even the cold creeping into her bones felt good because it was putting out everything that was on fire inside her.

Then Frankie O was jerking at her arm and shaking her awake. She thought for a second that he was going to start in on her again. "Get up!" he was saying. "You can't go to sleep."

She found herself yanked upright, legs wobbling underneath her. He steadied her by holding onto her arm till she somehow balanced herself on feet that felt like wooden blocks. His narrow, ferrety face looked pale and stark in the silvery snow light. "Put this on." He was unzipping and shrugging out of his jacket and pushing it at her before she figured out what it wanted. The down was still warm from his body. It smelled smoky and musky and she couldn't seem to make her hands work to take it.

"No," she mumbled. "'m OK. Fine. Fine." From somewhere above herself, she saw herself thrusting the warmth of the jacket away from herself. All she wanted was to find the words that would make him go away so she could lie down and go back to sleep.

He held onto her by one arm and roughly manhandled her other arm into the coat like she was an unruly child. "All you gotta do is walk down hill. Coupla' miles. That's all, just keep walking."

She nodded as if agreeing to the words "keep walking" though by then she was parroting them because they had no more meaning than philosophy or differential equations. She shuffled obediently away from him with the jacket unzipped, one sleeve hanging off her shoulder.

"Not that way!" He caught her arm and aimed her toward the road that led downhill. Then, with Jed yelling at him to hurry up, he knelt in front of her and pulled the sleeves down over her wrists, then zipped the zipper all the way up to her chin. He ignored the fact that she was naked from the waist down except for her socks. When Jed had dragged her out of the cab to beat her, he ripped her pants off and tossed them over the cliff. They were somewhere down there in the bushes, she thought. Good thing she still had socks. Smart Wool. For a dumb girl who couldn't think beyond sinking to her knees to rest.

"Christ," Frankie O expelled a breath of steam. He kept wiping at the dark stickiness that was flowing from her nose, saying. "You're messed up."

She had started out terrified but as the night wore on and on, she lost any feeling at all and just closed her eyes hoping for it to be over. At one point, when Jed was shaking and choking her, Frankie O got out of the truck and distracted him with a tab of Ecstasy. "I've been saving it for an emergency," he said.

Between the bouts of slapping and punching, Jed hammered into her rear entry and shoved her face sback and forth in the snow until it was rubbed raw with rocks and grit. She swallowed a mouthful of snow, wishing she could disappear like the cold that was in her mouth an instant and then inexplicably gone before she could even swallow.

He'd pulled the fake-fur lined hood up but it was so big, the hood came down over her eyes and it felt like she was walking blind.

The truck switch-backed rhythmically down the hill and she watched the yellow cone of light swaying and rocking for a long time. It looked like the truck was making a figure skating move she'd learned as a child in Detroit, a kind of swaying backward motion that died into stillness when gravity ran out.

Frankie's worried expression flitted through her mind as she swayed on her feet looking out at the dim and silvery slope which seemed to be constantly moving like a silvered surf. "Keep walking." He sounded like a parrot who didn't know what the words meant but liked to hear itself talk. The words had barely registered in Lydia and she knew for a fact that Jed hadn't heard him or he would have objected to her bleeding on the upholstery. Frankie was driving so he was probably passed out in the front seat from all his exertions.

For the most part, Frankie O had stayed out of it while Jed was cursing and whaling on her. But then again, maybe this "keep walking" was a new part of the torture Jed had planned for her. She could hear a low moan of country music now and then from the cab where Frankie smoked dope with the windows crack. The smell of cigarette smoke came to her once when Jed got out of the truck to take a piss and lob beer cans out in the darkness.

Once the Ecstasy kicked in, Jed seemed to lose his focus. He staggered around the snowy clearing like he was both drunk and stoned and whined about needing to catch his breath. Frankie made an attempt to move her to the cab then but Jed went ape shit when he saw that her blood on his new light leather upholstery. That's how she ended up on her hands and knees behind the truck bed when they drove off.

Bare assed. Swaddled in a brown down coat with a wolf-ruffed hood. Who would know her from anyone else if she met someone on the road. The thought struck her oddly funy since the white world around her was full of blue-black Ponderosas and low hillocks of snowy bushes and the occasional mushroom hump of a boulder. Nothing else.

After a while, it just seemed like a lot of trouble to keep going. Why bother? Why work so hard for something he didn't even want. Staying upright was hard. Lying down would be so much easier.

The ground looked inviting. Pillowy soft and covered with a growing blanket of snow that promised rest and quiet without pain.

If she stayed upright, she would continue to struggle to draw breath and fight to drag the big, slipping boots forward one more step. The idea of the bottom of the hill seemed like such a distance she couldn't even imagine it. Frankie had said it wasn't very far. "A coupla miles." Had she even gone a mile yet? What was a mile when each step was one too many?

When one of the boots slipped forward on an icy patch, she landed awkwardly with one leg forward and the other bent under her. She'd been thinking about Lorenzo. Hoping he'd taken the Judith Lieber bag to the Luxe where he would have gotten the best price for it. The idea of the white silvery sequins and the winking kitten dangling form his big freckled paw made her smile. The kitten bag would help Lorenzo as it had never helped Lydia, except for the wicked sense of satisfaction she felt the day she stole it from her mother's closet. Would he remember her longer than it took for the money he got for it to be used up. It would be nice to be remembered by someone, she was thinking, as she sank forward on her knees in child's pose and closed her eyes and let the darkness erase her.

Lydia imagined herself in two moments of time.

She hurt and all she could think of was the sharp jagged pain in her lower back. The spot where Jed had kicked her with his cowboy boots burned like blue flame. To distance herself, she flew up above herself on the road that wound relentless down a series of switch backs at every bend.

Tall black trees lined the slope to her right like silent soldiers. A whumpf in the darkness startled her. Just a clump of snow succumbing to gravity. She imagined herself through a raven's eyes. A small white legged, forked creature in a dark hood. Zigzagging down a silent white road. Her path wandered from the tree side up slope to the opposite side of the road which disappeared into thin air. She had to reaim herself every few steps. Whatever Jed had done to her ear with his punches had affected her balance. She couldn't maintain a straight line so she had to stop when she got to the cliff and turn her whole body away from the invitation of thin air.

Time lost all meaning. Clouds skimmed and flowed past the gold coin of the moon. Its light glowed silver against the black fringe of Ponderosas that made her feel tiny and inconsequential. It was hard to think of any life going on in the bare, barren beauty of the Idaho wilderness.

. "Just what he says and you'll be OK," he said. "At least he can't shoot us."

"We could shoot him," she whispered.

"If things get out of hand," he said.

About an hour later she was wondering what the definition of 'out of hand" meant to Frankie. Shoving, punching, slapped, kneeing, kicking her in the kidneys with his cowboy boots, and choking her with his bare hands had gotten boring. Finally, when Jed told her to stay still so he could carve his initials in her neck with a Bowie knife, Frankie got out of the truck and called Jed over to take a tab of Ecstasy he kept in his pocket "for an emergency."

Lydia is hollow. The cold carves pieces out of her. First her feet go numb in the ridiculously oversized boots, then her hands quit working. Inside, she feels herself emptying out, half imagining that if she looked behind her as she walked, she would see a dark trail. There would be nothing standing where her body ought to be.

Instinctively she looks back but she sees exactly the same view behind her as what's ahead of her. A violet-white road where the shadowy trees on either side have darkened to impenetrable black.

She fell again and again, stumbling over a computer terminal and bar stool and TV console and a rungless ladder. In one particularly painful fall on a rusty mattress spring, she felt a sharp pain in the back of her thigh and she couldn't get free of the thing that was stuck in her hamstring. Jed yanked her up by one arm and whatever poked into her came with her so that for a second, she was attached to the springs like a jack-in-the-box.

After the Ecstasy kicked in, Jed staggered around the clearing, claiming to be able to see the Northern Lights. The only thing Lydia could see by then---in addition to not being able to hear ---was the greenish glow of the truck's dashboard which seemed to be blinking in time with Keith Church hitting his guitar face and crooning, "Love you baby, like a wreckin' ball."

\--Stars look like pinpricks in a black cloth. The impression she has is that milky light is leaking out of its black covering. Always before, she had thought of Idaho's stars---brighter than any stars you could see in light-polluted Detroit---were pushing infinite light at her from a great distance. Now she feels the opposite. Light is leaking from its source and soon, blackness will take over.

\--Looking down at the dark seepage running down the inside of her legs, she wonders if her insides are leaking out of her and at some point will join with or strengthen the black covering of sky which is filling in a million pinpricks.

\--When a cloud drifts over the moon, she feels a momentary optimism that the cloud cover will fill up the sieve of the night. But soon, the clouds move across the moon and the darkness gets more absolute.

Lydia tries to follow the ruts made by Jed's truck, thinking it will be easier to walk in the space left by the wheels, but soon realizes this is a mistake. She skates on the ice under the thin snow covering and falls painfully on one bare knee. It takes her quite a while to ease over onto her side and scrabble up onto both legs. She feels like she's a thousand years old, an old woman on her last legs, trying to make her way on a ground that is pitted and iced over like an abandoned ice rink.

At first, Lydia tried to follow in the ruts left by Jed's truck wheels but that's a mistake. One foot skated out from underneath her and sent her sprawling to her hands and knees. It felt like she'd landed on her kneecap on a sharp rock. When she managed to wobble to her feet, her knee looked dark and sticky in the uncertain light.

After several more falls on pitted and rutted ice---she stuck to the deeper, clotted ruck of snow along the road's edge. It was harder to make forward progress but at least she had enough traction to stay on her feet.

The treachery of the ice forced her to inch along like an old woman. She held her arms out, body tensed as if expecting the worst. But hadn't the worst already happened at the shooting range? How much worse could it get?

A confused image of landing in front of a shot-out TV, her eyes at the level of the broken-out screen. Jed was kicking her in the back while her head repeatedly banged the plastic woodgrain console. Panasonic. Life is better in living color.

A remembered jolt. Was that what messed up her hearing? He back-handed her on her ear and she tripped over the door to a half-buried oven. Fucking or punching. All the same hurt. At first, she tried to stay upright and hold her hands in front of her face but soon, she gave up and curled on the ground like a grub, forcing him to pick her up and hold her to hit her. She'd had Survival Training where she learned to roll up in a ball and to protect her neck in case of a bear attack. A bear would have been preferable to Jed, high on Ecstasy and amphetamines that gave his punching arm the stamina and repetitive blows of an Energizer Punch Bunny.

She walked on and on but after a while, it didn't seem that she was getting anywhere. The road was a treadmill passing the same thing. Black triangular trees with white overloaded branches. Monotonous in their sameness. Occasionally, a whumpf of snow would jolt her out of her lethargy. The snowy load would get too heavy and when gravity took over, the crash to the ground set up a mini-snow-storm that made her jump.

The first time it happened, she felt a leap of fear. Had Jed come back to finish it? Soon, though, as it happened multiple times, even a snow dump that dusted her head and shoulders with chunks of ice snow barely got her to turn her head.

She had no idea how far or how long she'd been walking since Frankie shoved his boots at her and told her to keep going. Time had lost all meaning. It was beginning to feel pointless to put one foot in front of the other. Her hands had lost all feeling. She couldn't feel her nose or her lips. Even her thoughts seemed to be numbing and slowing like the cold outside was working its way inside her body.

She was thinking of all the delicate and wildly diverse plants of the high country that were now buried under snow. In the brutally short growing season---heightened by the pressure of high elevation, extreme winds, and cold, the plants shot up in a frenzy of fragile revolt. Indian paintbrush, lupine, shooting stars, glacier lilies, avalanche lilies mouse-on-a-stick, mats of clover, heart leaf arnica, purple asters, bear grass, popcorn plants, spreading phlox, red and pink and white heather, gillia gentian, monks hood, camas with its deadly bulbs. If she could keep listing all the flowers and plants she had drawn, she could keep placing one foot in front of her. Thimble berry, salmon berry, wild strawberries, alpine raspberry, choke cherry, bitter brush, lady fern, sword fern, maiden hair ferns and deer fern.

The names were stored somewhere deep in her brain. The locked drawer that held them must have been shaken loose by Jed's beating. Now that the punching and sex was over, she had the feeling that there was so little left of her, she wasn't even sure she was still the same person. The plant list kept her feet on the never-ending ribbon of road that stretched on with no end.

Every plant had a creative strategy for surviving their harsh and unforgiving world. Some shot their stalks up high and fast toward the brief face of the son. Others spread low and sucked the nutrients out of rocks and scrags and scree. The heathers fought each other for narrow ecological niches: red heather had larger, low-to-the-ground foliage and more red-pink blooms than its competitor, white heather which was closer-to-the-ground, more slender with fewer creamy white bells.

She knew where the sketch book was, even with her shaken brain pan. It was wrapped at the bottom of her summer clothes trunk where she'd hid it after the fire at Healing House. Looking at the pages, she could barely remember the almost-15-year-old she had been, full of hope and usefulness that summer, face turned toward the light for the briefest time.

It was when she ran out of flower names that she let herself sink to her knees in the snow. It felt so good to stop walking. Nothing moved in the stillness. A faint rushing throb in the pines. The windy sound of rushing water in the creek that paralleled the road. A violin rub of a bare tree branch brushing a tree trunk made an other-worldly sound that was part human and part creature in pain.

She curled up on her side, bare knees tucked up to her chest in the zipped up jacket like she'd been foreshortened into a baby. The soft snow under her felt oddly warm in contrast to the deep blue cold she could feel creeping up from the frozen ground into her bones.

She was seeing glacier lilies, so vibrantly yellow and sunny during their short lives before they were buried under snow for the rest of the year. What color would she be when the dark night of winter came to an end? Whose face would she see looking down into her own when she opened her eyes to the sun?

> When Lydia's body would go no further, even though her mind was telling her to walk on, she swayed at the lip of the road. It seemed as if the snowy path had darkened as the moonlight dimmed. The road which had started out as bright as a highway, fell to darkness on both sides. The road forward became only a pin prick of light like the stars winking out in the darkness above.
>
> Maybe a deer, an elk, something big and warm bodied like a moose, had sheltered in the well overnight. She felt drawn to the heat of its body. It was dark in the shelter of the pine but could it be warm away from the frozen road?
>
> In the well, she let herself sink to her knees. Her side rested against the caramel smelling tree bark. She would just rest there a moment. Catch some warmth from the just departed creature who had left its winter den.
>
> In a short while, her eyelids dipping down and then semi-widening awake, that she became a woodland creature as she let her body settle onto its side. And in time she wasn't a creature as sleep pressed its coffin lid over her, but a glacier lily that was dreaming of pushing its head above the ice crystals now embedded in her cheek. She was a white flower, then a yellow bloom, flaming bright against the pinpricked sky that could be sensed but not seen overhead. In the spring, she would rise out of this restful sleep and brighten the wilderness within a field of beauty.

He threw her boots into the ravine in two different directions.

"It's not that far to Post Falls," Jed said. "Just head for the highway. Down hill all the way."

"I thought you liked me."

"That was before."

Before? She was swaying. Something was wrong with her balance and she couldn't hear very well unless her right ear was aimed in the direction he was speaking.

"It ain't that cold tonight," Jed said. "Besides you'll warm up if you start running."

She could barely walk. Everything below her waist was on fire and she was strangely listing, though she was telling herself to stand up straight.

The night was bright with a full moon. Her naked skin on her lower half looked white except for dark streaking on the inside of one leg.

Frankie was driving when they left in a cloud of exhaust. Jed was too tired and Frankie better not fuck up his truck any more than he already had or he'd whale the shit out of him. "Good Night Lucille" was playing on the radio and Jed was singing along.

Could she walk two miles without shoes in the dark? Her feet were numb as flocks and the wonky balance thing seemed to get worse as she tried to navigate downhill. She consciously aimed for the inner side of the roadway. A line of sharp black Ponderosas lined the upslope while the edge closest to the ravine fell off into thin air. She lurched along, trying to concentrate on keeping moving. She was still here, she told herself. She could see her hands in front of her. One yellow zip tie had been pulled tight on her wrist and it was cutting off the circulation on her fingers or maybe that was the cold. Still here. Keep walking.

Jed made Frankie O strip her from the waist down but he left her in her socks. They tossed her Ferragamo boots and her jeans into the gully. The socks weren't a lot of protection from the cold but at least the snow was soft and the ruts from the truck hadn't frozen over. All she had to do was follow the tire tracks and keep walking. She could see her feet moving, one foot in front of her.

They'd left the zip ties in place so her arms were pulled tight behind her back. The biggest danger, she realized early on, was falling because she had nothing to help her pull herself up to her feet except years of ballet training in her core. Luckily, the first time she fell, she went down next to a rock and managed to get one shoulder on it for leverage until she could host herself straining and swaying back to standing.

After that, she kept her eyes trained on her feet to convince herself they were under here. It was either keep going or fall down for good.

She was done with that. The only one who was going to erase herself was herself. As long as she was upright, she knew she was still here.

"We ought make the bitch walk home," Jed told Frankie. "That'll teach her to fuck with me ." He wandered over to the boots that they had dropped in the clearing when they wrestled her jeans off her and tossed them in her direction. She caught one in the chest but the other one sailed over her shoulder and disappeared in the ravine behind her. "Whoops," he said. "Good thing you still got your socks."

Jed made Frankie drive because he was too wasted and then, while the engine was running, Frankie O came back to her and got her to her feet. "Just keep going down," he said, his ferrety face pale in the moonlight. "You can't miss it. It's just a coupla miles."

Frankie O keep looking at at her like he wanted to say something. Finally, he shrugged out of his brown down jacket and shoved it at her. "You'll be safer here than with us," he said.

"What's O for?" she mumbled, her jaw clicking. She wondered if it had been dislocated.

"What?"

"O. O for what?"

"O for awful," he said.

Nothing made sense that night. O for awful was the least of it. She'd walked down hill for a while, stumbling and listing along, thinking he must have meant offal.Was that supposed to be a joke? Then like a ray of starlight breaking through a cloud, she realized he must have said "Orville." She remembered him saying over and over, "Keep walking. Don't lay down," like a parrot.

At some point that she realized all she had to do was lie still and survive. They were so high and drunk, sex with Jed too maybe two minutes and it took Frankie O less than a minute. She wondered if it was his first time because he spurted in his hand before he had it half way in. Jed kept knocking the shit out of her, punching and kicking her with his cowboy boots, then he tried to force Frankie O into fucking her in a two way. Frankie couldn't keep his dick up and then Jed punched on him for a while while she lay face down, bare assed in the snow, and shivering.

About the time Jed starting waving a Bowie knife around and talking about the best way to carve up her face, Frankie O produced a tab of Ecstasy from his pocket. "Hey, lookee here. Been saving this up for an emergency."

After that, they left her crumpled among the beer cans and bottles and broken glass.

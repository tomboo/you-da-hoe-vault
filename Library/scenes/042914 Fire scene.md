4/29/14 Fire Scene Everybody Out

What happens in the fire scene? The smokes sets off the fire alarm and everybody gets rousted out of bed and they run out, half clad, into a cold and starry night when the sky is clear and if feels like the temperature has cracked the mercury.

Charlene herds everybody out and grabs up an armful of coats and the other night duty in the boys wings strips a couple beds of blankets and flannel sheets and passes out the bedding to augment the ragtag ski coats and jackets that people have put on over pajamas or night gowns or in Rachel\'s case an oversize tee shirt that says [Wiseman CheeseHead]{.underline}. The fire truck has driven up on the lawn and is angled against the Ponderosa pines that line the yard and the yard is a beehive of men in neon-ringed overalls and safety taped jackets and hardhats--kind of controlled chaos with hoses snaking from the truck and ladders mounted to the walls and a couple of guys up on the roof chopping a hole in the roof over the girls wing.

The sight was illogical and strange and wonderment seemed to be catching as it hopped from the stranded kids in their mismatched boots and blankets, to the firemen in their neon-striped coats that matched the neon glow of the raccoons.

\"So Margaret\'s aim was better than she thought,\" was Rachel\'s conclusion. The raccoons were splattered with paint spray where the canisters had exploded against their bellies and haunches. On one painted ran from its shoulder down its forearm to a tiny, almost human starfish of a hand.

08112025 BookTok Jumping Up and Down for Attention

Set up: Cynthia behind a fairly tall wall that she is trying to jump up and wave and shout to get attention.

Or Cynthia behind a group of people who are all reading and she's jumping up and down behind them trying to get them to notice

Relative of the idea: Fitbit levitating below the level of the table (could do a version with the Fitbit gag and Cynthia's VO)

It's the movement: the split-second "there-not there" visual that makes it funny when someone is trying very hard to be seen when someone else is going about their business. Since writers are word people, so when the reading audience sees one who understands visual ideas, we stand out.

---I could read a very visual scene to demo how word people (writers) need to up their game in a very visual socially-driven world

---or write a VO about using visuals to stand out by doing something different.

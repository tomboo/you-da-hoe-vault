073015 What Margaret is doing on night of raccoons

Margaret's sing-along to "Put Your Hands Up" had a whole new meaning when applied to Dr August Aloyius Hazey.

Margaret was in her flannel sheets next to Hank after a successful bout of lovemaking that involved Margaret gingerly clambering on top after stuffing two sofa pillows under Hank's knees but was, for all that, glorious and life affirming all the same. After a thunderous orgasm Hank dropped off as if he'd been poleaxed and Margaret, energized from her matching orgasm, couldn't sleep.

Margaret was still awake after midnight.

She and Hank had just finished their first successful bout of lovemaking in more than six months. It involved two sofa pillows under his knees and Margaret had to clamber gingerly on top so she didn't hurt his spine but Lordy May, the stars shivering in the heavens when her orgasm hit her. Man, she had needed it.

Hank fell into a happy coma as if he'd been poleaxed. Margaret tried to go back to sleep but she couldn't stop thinking about how she was going to confront Dr. Hazey with her knowledge of his drug habit.

It had been a long time coming but at last, Dr. Hazey was going to do right by Margaret and put her in charge of his newest residence, the one he'd just taken a new loan from US Bank to finance.

She padded out to the kitchen and made herself a cup of cocoa. She snapped on the tiny transistor radio on the kitchen table that Hank used to listen to the Farm Report.

Macklemore's tinny treble lit up her well worn kitchen and while she contemplated the well worn linoleum, bare in spots, and listened to the chugging of the refrigerator motor which was on its last legs, she thought about the healthy raise she intended to negotiate out of the good doctor.

Besides a raise and full medical benefits, she was looking forward to a new title.

Queen Margaret?

Chatelaine Margaret?

Macklemore sang, Tonight is the night. This is the moment. Then a blaze of inspiration almost took her breath away.

Put your hands up! Dr. Hazey. Margaret o'Dougherty, Residence Manager and Head Nutritionist, was putting Gretchen Beener on notice for armed burglary of the taste buds. No more smoking on the job!

No way she'd throw Old Girl to the wolves. She'd make him move Gretchen over to his newest residence so she could ride herd on her charges at Healing House. In addition to a big raise and full medical benefits, she needed a new title. And business cards.

Queen Margaret?

Master Negotiator, Margaret?

Chatelaine of the Manor and Lord of Dr. Hazey who owed her fealty and permanent employment for keeping her mouth shut.

Yes, indeedy. She and Dr. Hazer were going to have a productive and peaceful partnership.

Though she didn't know it, Margaret went back to bed thinking about what her new business cards would look like about the same time the firemen judged Healing House safe and they let the kids in out of the cold. Hank felt warm and comforting, if a little damp, when she climbed in next to him.

Margaret O'Dougherty, Healing House Manager and Head Nutritionist had a nice ring to it.

Too much? Not nearly enough.

Margaret was uncharacteristically still awake at that moment.

She and Hank had just finished their first successful lovemaking in over six months. It involved stuffing two sofa pillows under his knees and Margaret had to clamber very gingerly on top so she didn't put too much pressure on his lower spine but Lordy May, the stars shivered in the heavens when her orgasm hit her. Man, had she missed this.

Hank fell into a happy coma while Margaret was so stirred up, she couldn't sleep. She was too busy counting her blessings that started with the big O and proceeded through the big raise and full heal benefits Dr. Hazey was going to give her as soon as she confronted him with her knowledge of his drug habit.

It had been a long time coming. At last, Dr. Hazey was going to be incentivized i.e. terrorized to do right by Margaret. She intended to be put in charge of his newest residence, the one he'd just taken a loan from US Bank to finance, in exchange for her silence.

She padded out to the kitchen to make a cup of cocoa and snapped on the tinny transistor that Hank used to listen to the farm report every morning. Macklemore's voice lit up her well-worn kitchen with the worn through linoleum and the ailing refrigerator motor she would replace first thing with her raise. "Put your hands up!" Macklemore's anthem had a whole new meaning when it was aimed at Dr. Hazey.

She chuckled as she hummed along to Macklemore. "Put your hands up! Tonight is the moment!" Macklemore's words had a whole new and wonderful meaning when they were aimed at Dr. Hazey. Besides a nice raise and full medical benefits, her new responsibilities as manager of Inner Horizon's newest residence would include a new title. Queen Margaret? Czar Margaret? What did Hazey's business card say? President and Founder. Actually, Margaret O'Dougherty, Residence Manager and Head Nutritionist, sounded pretty good.

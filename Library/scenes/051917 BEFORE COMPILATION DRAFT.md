051917 BEFORE COMPILATION DRAFT

BEFORE

6\.

PRADA PURSE. CHECK. FERRAGAMO BOOTS. Check. Desire the One perfume. Check. Lydia went through the stuff she had with her one by one. Rag & Bone jeans. Milly blouse. Extra-large bottle of Listerine.

Empty. Empty. Empty. All Lydia could think after meeting with her mother was how much she wanted to stuff her face. Size 2. Size 2. She'd been a Size 2 since she was a twelve-year-old over and if she repeated it enough, maybe it would stop her from going in to the Dunkin\' Donuts store on the corner of Desiree' Street, four blocks away from Northern Idaho Community College. She was supposed to be in World History class.

At the counter, multi-colored sprinkles and rich dark chocolate frosting and cinnamon sugar on cake donuts promised fullness.

She took the pink box with 13 donuts from the nice Mennonite waitress ---"13 is for luck and Lydia!" the girl said, surprising Lydia by knowing her name. Shit. Had she been to Dunkin' Donuts so often they recognized her? She went behind the store to the narrow space between two reeking blue dumpsters. If she pulled her knees up, her boot tips didn\'t show and she felt invisible. Out of sight, out of mind, she thought as she ate three cake donuts dipped in cinnamon sugar first, then the powdered sugar ones; then she started in on the chocolate frosted glazed donuts and stuffed them down quickly, barely chewing. From years of experience she knew she had to bolt them down as fast as she could before the gluey mass formed in her stomach and kept her from finishing the box. She got through all twelve before lucky Number 13 started her gag reflex, helped along by a practiced finger at the back of her throat.

Not wanting to mess up her boots, she had to hold the heavy dumpster lid up over her head and because she was short---what her Jewish grandfather called petite, but he was only 5 foot-six, so what did he know? ----it was hard to get her lips up and past the edge of rusted metal. Twice she had to lower the lid and rest her forehead against the cold, blue side of the bin. Back to work, she\'d think, every time she raised the lid and tried to stand on her tiptoes to hurl her own foulness above the reek. When she got lightheaded and dizzy, she finally gave up on trying to protect her Ferragamos. She went back to the cozy, half-hidden place between the dumpsters and retched out the whole foul baker's dozen in a fiesta of pink and green-flecked confetti and half-masticated dough.

It took maybe 30 minutes for her to finally feel empty and clean as a bell.

She took a packet of baby wipes out of the Prada and wiped the flecks of candied sprinkles and chocolate goo and spit off her toes. A half-dozen gargles of Listerine. One last cleansing spit.

The size 2-waist of the Rag & Bone jeans gapped nicely. Fuck James, she thought, deciding to torment him by giving Reza a hand job in the back of the van.

A heavily cut red haired guy in a muscle shirt parked himself next to her at a cafeteria table. She got up and went to the Lady\'s Room and cleaned her boots with damp paper towels. Then, because she was always thirsty after throwing up, she clawed in the bottom of her purse for enough change to buy a cup of coffee. Between the pale nail polish she'd bought to get rid of the Goth look and the doughnuts, she was irked to find that she came up short.

Muscle-boy with the rust-colored beard was still hunched at the same table. He was counting out and stacking small towers of pennies, dimes, and nickles. He looked up when she stopped at his side.

"I'll trade you a quickie for a cup of coffee," she said.

"What?" A broad freckled face looked blank. For a nanosecond, she wondered if he was fucking with her.

"You and me?" she said, gesturing over her shoulder toward the janitorial closet. "I know a place where no one will see us."

"Do I know you?"

"No, but but that's easy to fix."

His pale blue eyes looked polite but distrustful. "I'm sorry. I don't do that." He sounded like he was politely turning down another helping at dinner. Sorry Ma'am. Just full up.

"Aren't you into free sex?"

"I'm, ah, not \--." He cleared his throat. "I'm Mormon. I'm saving myself for my virgin wife."

The expression "virgin wife" was so odd that Lydia found herself stifling a laugh. What the hell was a "virgin" wife? A gaggle of slutty-looking NICC cheerleaders in short skirts that stretched over thighs the size of ham hocks were yukking it up a few tables over. One was applying lipstick and making obscene kissy faces at the hatchet-faced Indian jock next to her. Not a virgin in sight, as far as Lydia could see.

"Don't you like it?" she asked.

"I don't know." He seemed to wince at the use of the word sex in conversation. "I've never done it."

"Just how old are you?"

"Nineteen. I'll be twenty in March."

Lydia's experience with men and boys was wide and deep. This was a first for her. A 19-year-old male virgin who had just turned down sex the way you'd turn down a serving of Brussels sprouts. Her second turn down of the day. James Olson and now this guy. Was she losing her touch?

The coffee cup steamed between them on the table top. "Go ahead. You should drink it while it's hot. I don't want it that much."

She could see his naked longing for caffeine in his hesitation. She wondered if she had a similar longing on her face when she'd blurted out, "Would you like a quickie?" If she had, clown-boy certainly wasn't buying what she was selling.

She nudged the cup towards him. "Seriously. At least one of us should get what we want."

At the first swallow of caffeine, his hang-dog expression was replaced by bliss. "Oh man," he said. "you have no idea how much I needed this."

Her hollow stomach gave a low gurgle and she tasted a faint but definite taste of bile. Oh, I think I do.

It turned out his name was Lorenzo. A Mormon from Hillsdale, a small town in Southern Utah. His stepdad had dumped him at a bus station in Salt Lake City with \$75 in cash and a warning to not come back to Hillsdale, if he knew what was good for him.

"So now you're going to school here?" Lydia gestured at the NICC students around them who were eating or cramming or shooting the shit with their friends.

"No," he said. "I just interviewed for a job in the kitchen here as a short order cook." He shrugged. "I didn't get it. They only hire work-study kids."

Lydia had never heard of work-study. The girl's school in Lausanne taught things like deportment and conversational etiquette and how to plan an eight-course meal with special emphasis on presentation and flower arrangement.

His eyes had lit up when she set the steaming cup in front of him. But now his expression was guarded. Or was it disgust? Not exactly the reaction Lydia was used to getting when she offered sex to a 19-year-old boy.

"You're not gay, are you?" She backtracked in her mind to see if she'd missed something obvious about the big and freckly man-boy. A fluttery wrist? A hip-swinging gait? Any of the small myriad ways gay men advertised what they were looking for. He sat stolid and monumental as a lumberjack or a fisherman in worn Carrhardt pants and an open plaid flannel shirt with a collarless Henley-style thermal shirt faintly pockmarked with dimples. He certainly didn't look like a metrosexual, not that they were thick on the ground in Idaho, nor a typical Stetson-and-Lee-jeans cowhand, who were.

"It's OK if you are, of course," she said hurriedly, lest he think she was prejudiced. "My best friend in Detroit is gay. I just thought you looked lonely."

The side of his wide mouth quirked up. "Well, you're right about that. You just---well, you took my by surprise. I'm not used to girls like you being friendly."

"What do you mean by 'girls like me?' Do you mean because I asked you to have sex or because I offered you a cup of coffee?"

"No, no." He spread massive freckled hands the size of baseball mitts out in a sweeping gesture. "It's just---sex is forbidden until marriage in the Mormon church." This sounded like a pronouncement that the earth was flat or the sun revolved around the earth. It was the way the world was, with no questions asked.

"I've been having sex since I was 14," Lydia volunteered.

"Are you married?"

What an odd question. She felt like she was having a conversation with an alien who didn't know the first thing about the natives.

"You're just jerking my chain, aren't you?" she said. "Everybody knows what a quickie is."

"I beg your pardon," he said. "I do know what they are but it's not anything I've ever done."

"Oh, you're gay. Aren't you?" She hurriedly backtracked so as not to offend. "I mean, that's fine. Perfectly OK with me. Your choice and all that." She realized she was grinning inanely and she'd never felt more uncomfortable in her life.

"I'm not gay. That's a mortal sin to a Mormon."

"Oh?"

"It's just -- we don't believe in sex outside marriage."

"That's..." Unusual? Different? She searched her vocabulary for any word that wasn't ridiculous.

For a brief instant, she realized they were both looking at each other in the manner of two people confronted by a wild animal at the door.

"Don't\--!"

"Maybe\--!"

They both spoke over each other in an attempt to find a common bone to throw in the direction of the threat.

Lydia was killing time at the Student Union building till Sociology 101 when a heavily cut red haired guy in a muscle shirt parked himself at the cafeteria table across from her. She had been fantasizing about having sex with his faceless body until he turned to one side and revealed a farmer's beard that made his face look like a shovel.

It was perfectly clear to Lydia why she wanted to have sex with this new guy she didn't know at the Student Union, and Mr. Timms, the World History teacher with the pony keg of a paunch, and anyone else she might run into that day. Sex felt great during. It was just the after that didn't always feel so great.

She'd have wet stuff running down the inside of her leg and there was always that awkward moment before she could get her jeans on and re-zipped when two people who had just been intimate couldn't meet each others eyes. The guy was always saying it was mind blowing or it rocked his world or something equally lame but she could feel him drifting away from her before he got his shirt tucked into his pants. He'd run off with his buttons off kilter (James) or forget his jacket (Mr. Timms) or leave his shoe laces untied (the guy at the Circle K who handed her a Coke and said, "Bottoms up.") It was much more rewarding to think of the before when James or Mr. Timms or Randy---it took a minute to raise the name of the guy from the Circle K---when whoever it was would be burning with anticipation, a light sheen of sweat salting their neck, sperm cells marshaling to explode in a big hot whoosh.

Once the guy she used to fuck weekly in his pig truck flipped her a pack of condoms and said, "Here. Don't say I never gave you anything." What the hell was his name? She threw his stupid Trojan Featherlights in the trash. Not her brand. If she couldn't remember his name now, what did that mean? She remembered the way he flipped the condoms at her. The way you'd flip a shitty waitress a quarter to show her what you thought of her sullen service. This was after she'd knocked herself out and had been rewarded by the loopy, blissed out expression on his stupid face. Why would someone you just wanted to be close make you feel you ought to be a million miles away?

Lydia had a thing about facial hair. Beards, goatees, van Dykes, especially long sideburns and any size mustache, were immediate deal-killers.

Mr. Shovel Face was big and curly haired, built like a football player but super-tall. Six-five? Six-six? Lydia preferred muscular boys with styled hair not a halo of rusty red curls with a clown's curly beard. He looked like a jack-in-the box puppet she had as a kid if not as evil. He didn't seem likely to fly up and smack her in the jaw, which is what happened on her first encounter with Jack the Whack.

Mr. Shovel Face took his sick python biceps and his big lats over to the phone booth. It cost 50 cents to place a local call and Lydia had exactly \$1.03 cents to her name. In the Program, money was the controlled substance. It was hella-easy to get Prozac or Klonapine or occasionally, Valium, but it took an act of God to get a measly ten bucks. Maybe when Shovel Head gave up the dinosaur phone---Lydia wasn't actually sure she knew how to use one--she could talk him out of a couple quarters so she could call somebody in World History to borrow the notes from the class she missed.

Not having an I-phone was the tragedy of her life.

When the Inner Horizons staff packed her cell phone away, along with her new Apple Air laptop and her Bose mini-speakers and her Bluetooth headset, it felt like someone had ripped out her larynx. Her therapist, Darlene, told her that unplugging was good for her. It removed the crutch of superficial connections. "Pseudo connections", Darlene called them. But what if pseudo connections were all she could handle? Howzit going, 'sup? LOL, OMG. Texting with Mom was bad enough though nothing like the minefield of actually speaking to her.

Mr. Shovel Head was gesturing vehemently in the phone booth like somebody on the other end of the line didn't get it. Mom didn't get it either which is why Lydia and her mother had adopting texting as their main mode of communication. If the cut guy would text instead of talk, he could have controlled the conversation and steered it out of the bad space between them. Even Mom loved texting; she loved to tell anyone who would listen that texting was infinitely easier than talking to a nutcase teenager.

Really, though, Mom was the wack-job; she acted younger, even more out of control than Lydia. The day Grandpa Ben put her on a plane to Idaho, Mom drove out to their Grosse Pointe Shores Tudor to say goodbye. She was in her new red Corvette with a 22-year-old at the wheel. Lydia knew the driver, Jason Horvath. He was the year ahead of her in grade school. How embarrassing was that? Mom, in tight Lulu Lemon pants, a lacy red bra hanging out of her camisole, glued to Jason's arm like she needed him to stand up. For being 46, Mom looked pretty hot (all the beauty money and a good cosmetic surgeon could buy, she liked to say). Plus she lived on rice cakes and nonfat-yogurt which meant she was starved enough to take down a deer. The last thing she had said to Lydia was, \"I hope you grow up in Idaho. You should be at least twelve by the next time I see you.\" If Mom were supposed to be only a year older than Lydia, how the hell would she know when her daughter outgrew her?

Shovel Face was counting out coins on the tabletop when she came back from the cafeteria with a cup of coffee. Methodically separating quarters from dimes and nickels.

\"What are you doing?\" she asked, coming up to the table to stand next to him.

He looked around to locate who was talking to him. When he saw her, he stopped. "Counting my money."

\"I see that. Why?\"

He blinked lake blue eyes. \"To see if I have enough for a cup of coffee.\"

\"Do you?\"

\"No.\"

Lydia didn\'t know what possessed her but she set her untouched coffee next to the neat piles of coins.

\"I haven\'t touched it,\" she said. "Go ahead."

The big man-boy rocked back in his chair. He was younger than she thought. He wore a flannel mountain man shirt with a tear in the elbow and a waffle weave undershirt. Not exactly Abercrombie and Fitch. He seemed to hesitate, but then she smiled and he let the legs of the chair settle forward. He said, \"God, I need this," and grabbed the cup.

They both laughed.

She sat down.

His name was Lorenzo.

OLD GIRL BLEW IN TO HER THURSDAY SESSION with Dr. Hazey dressed in her usual black Goth-punk-psycho garb. Hazey himself was hazy on when she started wearing all black as a uniform.

When she came to the Program as a 15-year-old adolescent, she remembered her wearing normal kid clothes. Oversize tee shirts with messages like "Eat Me" or "I'd Rather Be a Dick than a Dave." Now her ginger-colored dreadlocks were caught up at the top of her head with a black shoelace. It looked like she'd sprouted a shock of carrots on the top of her head. She could hide behind all that black--- the expression on her face today matched her outfit---but she couldn't hide the fact that life was bursting out all over her.

She paced before the picture window in his office that looked out on the frozen lake. It was rare for Lake Coeur D'Alene to freeze over but when it did, it looked like the world's biggest parking lot.

"Bad day?" Hazy said to her back.

"Fucking horrible," she said. "I want to go back to Adolescents."

You and every old person in this world, Hazey thought, remembering the hope in his life when he was Old Girl's age and lit up like a Roman candle

with hormones.

"You're 18. Over the line." Haley's patented shrug, developed over long hours with every pathology in the DSM, conveyed how sorry he was. If it was up to him...

"Bull shit. You're the director. You founded this shit hole. You could put me back where I belong away from all these idiots."

One of Old Girl's problems was that she was too smart. You couldn't pull the wool over her eyes.

"You've only been in Young Adults a month. What's the problem?"

"They're all adolescents."

For a second, he thought she was joking but then he realized she was serious. He laughed anyway. "Did you hear yourself? What you just said?"

She sank into the corner of the love seat which put her small body directly under the photo of three farmers on their way to a dance. He hadn't noticed it before she almost looked one of the young men. Same black pants, same black fitted jacket, a natty wool fedora-like hat she'd set next to her as if she wanted to be save its knife-creases. The only thing missing from the farmer's ensemble was a homemade walking stick.

"You think it's funny that I'm asking to go back to Adolescents when I'm complaining about living with a bunch of babies?" Her delicate, lightly freckled face reflected on this idea for moment, then bloomed with a sudden grin. "That is kind of humorous."

"What's the real problem?"

"I hate having a roommate."

She'd had a single in Adolescents where they got fewer patients. It was the teenage years when every kid in America went nuts, so all the YAs had to double up at Healing House.

"You don't like Rachel Interlachen? She's the one who got assigned to your double?"

Hazey thumbed through a stack of reports and pulled out a weekly status report on Rachel Interlachen, written by Rosa Musselman, her therapist. "Says here Rachel is a model citizen. Polite. Unassuming. Helpful. Considerate."

"Are you sure you're not reading the Girl Scout manual?"

Hazey returned her gaze. Let silence do his work.

"She wants to be friends."

Ah, the real thing.

"I want my single back."

"We had more room in Adolescents. Everybody bunks in twos in Young Adults."

"Could you at least put me in with somebody who's not a Pollyanna?"

"What's a Pollyanna?"

"Somebody who always looks on the bright side. It makes me want to slap her."

Hazey was thinking about the walking sticks. How he'd like to borrow one from the farmers and beat some will to live back into Old Girl with it.

He wished he could say, you have your whole life to live! You're smart. You're funny. Sure, you've experienced cataclysmic tragedy and had the bad luck to lose both your parents and your brother, but you're alive. Take a step toward something! Anything! Connect with one of the kids, boy or girl."

Contrary to the rules of his own program that he had set, Hazey was sex-agnostic. Except for the legal nightmare, he personally thought that more sex not less for some of his hormonally raging patients, the majority of whom had grown up without enough love or security, might even help. Try it, Old Girl. Let yourself be young for once! Instead, he wanted to say. Instead, he said, "Wouldn't it be less lonely if you let her be friends with you?"

Old Girl stared out at the ice that stretched toward an ever-diminishing patch of dark open water, as if she'd walk right out to its blackness if he opened the door. The walking stick could also be used as a crutch or something to cling to, if she would just reach for it and hang on. Maybe he should give her a goddamn stick so she could use it as both.

"Where's your humanity? Can't you think of somebody beside yourself? Rachel needs a friend. She's all alone, first week away from her family and friends. Strange place. Strange rules. Strange people. What if it's not about what you need and it's really about what she needs?"

Old Girl was still pretending to focus on the lake but Hazey could see by the alert tilt of her head that she was listening. He pressed on. "Just listen to her," he said. "Put yourself in her shoes and ask yourself what she needs."

Old Girl was already scooping up the black fedora and jamming it over her carrot sprouts so it covered her ears. "You're the Pollyanna," she said. "How'd I get such bad luck to get saddled with two of you?"

She slammed the door like the adolescent she still was.

Haley contemplated the natty farmers in their best black clothing, forever waiting politely for the picture to be finished so they could go on to their fun. Maybe he was the one who needed the walking stick. He could use it to beat the hope out of himself that he was actually doing something to help lift Old Girl out of her depression.

IF RACHEL HURRIED, SHE COULD meet with Dr. Lengel and pick up another copy of *Huck Finn* at the bookstore before she had to meet the pick-up van. Somebody had stolen her*s*.

A steady slippage of deodorants and shampoo and pieces of clothing had been going MIA with the regularity of a metronome at Healing House. Rachel had wanted to wear her cashmere sweater that morning, a birthday present from Gran. It was one of the few times the old woman had given her a present that she could actually use. Gran, a snappy seventy-year-old with the energy of a coiled spring, haunted garage sales (her idea of entertainment) and was always giving Rachel an endless series of antique teacups. All with a story of their maker and age and how valuable they were. Gran knew because "she looked it up in the book," an ancient dog-eared Bible of antique china that she always carried with her in an enormous alligator purse, another garage sale find.

*Miss Lucy had a baby. His name was Tiny Tim.*

*She put him in the bathtub. To see if he could swim.*

*He drank up all the water. He ate up all the soap.*

*He tried to eat the bathtub, But it wouldn\'t go down his throat.*

*Miss Lucy called the doctor. Miss Lucy called the nurse.*

*Miss Lucy called the lady With the alligator purse.*

Gran's old tote was big enough to stick Tiny Tim and the bathtub in it. That's what had happened after Rachel gave birth. A nurse had laid the tiny red wrinkly boy on her chest after 28 hours of hard labor and she dozed off feeling his scrawny bird weight and when she opened her eyes, he had flown.

Could you *lose* a baby? Apparently. Technically, Gran and Mom spirited him away from Rachel "for her own good" because she was only 16 and "couldn't take care of him." She always thought of the tiny boy as lost, as in "I've misplaced him" which gave her the feeling that if ever a miracle happened, he could be found again.

Originally they had agreed to let her keep him. That's what Rachel and Randy, her boyfriend, wanted. But Dad and Gran and Mom all ganged up on her in her last month of pregnancy.

"You're too young."

> "Randy's not committed."
>
> "Neither of you are ready for the responsibility."
>
> "It'll ruin your life before it's even started."

They were right about that part. St. Edwards High tossed her out because the Catholics didn't want a bad apple becoming a watermelon in their midst. Randy got cold feet brought on by a baseball scholarship to the University of Texas.

Then they made her switch schools and all her friends disappeared. At the alternative school they made her attend, she walked around alone morphing into a heftier and heavier ghost.

Everybody---her brother, all her aunts and uncles, the extended family of cousins stopped talking to her as if pregnancy was some kind of plague. Then, as if all that was only a preamble to hell, Gran and Mom sat her down in the last month of her pregnancy to tell her they wouldn't lift a finger to help her if she kept him. Out on the street at sixteen with no job skills, no degree, and no money to buy diapers or baby food. You'll both starve, they said.

There were worse things than starving, Rachel found out. After having the baby, she went down a rabbit hole but unlike Alice, she never came out of it. All she did was tumble farther, faster, deeper into darkness. The only thing that brought her toward the light where she could feel something \--and that was merely temporary -- was cutting.

*\"Mumps, said the doctor. Measles, said the nurse.*

*Razor, said the lady With the alligator purse.*

For months, she brought back the birth pangs by slicing her armpits and the bottoms of

her feet and the insides of her thighs with a salted razor. Until one day, a month ago, she couldn't stop and she opened the arteries of both wrists down to bone.

Welcome to Healing House.

*Out went the doctor. Out went the nurse.*

*Out went the lady With the alligator purse.*

SIX DEGREES. COLDER THAN A witches tit and more cold on the way. Rusty Harrow was thinking that if he got his route done early, he could strip the Buick he\'d bought off Nelson at the food store and see if he could get some cash for the parts from the Buick dealer. Pete Petty, who ran the service department, didn\'t mind subbing used parts when people were being charged for new. Petty paid pretty good for whatever Rusty brought him and he paid in cash.

Rusty was moving fast at Dr. Hazey's, rolling a garbage can on its end, dragging it to the truck bed, grunting when he lifted the overfilled can and dumped it in the truck bed. Sometimes he wished he had a lift, like the town garbage hauler pansies that didn't have to do shit but heft a can onto a lip and let the hydraulics do it for you.

He took off a glove to wipe the sweat out of his eyes.

Fucking pansies. Too lazy to hick the big metal cans over their heads when Rusty Harrow did it all goddamn day. Neck ached today. He couldn't remember. Maybe he slept on it funny. Couldn't remember if he slept at all, now that he thought about it. All he remembered was rousing in his trailer at the dump and thinking the moon looked like a big white ass.

The last of the loony bin was parked over by the fence. Tipped over on its side. Fucking raccoons, he thought. Possibly coyotes. Chicken bones and clumps of a turkey carcass had been dragged away from tin cans and crumpled newspapers and coffee grounds. He scooped methodically pushing the crap on the ground back into a can chanting, \" "Cocksucker, sucking cocksucker," like a jingle under his breath.

He was trying to decide between a donut stop downtown or a cinnamon roll as big as his head at the Truck Stop on I-90 when he heard the sound of puking.

He peered around the corner. The sky was changing from night blue to a girly pink. He couldn\'t believe his eyes. A blond girl, with long, honey-colored hair was bent over puking. Her back to him, one hand held back a loose ponytail from her face. Legs all the way to heaven rose up to the pink globes of a perfect ass. Striped bikini panties settled into a dark and beckoning vee at her crotch like a street arrow.

A shimmying movement under the cotton tee shirt, a mysterious jiggle of independent flesh rippled and swayed. The skin on her arms and legs mottled with gooseberries.

She vomited and vomited bent over at the waist, then stood up to wipe her face with hand. She brushed her long whiskey and hay colored hair away from her mouth, then started to pick her way towards him, along the side of the building. Her shirt said, "Liquor Up Front."

Rusty ducked around the corner and waited to see where she was going while he imagined what the line of bare flesh running from the bottom of the white tee shirt to her feet would look like if she sat next to him in the cab of his truck. He\'d never had a woman in the truck. Certainly never one with a half bare ass that put Hustler magazine to shame. She tiptoed past him as if she was trying to keep her heels off the snow.

Catching sight of him on the driver's side of the truck, she muttered something that sounded like you're sick. You're a dick? He couldn\'t make out the words. All he could hear was a roar in his ears. His hard on was sharp enough to split wood.

She hurried past him up the front steps and pounded on the front door. Her bare ass cheeks were white below a Stockman's Bar tee shirt that read "Poker in the Rear." When fatso Charlene Hightman opened the front door, all the air whooshed out of him.

Oh my God, she wants me.

LYDIA LEFT THE ALLEY BEHIND Dunkin' Donuts and she stopped at the corner to decide whether to kill time by shopping at the shitty low-end shops in downtown Coeur d\'Alene or walk back to campus.

Across the street, she saw a big red haired man leaving the Povarello Center wearing a big back pack with a steel frame. He looked like a mountain man off to the back woods until he bent to untie a wolf-size dog from a parking meter and she realized it was Lorenzo.

\"What are you doing here?\" she called across the traffic.

He crossed over when there was a break in the cars, the dog trotting like a sentry behind him. \"I live here.\"

\"Isn\'t that a homeless center?\"

He shrugged. \"I told you I got thrown out. It beats sleeping on the sidewalk." Lydia automatically reached for her wallet. She was so used to having money she forgot for a moment that her checkbook and her credit cards and a pile of cash had been taken from her and locked up in the Inner Horizon safe. All she had in her wallet was \$3 in change.

\"What are you looking for?\" Lorenzo asked.

\"I was going to give you money for a hotel but I forgot they took away my credit cards.\"

\"I don\'t need a hotel. The Pov Center is great. They\'ve been letting Joseph Smith stay in the mud room.\"

"Who's Joseph Smith? And how come they won't give him a bed?"

Lorenzo laughed. "Because he's a dog, nimrod."

He made a hand gesture to Joseph Smith who sat down with a sigh at his feet. The dog looked like it had some German shepherd in it, with a mouth that turned up in a perpetual grin.

Lydia, who'd never been allowed a dog, held out her hand tentatively to let him smell her but he emitted a low grumbling sound, part warning, part question mark.

\"He\'s protective,\" Lorenzo said. \"Keeps me safe.\" He looked around at the dive bars on either side of the Poverello Center. \"It\'s not the best neighborhood. What are you doing here?\"

She wasn\'t about to tell him about the dumpster behind Dunkin' Donuts. She wondered if the sweet reak had followed her from the alley to the stoplight."\"I was going to do some shopping."

He looked skeptically at the Deja View lounge sign with a naked woman. "Here?"

"Window shopping isn't a crime," she said.

He picked up the rope that served as the wolf-dog\'s leash and said, "Sorry I can't talk to you longer. I can't be late for my job.\"

\"I didn\'t know you got a job."

One red wiry eyebrow lifted quizzically. \"You don\'t know much about being homeless, do you?\"

At the Deja View, a man in a business suit peered intently at the crotchless panty display in the window.

\"Work. Paycheck. Rent money? Get it?" Lorenzo said.

She held an empty Prada billfold in her hand which probably cost more than it cost to stay for a month at the Povarello Center.

\"See you in Sociology tomorrow?" Lorenzo whistled to the dog but turned back to hear her answer.

"Sure," she called. "But you didn't tell me where your job is."

\"McDonald's." He grinned. \"Ever heard of it?\"

\"You\'re mean."

\"That\'s because I'm the one who lives on the mean streets."

She walked back to campus without detouring to any of the shops on Main Street. What she wanted wasn\'t in any stupid Idaho cafe' or shop. It was serving hamburgers and French fries at the Arches.

Margaret leaned nonchalantly against the counter with her arms folded trying to keep her face neutral while Lydia ate ate three slices of apple and a monkey\'s nibble of cheese at the pace of a glacier.

Every day a new outfit. Today, it was shiny new Fry boots and never-worn jeans with a big seven embroidered on the back pocket. Why you'd advertise your size if you were larger than a seven wasn't something Margaret understood.

Some of the clothes in Lydia's closet still had the tags on them which did nothing to hide the Costco size box of Snickers bars stuffed in the back. For a kid who wasn\'t hungry, Lydia had enough sweets to put the world into a diabetic coma. Where she put all that crap in her elf-size frame was anybody\'s guess.

Still Margaret felt grimly sorry for her. All the money in the world, apparently, but not a single letter from home. In a place where kids lived for mail call, you might as well admit you were being raised by wolves.

Margaret had caught her dumping her breakfast in the trash when she thought nobody was looking. She wanted to say to the girl, \"What? So you think I was born yesterday?"She'd shake her if the treatment program didn't have strict rules about touching any of the participants. She\'d be hauled on her ass out her shitty non-benefits paying job in a flash if Dr. Hazy got wind ofanything that smacked of corporal punishment.

So Margaret concentrated on watching the girl chew. Lydia was skinny to the point of blowing away \-- a bulimic, which wasn't news to Margaret who had the pleasure of cleaning the regular flecks of vomit from all over the girls\' toilet. Gretchen always cut up and weighed every bite on Lydia\'s plate and wrote down every calorie they were trying to stuff into her so she wouldn\'t starve. The way Lydia was glaring at the cheese in her hand, Margaret expected the girl to toss it over her shoulder as soon as Margaret turned her back.

\"You need protein,\" Margaret tried for a conversational tone. \"Builds your bones and your teeth.\"

Lydia bared her orthodontia-perfect whites. \"My teeth are fine."

\"You don\'t want to go to Stabilization, do you? Eat up and I won\'t say anything. Seriously, I don\'t want to get you into trouble.\"

That was true but to be honest, Margaret didn\'t want to get herself in trouble more. She was already in Dutch for mouthing off to Gretchen, \"the registered dietician,\" as she was always reminding Margaret. They'd gone to high school together and Gretchen loved to bring up the fact that Margaret had gotten pregnant in their senior year and had to drop out. A sore subject after more than twenty years. Apparently the statute of limitations on shame never ran out.

\"One more slice,\" Margaret nodded at the girl's plate. \"And you can go catch the school shuttle.\"

The girl grabbed a giant Prada bag that probably cost as much as Margaret made in a month and shoved the apple slice into her mouth as she huffed out of the kitchen and slammed the door.

\"You have a nice day, too,\" Margaret said.

Outside the clank and rattle of garbage cans sounded over the hum of the departing van.

The kids who had passed their first three months in Intensive without violations were allowed to attend Northern Idaho Community College. The rest were doing some group therapy in the living room. The therapists called it Group but the kids, always on the lookout for name-calling, called it Grope. They called stick-up-her butt Gretchen, "Grinchen." They had a point. The woman couldn\'t cook her way out of a paper bag and she was mean to boot. How could you burn oatmeal and serve it with a straight face? That was what Lydia, the picky eater, had been dumping in the trash and really, how could you blame her? Margaret wouldn\'t eat Gretchen\'s cooking if they paid her and they certainly didn\'t.

Rusty Harrow\'s slope-shouldered simian form passed by the kitchen window. He had a garbage can strapped to his back and the lid was askew. aA trail of grapefruit rinds and coffee grounds followed him like garbage man was spewing out of his pores.

Margaret watched Rusty stop at a window of the girl\'s wing. He wasn't suspended with the empty garbage bin on his back and staring into one of the girl's rooms. Margaret felt a flutter of unease. What was he looking at so intently?

It was the room one closest to the laundry room next to the back door that was always kept locked. The lock was mostly to keep the kids in but Margaret supposed it was possible that it could keep bad things out. It wasn't something they worried about ten miles out of town.

Margaret stood at the sink, twashing pots and pans while Gretchen was supposedly doing meal planning at the table. It looked like Gretchen was researching ways to fuck up tomato soup.

Dr. Hazey, late for work as usual, was just pulling into the parking area in his brand new Lexus SUV as Rusty Harrow's old pig truck pulled out. The pig truck had a home-made stake bed made out of 2x4s that was doing a shitty job of holding the garbage cans in and it looked like Hazey was playing chicken with him.

At the last possible moment, Hazey stepped on the gas and used the ice under the tires to fishtail the SUV around the truck so he could land in the space next to the entrance that had his name on a placard. The therapist of the month was supposed to have the closest spot to Healing House but apparently the bloom was off that rose because Hazey parked squarely in the middle of both spots.

Rusty saluted like Hazey was his commanding officer and Dr. Hazey shot him a quizzical expression as if he'd never seen the garbage man before.

Honestly. Rusty had been picking up garbage for the Program since Hazey had bought the property from his dad. The old man was living out his days in a nursing home with Alzheimers. Was there any chance that forgetfulness was catching?

WHITE PAGE. WHITE SHROUDED TREE. White lawn drifted into alien shapes that reminded James of a Hieronymous Bosch painting done in white. Even the people who'd lived their lives in Idaho were shaking their heads at the record-breaking snowfall.

A raven scraped across the sky outside the window in the library carrel where James labored. Its dark shadow looked like a jerky line of handwriting across an empty page.

What James was supposed to do in his Impact Letter was own up to his behaviors. "Take accountability" for all the shit he'd done to his parents. There were two big problems with the assignment due for his family therapy call today. Problem One. James couldn't remember half the shit he'd done in his alcohol and weed and downer-laden fog. Problem Two was overshadowed by the fact that he didn't *want* to remember even a fraction of what he'd done.

At night, around two or three AM, odd flashes of memory continually woke him. A cracked windshield. A girl with a red hair band toking a joint. A curving canyon road lined by black chasms. He cracked a breath mint and even the taste brought back the eucalyptus smell that filled the Corvette in his first waking moments after the crash.

Why would anybody want to take accountability for walking away from the sound of labored breathing? Who would have thought there could be so much blood in her? James had a crappy paperback copy of Macbeth in his backpack, cadged from the Healing House library. In his first months of incarcerated boredom before he'd "earned" the right to take a few classes, he'd whipped through all the thrillers and spy novels, even the romances which gave him quite a few tips on how much girls liked oral sex. Now he was down to the stuff nobody else would read. What blew him away is that he discovered he'd been eating cotton candy when bloody raw steak was available.

He printed out the start of his list laboriously. "I got in a car crash while stoned." Did it sound better to write *I got stoned and the car got away from me*? A memory of leaning over to toke a joint that the girl -- he didn't even know her name \--held out to him. *A girl in a red hair band asked me to give her a ride up Topanga Canyon*. *I thought I was saving her from taking the bus.*

James brushed the memory of the crash away like the glass shards that had littered his lap.

"I stole some money."

It wasn't like taking twenty or thirty bucks from the cash drawer his mom left for the house cleaners was a giant deal. Fungible. A new word he learned in Intro to Humanities with Dr. Lengel. Mom, a neurologist with an international reputation, replenished the drawer like clockwork every few weeks. What was a fungible fifty or a hundred between family members?

He checked the clock on the library wall. An hour already gone. Mrs. Lengel pointed out a list sentence in Huck Fin about rafting on the Mississippi that lazed on for 174 words. Her advice*: When you're stuck you can always write a list..*

Lying

Drinking

Getting stoned

Skipping class

Writing prescriptions from Dr. Ida's prescription pad

Taking household items to sell on eBay

Dad hadn't said anything but James was waiting for him to ask about his missing Patek Phillippe watch. James circled back and scratched out the prescription pad admission. Maybe Mom, who was brilliant about stuff like axonal connections and glioblastomas and meningiomas but clueless about simple James, hadn't caught on yet. He still had a blank pad or two hidden away at home, just in case.

What else?

Just cover the big stuff Josh had said. Where did walking away from a bleeding lump in the passenger seat fall? Was there some category beyond the big stuff for the heinous?

Driving while intoxicated.

The last item on the list of big stuff.

He shut the notebook, releasing the heinous with the raven.

Nevermore.

CLANK. BAM! WHANGGGGG!

Rachel started up like she\'d been shot. She looked at the neon numbers of the clock. 5:15? Jesus. Then she settled back in the warm sheets and put the pillow over her head. Why did they have to pick up the garbage at the crack of dawn?

Old Girl, in the bed across the room, groaned in a sleep-groggy voice. \"It\'s part of treatment. It\'s called trash pick-up torture."

Across the room, Old Girl gets up and padded to the bathroom. Double shit. The second the thought of throwing up entered Rachel's consciousness, her mouth filled with saliva.

She'd put their garbage can out in the hall, per the housekeeping rules. What else could she throw up in while Old Girl was on the toilet? Her cowboy hat? No. Fluid gathered. Hurling was imminent. With an Aurora Borealis crackling behind her eyeballs, she stumbled out in the hall and bolted a few feet to the back door.

She ran out on the snowy steps barely registering the icy cold on her bare feet as the contents of her stomach thundered out of her. A hot, foul stream of vomit, orange flecked and viscous, splattered the white grainy snow in front of her.

It seemed like she retched and retched for an hour. Finally, her stomach let up and she straightened up still woozy, pulling down the underpants that had crept up her butt when she bent over in her sleep tee shirt. She spit to clear the vomit from her mouth. Thank God, no one was out in the yard to see her with her ass hanging out and barking like a dog. Her feet were going numb. If she didn't get inside quick, frostbite was going to set in to her toes. Better get inside, she was thinking as she turned toward the back door.

Wha--!? The door, which she thought she'd left wedged open, was locked. She rattled the knob. Naturally, fucking locked to keep the inmates in, she thought resentfully. A purple and pink sunrise haloed the ridge behind Healing House as she picked her way along the girl\'s wing of bedrooms towards the front entrance. She'd have to ring the doorbell. Whoever was Duty today would have to let her in.

She supposed she was going to get a demerit for being outside but what else could she do? Throw up in her bed? She hadn\'t done that since her migraines started at age nine.

A low growl or maybe a groan -- something that sounded inhuman -- made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. A big rust bucket of a truck loaded with garbage bins was parked at an angle in the front driveway.

A very dirty, greasy haired man stood half hidden on the side of the truck and staring at her like she was breakfast. Was that where the moaning sound had come from? The smell of something rotten rolled off the truck--- or was it the filthy man? --- in waves.

"I'm sick," she managed to stammer out. "Now I'm locked out."

He didn\'t say anything. Just kept staring. It took her a second to remember she was naked under the sleep tee shirt except for bikini underpants. She looked down at herself and realized her boobs were poking out of the cotton like twin headlamps. She skirted around him and darted up the steps and pounded on the door while leaning on the bell. She could almost feel his dirty eyes on her backside and she pounded harder with her fist.

It seemed like forever before Charlene, finishing her stint as Night Duty, flipped the dead bolt and opened the door with a questioning expression. Rachel pushed past her and slammed the door shut with a shudder.

\"What in the world?\" Charlene looked rumpled. Sleep crumbs clumped in her lashes. A wrinkle cut across her face from whatever she\'d been sleeping on.

"I'm getting a migraine. I had to throw up, \" Rachel said. \"Old Girl was in the bathroom. I went outside."

Charlene, not the quickest on the uptake under the best circumstances, couldn\'t seem to put the story together.

\"You were outside? Puking? It\'s like five degrees.\"

Rachel\'s feet, which had lost all feeling, chose that minute to telegraph a thousand pins stabbing at her soles. \"Who\'s that weird guy outside? He scared me.\"

Charlene glanced through the front window. The garbage truck rumbled past on the circular drive, emitting a cloud of black exhaust against the pink and blue dawn. \"Him? That\'s Rusty Harrow. He hauls garbage. He runs the dump.\"

Rachel hadn't thought about the tee shirt until she slammed the door shut on the staring man. She was wearing one of Old Girl\'s tee shirts that she'd borrowed yesterday. All hers were in the laundry because she hadn\'t realized you had to put your garbage and your dirty clothes out in the hall in your hamper on Thursdays if you wanted.

She remembered looking at the shirt and wrinkling up her nose at it when she'd read what it said. \"Where\'d you get this thing? It\'s disgusting.\"

Old Girl laughed at her. "It's from the Stockman's Bar in Missoula."

The front of the shirt read, \"Liquor up front.\" On the back, it said, \"Poker in the rear.\"

Old Girl shrugged. \"What can I say? It's Montana humor. One of my friends who goes to the U. Of M. gave it to me.\"

The aura behind Rachel\'s eyes was already dimming from a white corona to a pain-filled tunnel. In her migraine-sensitive state, the smell of diesel clogged not just her nose but her entire body as the entry way went dark at the edges. Eyes like black holes in the man\'s face had been all over her like the foul smell. Liquor up front. Poker in the rear. Had he read the words on the tee shirt before the door banged shut? She hoped not.

JAMES HAD THE BAD LUCK TO run into Rachel in the girl's bathroom at Northern Idaho Community College. He was coming out of the disabled person's stall after waiting a minute or two for the coast to clear after Lydia strolled out. She had reapplied her lipstick.

James had figured out that blow jobs were rough on lipstick. He had pink stains on his underwear to prove it. James took his time doing some stretches. Standing sex put a strain on his lower back. It wasn't that Lydia was heavy, in fact, she was more like an oversexed doll than a taller than normal 18- year-old.

Rachel met his eyes as he came out of the stall. She was leaning against the sink with a frown.

"Why do you let her abuse you?" Rachel said.

"Abuse me? We have sex."

"Leia doesn't give a shit about you. Aren't you worth more than a quickie? "

I'm worth less than a quickie, James thought.

"Do you mind?" Rachel waved toward a stall. \"I\'m here for a reason.\"

Well, me too, James wanted to say. But the door swung open and shit-on-a-stick, James's Intro to Humanities teacher, Mrs. Lengel, walked in.

Professor Lengel looked enquiringly at him. James flashed her his trademark crumpled smile, like maybe she'd think he got mixed up between the Men\'s and the Women\'s and he beat it the hell out of there.

He didn't think Rachel would rat him out back at Inner Horizons, but you never knew. People made up stories about each other in Process Group all the time to relieve the boredom. All he knew about Rachel was that she was a cutter. She seemed a lot more interested in hurting herself than someone as lame as James. There was always hope.

\#

11\.

"DO YOU KNOW THAT GUY?" Professor Lengel looked to Rachel like she wanted to call the cops.

"We're both at Inner Horizons," Rachel said.

Lengel, unlike every townie she'd ever met, didn't look away or turn away or get a smarmy "I'm so sorry" look when Rachel mentioned treatment.

She seemed honestly surprised. "He's the smartest kid in my Intro to Humanities class. What's he doing *there?*"

Trying to survive, like the rest of us, Rachel thought.

"You'd think with those brains he'd be able to tell the difference between the Men's Room and the Women's." The professor was smiling at her. It was weird how Rachel seemed to have lost the ability to recognize a joke when it was offered. Still, the little attempt at humor felt like being remembered on your birthday with something you actually wanted.

Then the thought occurred to Rachel that her American Literature prof probably thought James was meeting *her*. "He's not my boyfriend. He was here when I came in!"

The professor gazed steadily at Rachel and nodded, as if to say that explained something she'd been wondering about. Rachel was taking Lengel\'s American Literature survey class and turned her papers in on time, got mostly A's -- a few B's \-- on her essay tests. Well, except for her latest paper on *Huck Finn*. Rachel was still reeling from the big fat C- minus. Lengel had written, in red accusatory ink, "Come see me!" next to the crappy grade. Before running into her in the bathroom, Rachel had planned to stop by her office after class. God forbid, Lengel would talk about her paper on Huck and Jim\'s homoerotic relationship while some older woman was making disgusting noises in one of the stalls?

"He told me he was from Malibu," Lengel said.

Rachel shrugged. \"I guess. I don\'t really know him.\"

"Maybe he heard the surf was up in Lake Coeur D'Alene."

Again, Lengel's mild attempt at humor took Rachel a minute to process. Professors were somewhere between gods and alien beings to Rachel, like Martians, but better read. The idea that a professor could be a human being hadn\'t occurred to her. In fact, it struck her as more intimate than she wanted to admit, that Lengel was in the women's restroom to pee.

As if Rachel's thought prompted her to action, the professor headed into a stall, saying, "Tell James to stop by my office." Then Rachel heard her muffled voice through the barrier. "And don\'t forget to make your appointment. Your Huck Fin paper is a mess.\"

Great, Rachel thought. Now we're both in trouble.

MARGARET WISHED TO HELL THEY'D bring back corporal punishment. She'd start with whoever clogged the toilet in the Boys' Wing with a sock. Who would try to flush a crew *sock* down the toilet? Margaret didn't even want to think about what was in the sock. The crazy shit these kids thought up.

If they spent half their time devoting their intelligence to fixing their issues instead of acting out, they\'d turn out OK. That was Margaret's common sense opinion. But then, of course, Margaret wouldn\'t have her shitty low-paying job filling out damage claims because one of the Anger Managements punched a hole in the laundry room wall.

When she finished filling, Margaret went into the living room to dust. She thought the photos of people from the old country that took up an entire wall of the Healing House living area would be more interesting if they didn't require so much work. Whose idea were all those heavy gold frames with swirls and furbelows?

On the whole, though, she liked the people in the portraits. They seemed like an industrious lot.

She was keeping one ear half-tuned to the two troublemakers snarking at each other on the couches. Danny, and Essie were waiting for the van to show up to drive them to their therapy appointments in town. A few minutes later, Lydia joined them. They hadn't been together in the same room for more than a few minutes before they sounded like a swarm of angry bees.

Essie had lost weight. She'd dropped sixty pounds, which is why Margaret had to stop by Target on her way to work to pick up something that would fit her. She was still size 2X and nobody had anything big enough to lend her\--not even Margaret whose size 16 pants pinched her in the gut. Too many donuts, gotta quit, she told herself, taking a quick bite of the maple bar she'd picked up at Starbucks.

Danny was involved in some kind of devilment against Essie, Margaret could tell. Essie sagged like a blob of misery taking up most of the plaid couch. Danny sprawled full length on the couch with the bloodstain. Lydia was reading a People magazine at the game table, ignoring them. Between a rock and a hard place. That Danny. She was the meanest girl Margaret had ever met and that was saying something if you were raised on the wrong side of the tracks in Yakima.

Essie hit a milestone in the weekly weigh-in: 285 pounds. Quite an achievement considering she'd entered the Program weighing 365. You'd think those skinny girls would pat Essie on the back for all her hard work. Hell, no. Danny asked Essie how she could stand to see herself in the mirror (Margaret wrote her up immediately). Margaret knew from the grapevine that they called her Cellulitis though she hadn\'t been able to catch them at it. It was like the poor girl\'s fat cells drove those skinny girls crazy.

Margaret spritzed at an image of a peasant woman with vinegar and water, her grandmother's recipe before Windex took over the world. She scrubbed hard at a hickey under the old woman's eye before she realized it was a wen. She looked crow-like in a black dress, black shawl, and a black babushka scarf tied under her chin with both hands folded over a stomach as round as a bowling ball. The hands were chapped and cracked like they'd been dipped in lye. It occurred to Margaret that they probably had been dipped in lye. This woman of all people would appreciate Margret's mother's vinegar solution---gentle! Doesn't take your hide off! ---and not for the first time, Margaret wondered how these people on the wall were related to Dr. Hazey, her crazy, and criminally lazy boss.

It was probably Dr. August Hazey's idea to frame all those photos in dust-sucking frames, she thought darkly.

Manual laborers and soldiers mixed with a pastry chef with a copper bowl as big as he was ---a man who enjoyed the fruits of their labors! --- along with a street sweeper in patched clothes. A bricklayer emerged from a hole in the ground as if from hell.

At least someone saw them. The people weren't invisible to whoever captured them on film, not like she felt herself invisible around the great Dr. Hazey who either barred his office door or floated around in a "haze" of airy and vacant distraction.

Did the workers in the photos wait politely while the photographer fussed with the big box? Maybe they were glad for the rest break in their routine. Or maybe they were just thankful someone noticed what they were doing and thought enough of their labors to record it.

If a photographer wandered through Healing House, Margaret imagined showing herself cleaning toilets or unplugging the one clogged by whoever kept jerking off in his sock. She made a mental note to check all the boys' sock drawers and have a private word with Mr. One Sock Toilet Clogger about the limitations of modern plumbing.

Margaret would ask the photographer if she could be memorialized with an upraised toilet plunger in her right hand like the Statue of Liberty. All the socks she'd rescued would be arrayed around her head like a star. She'd call it *Champion of the Poor Man's Condom*, which she thought was just as good a title as the photo in Hazey's office called *Three Farmers On the Way to a Dance*.

Before Hazey's wife, Alma, left him last year with her horse whisperer (he must have been good at whispering in Alma's ear) Alma told Margaret that the old time photos looked like a "Wanted" gallery. Margaret didn't think the bricklayers and chefs and street sweepers and soldiers and policemen looked criminal. Just criminally overworked.

She balled up another newspaper to rub the streaks off a grim farmer surrounded by grim and dour-faced women; even the children in matching blond braids stared back at her with hard faces. If they were Hazey's relatives, he'd inherited their lack of humor but somehow managed to escape their work ethic.

If Margaret had her say, which she didn't she'd\--. Oh Christ!

Margaret flung away her balled up newspaper, and she was in the middle of the catfight before she could finish her thought.

Danny was yanking Esty\'s hair and Essie---good for her! --- clawed at Danny\'s face with her fingernails. Except Esty's nails were chewed to the quick. Still, she managed to bloody Danny\'s nose\--she must have gotten off the first punch---though Danny was popping her on the ear with a closed fist. Margaret hauled Danny backwards, her arms around her middle, while the girl kicked and flailed. Darlene ran in and actually sat down on Essie. Margaret wasn\'t quick enough to stop Danny\'s boot from connecting with Esty\'s kidneys. Cheap shot, the little shit! Margaret shook the cursing, spitting girl. \"Stop it! Get control of yourself!\" she cried over Esty\'s outraged howls.

Margaret didn\'t have time to ask what started the fight because Big Paul, who'd joined the girls while she was cleaning, started throwing up on the rug. Margaret had just had the orange shag cleaned last week and now this big, usually silent savant was spraying chunks of barely digested egg and oatmeal all over it.

Before she let Danny escape, she made her scrub the worst chunks off the rug with Anti-Icky-Poo. \"Isn\'t this the stuff you use on dog shit?\" Lydia wanted to know. Poop. Blood. Vomit. It\'s all the same, Margaret told her.

By the time she and Darlene got everybody carted off to their therapy appointments, it was time to make her weekly Status Calls to the parents.

Margaret was supposed to call 20 parents once a week to report on the kids' \"progress in daily living.\" Margaret wished fervently she could tell someone how she herself was progressing in daily living.

Was that job at the Tasty Freeze still open?

It paid a dollar an hour less than Day Supervisor at Healing House (Heller House is what she called it when she told Hank, her husband, about her day. He was a Wal-Mart stocker but he'd hurt his back lifting something stupid so they really needed her paycheck. Jobs--at least ones that paid a living wage---weren't thick on the ground in Coeur D'Alene where cheap employers hired part-time so they didn't have to pay benefits.

Two years ago, when Dr. Hazey told her he'd pay her hourly, plus benefits (hallelujah!), she thought she'd won the Powerball Lottery. Of course, she'd gone two years without a raise and Hazey hadn't mentioned the joy of finding a bag of vomit stashed in Danny's closet. If her roommate hadn't complained about the smell, the foul thing would still be there.

Later today she had a meeting with the plumber. Jesus.

Didn't these kids have any idea they'd have to pay a mortgage someday?

DR. HAZEY RIFLED A FINGER over the disorganized shelves of CDs that filled two bookcases across from his desk. He was looking for Boris Godunov but then he decided the Russian revolution and the warring peasants weren't all that relaxing for reviewing cruise brochures. Did proletariats deserve vacation? Or was that reserved for the nobility?

He had to have a vacation to look forward to or all the crap he had to do would make him certifiable. What he really wanted to do was lock his office door, settle back with his Bose head phones that shut out the distant sound of kids squabbling in the game room next door, and spend the rest of the day choosing between the islands of Tahiti or the archipelago of Fiji.

Hi slid Don Ho into the CD player, Tiny Bubbles, The Remastered Classic. Unlocked the bottom drawer of his desk where the palm trees and airbrushed blue waves of a tropical paradise called him away from the view of the icicle-fringed birdbath on his lawn.

Shit. Fucking Calliope, the relentless new bookkeeper had piled a stack of billing on his chair. The yellow post-it note said, "Sign *today*." Fuck. Fuck Fuck. Hazey felt persecuted and put upon by his new hire. The Inner Journey's secret was that it was an Outer Journey for almost everybody he hired with an average turn over rate of 60% according to the uber-organized and military martinet with the unlike name of Calliope Calisto. Even the woman's handwriting was commanding: the Post It note was magic markered and ended in an exclamation mark that looked like a raised finger. A middle finger to Hazey's authority as head of Inner Journeys World Enterprises, with plans for offices in Spokane and Boise and Billings as his 10-step process for taking troubled teens to untroubled maturity took root.

Parents with sick kids were willing to pay through the nose for the hope of mental help, hope being the operative word, not so much the delivered product, if Hazey was willing to admit the truth, which he typically didn't. Especially not now when the pleasure of planning a getaway from his empire warred against the need to run the damn thing.

He settled the fat soft earphones over his head and ukulele chords strummed the palm trees of Fiji and Mauritius and Kona---anywhere far from frozen Idaho---into his ears. He opened a bottle of Quaalude's he'd stashed in his pocket, ignoring the prescription label made out for Rebekah Rabinowitz, the Jewish girl with runaway anxiety that had made her run off and be treated at Harvard's Medill Center when her parents figured out that Hazey's 10-step process was 9 steps short of helping Rebekah cope.

He washed down two 'luuds with a swig of Courvoisier stashed under the vacation brochures and leaned back in the leather chair and flipped through pages of happy silver-haired couples, thin and carefully coifed and proof that money was the only weapon against age.

He didn't hear the door open. Don Ho was warbling about the warm trade winds but he felt a cold ripple of frigid air from the hall as it lifted an invoice off the stack he'd dumped on his desk and floated onto his lap. He'd been admiring a glossy photo of a cabana with a view of the ocean. An invoice stamped "past due" sailed over the page and settled over it like an omen.

When he rocked his chair around, the headphones blasted calming ukulele and harp strings and Hazey could feel the happy slowing of his bloodstream from the double Quaalude booster treat. He flashed a beatific smile. Dr. Augustus Sanders Hazey, Ph.D. and Found of the Inner Horizons Institute headquartered in Coeur D'Alene Idaho, reporting to staff inspiration duty.

Two of his staff members --Calliope and Michael O'Brien, the head therapist\-- were circling each other like a pair of street fighters.

Don Ho evaporated like steam in the face of the Calliope's glare. "How are we going to pay your salary?" she was asking when Hazey proper the earphone on his temples. "Those deadbeats haven't made a payment since August!"

"Etsy's sick!" Michael's big fleshy face was alarmingly red. Not that Hazey was alarmed, but his medical training registered the flush, the rapid pulse in his carotid artery, and the gasp in his voice. Too many burgers and milkshakes were building up in Michael's mid-forties arteries; they were also showing in a belly as big as a pregnant woman's, except lower and drooping over his belt.

"You put her in Stabilization for three weeks. Do you know how expensive 24-hour medical supervisions is? The parents can't pay. Send her home!"

"Over my dead body! Etsy is staying. What the fuck do you know about therapy? You're a book-keeper!"

"I can add," she said sternly. "That's more than you can do."

Hazey heard Don Ho singing in a tinny voice through the earphones that were playing to his frontal lobes. *Here's a toast to the silver sea. And mostly here's a toast to you and me.* Michael and Calliope were both staring at him as if they expected him to say something. What? What could they possibly want when *Tiny bubbles in the wine make me happy, make me happy, make me feel fine?*

"Dr. Hazey, you've got to tell her. We can't release Etsy. She's a powder keg."

Wasn't Etsy that lumbering fat girl with the pimples? Hazey's recollection of Etsy was that she was the one who sat in a great lump answering in monosyllables. He remembered the staff talking about her in weekly staff meeting. She'd go for weeks without speaking a word and then some little thing---not getting the salt passed to her in a timely manner, a sharp word\-\--would set off an explosion of violence. Fork in the back of somebody's hand? Wasn't that what sent her to Stable the last time? Hazey had a dim memory of having to explain the incident to the parents of the kid who's been stabbed. The trick was to minimize the incident to the parents and maximize it on the insurance claim. Who was it who got forked? He'd have to see if he was stilling writing prescriptions in their name. Maybe that would help him remember.

"How late are they?" Hazey had a dim recollection of two hefty, blubbering parents on the couch that Michael and Calliope were now occupying at opposite ends, like two prize fighters waiting in their corners for the bell.

"They haven't made a full payment---" Calliope riffled through her notes with lips pursed in the tiny wrinkle lines of a drawstring purse. What a good person to have collecting fees, floated through Hazey's bubbles. A purse that only took money in and never let it out. He was flooded with a sense of love and well being. If he had any sexual feelings, which he had long ago forgotten due to the cocktail of uppers, downers and status quo drugs he used, he would marry her. Perhaps Michael should marry her as Hazey's proxy? He could bring up the idea at Michael's next review.

"Dr. Hazey? The two of them were looking at him with hungry eyes.

Michael's voice seemed to be coming from far above the thin voice of Don Ho reverberating on his temple like a small buzzing fly. His nose was pressed to the glass plate that protected the rosewood surface of the desk. It felt cool on his forehead. "*Here's to the golden moon. Here's to the silver sea. Here's to me and me."*

"Umm. Are you feeling OK, Doc?"

Warm, tropical darkness.

THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN GRINCHIN AND Margaret started when Gretchen ordered her to stop vacuuming and set the dinner table.

Margaret said, \"Why don\'t we make the kids set the table? Seems like they\'re big enough to help around here.\" Margaret and Gretchen were in the Healing House kitchen, which looked just like a normal kitchen except for the teddy bear canister on the counter that promised cookies and never delivered them. Blond oak cabinets, dishes stacked in a dish rack, that indefinable astringent smell of the salad dressings Gretchen favored with too much vinegar and not nearly enough oil.

\"Do you have any idea what their parents pay to park them here?\" Gretchen said

\"It has nothing to do with how much we charge," Margaret said. \"How are they ever going to learn responsibility if they never have to work?\" Most of the boys and a few of the girls were lounging in the living room, waiting for dinner to be served. They were killing time with a Monopoly game that was probably in the billions by now.

\"Mind your own business,\" Gretchen said. \"Nobody pays you to think.\"

Margaret couldn't believe she'd heard her right. She stood up to her full 5\' 9 3/4." She\'d always been a big-boned, now, at 50, she was an even bigger with an extra fifty pounds across the beam.

Margaret thought she saw Gretchen swallow until she went back to peering into the refrigerator like a woman who did not expect anything worth eating to come out of it. It was a giant industrial refrigerator; double-sided and packed full of stuff Margaret had shopped for at Costco. Her tall tuft of gelled hair at her widow's peak, her only nod to frivolity, fluttered up above the top of the Frigidaire like a cox comb as her hand went unerringly to the giant bag of spinach she'd been serving for the past three weeks "I know!" she said brightly, like the idea had just occurred to her. "Spinach salad!"

Margaret attempted to keep her voice flat. Noncommittal. "The kids keep sending back their salads. It's all going in the trash."

"Spinach is a nutritional powerhouse!" Gretchen cried, as if Margaret was suggesting heresy.

Margaret couldn't help herself. She said the first thing that came into her mind. "Only if they actually eat it."

Just then, a Nerf ball flew between the two women. It landed in the serving dish Margaret had just taken out of the cupboard

\"Who threw that?" Gretchen cried. "Automatic black mark!"

The silence of the dead lengthened from the family room where all twelve of them pretended to be reading a magazine or doing their nails.

Gretchen stomped over to the empty bowl and removed the Nerf ball.

\"We\'ll take this up with Dr. Hazey tomorrow." She whacked the dinner gong that doubled as a mediation gong in Dialectical Behavior Therapy. It sat on the sideboard and its rich tone filled the dining room like a new round of a prizefight.

Shit, shit, shit, Margaret said to herself. Me and my big yap.

The vision of the line of pill bottles marched like obedient soldiers across the marble counter came to her. It occurred to her that what she needed was something she could hold over Hazey, if Gretchen tried to force her out.

So she didn\'t have a college degree. She didn\'t even have a high school diploma. So what? She had Charlie, her big 27-year-old boy, whom she\'d had to drop out of school for. Back in the day, she and Hank had spent high school humping like rabbits in the backseat of his car. One leg draped over the back of the seat, the feel of plastic under her butt. Almost thirty years later, she could still remember burst of stars the day she had her first orgasm. Since Hank hurt his back, she missed those rodeo rides and she hoped old Hank wasn\'t permanently out to pasture or she didn\'t know what she\'d do. She\'d seen vibrators in the window of the Coeur d\'Alene Love Nest, but couldn't imagine being satisfied with a piece of cold rubber.

Grinchin had two degrees, a college degree from Central Washington University in Ellensburg and a Masters in Nutrition that she never tired of bragging on from the University of Washington. What neither of those degrees had taught her was how to make a anything that was edible.

Margaret knew she could cook circles around skinny Gretchen. Gretchen Beener was a tall, underfed woman with a shorn head. It reminded Margaret of her boys' crew cuts Hank made them wear when they got lice.

It wasn't clear why Gretchen wore it so short that all you could see was scalp. One little tuft of gelled cowlick stuck up above her widow's peak like a cock's comb. At least it would be easy to take care of, unlike Margaret's gray streaked mane of unmanageable curls.

Gretchen also liked to wear unisex clothing. Unisex always made Margaret think of universal sex, meaning a proclivity for sleeping with everyone. But as far ash she knew, Gretchen rode horses in her spare time and that hardly counted as sex. She had been single as long as she'd worked at Inner Horizons, which was only a year longer than Margaret, although the woman liked to make it sound as if she'd been around since God created Inner Horizons.

If Margaret had been around that long, she hoped that the place would be a lot better-organized and not such a revolving door.

What was it about skinny people that made them so bad at food? Margaret and Hank had gone to a Christmas party at the owner of the freight hauling business Hank drove for, when he wasn\'t laid up because of his back. The wife of the owner of Idaho Freight was a tiny, bird-boned woman, no bigger than a 12-year-old. Margaret had never tasted a worse Xmas spread. Runny potato salad. Tarts with a kind of cardboard quiche that tasted anemically of lard. You weren\'t sure if they were supposed to be dessert or dinner bites \-- they were mixed in with brownies from Safeway and Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies that were the size and consistency of hockey pucks.

\"Isn\'t the food divine?\" the owner\'s wife had trilled. \"My tennis friend just started a catering business and I\'m her first customer.\" Margaret hoped the woman was her last customer, grimly thinking about the Christmas party next year, assuming Hank wouldn\'t be permanently laid off if his back didn\'t improve.

She could do the cook\'s job that Gretchen was supposed to be doing and the kids would think they\'d died and gone to heaven. She had enough common sense enough to follow a recipe and try some variations to improve the taste. Hell, she\'d take a nutrition class at night and now that she was motivated to learn and not blinded by her hormones and the muscles in Hank's football player\'s ass, she\'d be just fine at studying.

She slapped the last piece of cutlery next to the plate. Gretchen wandered by and she turned the knife over at each place setting because Margaret had set the knife blade facing away from the fork.

USUALLY, RUSTY LIKED RUNNING RECON surveillance later in the night when everybody else was asleep but the radio said an arctic front was moving south over Idaho like a freight train. More fucking snow to shovel off his porch.

That's why he decided to run recon early. It was only about 10:30 PM, a few lights from Healing House streamed out weak rays on the snowdrifts. It didn't feel like snow. Too fucking cold, if you could believe the wall-mounted thermometer near the front door. Fucking eight degrees below zero. Freeze your balls off if you weren't careful.

He trudged around the back of Healing House, keeping close to the eaves where the snow only skimmed an icy fringe on the leaves. He worked his way around the sleeping wing where the boy's were, ducking under the windows, which were mostly dark with an occasional ray of warmth. He paused when he got to the back of the main house near the big picture window in the living room where they had all those couches.

He remembered those couches. Charlene Hightman---man, they'd had fun in high school chanting "Hymen! Hymen! Charlene's lost her Hymen!" back in the days before she ballooned up to like two hundred and fifty pounds---old fatso Charlene was on one of them couches, reading a magazine and eating a bag of Cheetos. Her hand dipped orange clusters from the bag to an orange-tinged mouth like a shovel grader. He bobbed under the window, not that worried about her seeing him in his stealth suit. Black down jacket, black ski hat pulled down to cover his face so only his eyes showed, and brown Carrhardt's that had never been washed, so they looked black enough. At the far side of the window, he surveyed Charlene who now had a slash of orange Cheetos dust from her cheek to her ear. Beyond the mechanical dip-grab-and- chew motions of her hands and mouth, a wall of old time people in gold frames looked down on her. The new track lighting hadn't been installed the day Rusty and the Old Man had strapped the new bookshelves to the wall right before Healing House opened. Some kind of earthquake protection required by a government agency. Were there people in the government who oversaw crazy people? If so, why didn't they govern the Old Man from beating the skin off his back when he was deep in a whiskey bottle and mad at anything that moved?

The old man had caught him napping on one of the couches Charlene Wightman was sitting on. Nobody else was around so the old man had gone out to the truck for his bottle, which Rusty judged from experience as safe for a little shut-eye. He must have slept too long because the next thing he knew, the old man was whaling the shit out of him. You get woken up out of a dead sleep with some one stropping your back with a belt and you're not in your right head for a minute. Rusty remembered a dazed feeling of helplessness, his hands covering his head and neck like you would against a bear but he did it to preserve what was left of his hearing. The old man was swearing "Lazy cocksucking cunt! Lazy cocksucking cunt!" with every blow.

Somewhere in the middle of the shit storm, Hazey had charged in to the rescue and yanked the old man off. Rusty couldn't exactly recollect what Hazey had said to get the old man to lay off but he had a clear recollection of himself lying on his side all curled up, his back and kidneys on fire, looking up at a whole jury of people staring down at him from the wall.

It was a gallery of old people, well, not all old, some of them were just kids, but they were all from olden times, past historical people from a long time ago---old women in black babushka scarves and soldiers in Nazi helmets and a fat cook. Most of them were working people, it looked like; they weren't in big fancy houses. Still, they made him feel small, like they were secure standing in their own shoes but their security made him question his own. Who are you, they seemed to ask. Who the fuck are you?

If there was one thing he knew it was that he, Rusty Harrow, was a lazy cocksucking cunt. His old man had said he was a lazy cocksucking cunt for as long as he could remember and now there were twenty-five or thirty people on the wall, every one of them with the same judgment in their eyes.

Hazey had tried to convince him to call the cops on the old man but how stupid was that? The old man would just beat him with a two-by-four when he got him cornered at home. As beatings went, a few stripes on his back weren't worth making a molehill.

Weird. He hadn't thought about the Old Man for years. He blamed it on seeing that wall of old time people behind Charlene after all these years. They were looking at her liked they'd looked at him. As if they were passing judgement.

How long had Rusty been standing at the window mouth breathing? His feet felt like stone, his breath frozen like a glob of jizz on the picture window. Charlene was nearly finished with her jumbo bag of Cheetos. He practically sprinted across the main part of the house, then he humped it along the back of the girl's wing to the front where the blond girl slept He was in luck. Though it was too fucking cold to watch her for more than a few minutes, her red reading light was still on as she hunkered down in a mound of blankets with a book. Everything else in the room was dark. In the circle of reddish light, she looked golden. Inviting as a match flame.

It was all he could do not to climb through her window to get warm.

"NO! NOT SPINACH AGAIN!\" Ben, the whiner who\'d only been at the program for a month, flicked the limp pile of leaves off his plate onto the tabletop.

Gretchen who dropping a shriveled over-baked yam onto Rachel\'s plate said, \"Put that back on your plate. First warning.\"

Ben glared at her and left the spinach on the table like a gauntlet.

Then Omar, who was sitting next to Ben, scraped his spinach off his plate. A second gauntlet.

Gretchen said evenly, \'Second warning, Ben. First warning, Omar.\"

All twelve people at the dining table quieted waiting for the next move.

Rachel uncertainly took a bite of the limp greens while a cherry tomato beamed like a transit light. Unfortunately it was slimy and had an off taste that made her gag. She spit the bite out, intending to hit the plate, but the glop of masticated spinach plopped onto the table. Not a gauntlet. More like a gob stopper.

Gretchen\'s eyes widened like she was thinking "E tu, Brute", and Rachel was horrified to hear her say, \"You three. Four demerits each. Leave the table.\"

Omar and Ben must have had some kind of pact of solidarity because neither of them moved a muscle. Rachel started to stand but suddenly spinach was flying like green confetti. People were grabbing the greens from the salad bowl and flinging them at each other. Gretchen took a direct hit to the cheek while the yams became more lethal projectiles.

\"Food fight!\"

"Yam this yam up your ass,\" Omar yelled and Gretchen ducked. Orange yam gunk hit the dining room wall where she'd been standing and slipped down the paint like a runny egg.

Gretchen had a death grip on the call button. Bruce came running from the direction of the office, Margaret from the kitchen.

Margaret thundered in the voice of a drill sergeant. \"Stop! You kids sit down!\" She banged a wooden spoon on the stainless steel bowl that a few leaves of spinach still clung to and a line from a Shakespearean sonnet came to her in the chaos. *That time of year when\...when yellow leaves or none or few do hang\...*

Rachel got her 1st full tilt demerit day. Toilet cleaning, after emergency therapy session and yet another accountability letter. Omar got sent to Isolation. And Ben. Ben went home. What kind of incentive were full demerits when they got you released from hell?

RUSTY KNEW THE NUT HOUSE inside and out.

His old man used to do pick-up carpentry and repair work when he wasn\'t hitting the bottle and he\'d drag the piss-ant with him to lug lumber and hand him tools. If he didn\'t know the difference between a lag bolt and a nut, he\'d get a cuff on the ear that would make his head ring. Still it hadn\'t been all work and no play. Rusty had been small enough to go through the duct work overhead and he'd learned the places in the crawl space where you could enter the main floor through a plywood door with a busted latch.

All this was way before Hazey bought the Christiansen place to turn into a daycare for fruitcakes.

It had been easy to exit the crawl space through the small door that led directly to the laundry room. He just had to make sure Margaret O'Leary didn\'t get wind of him in the house. He could hear her singing over the whir of a vacuum. Did that nosy bitch never shut her pie hole? He cracked all the windows facing the back of the house. Not enough to attract notice, just wide enough to snake a golf club handle through the gap.

Mind the gap. The phrase floated in his mind when he made it outside to test thehomemade claw. Had he heard it on TV? He didn\'t know any English people. Not many of them in Idaho. What did mind the gap mean exactly? He was worried that he hadn\'t widened the window gap enough because the vice gripper head he\'d welded to the shaft\--actually a Ping golf club he\'d lifted from a bag that was leaning up against the country club house--- was wider than his hand.

The claw gripper had a hook on one end and could pull open drawers and lift out bras or lacy panties or tee-shirts that still smelled of the sleeping girls in the beds.

The fucker was heavy. He should have started with something thinner but there was a fine line between being thick enough to hold the shaft stiff the width of a dorm room and being too thin and droopy. The claw hand which he needed to grip\--the whole point was to be able to take what he liked\--was made of light-weight plastic but when he got the bright idea to add a remote controlled camera, the weight just got out of hand.

Still he was proud of his handiwork. The claw could pull open drawers, pick stuff up or drop it. The camera eye could work like a video or a still camera though he hadn\'t been able to figure out how to turn off the shutter click. Rusty was good with his hands. His welding skills were OK. The tool might not win any beauty contest but it looked damn good as it hovered over the dark dresser top and descended to the drawer pull where he activated the vise grip so it could get grasp the wooden knobs.

It took a coupla tries to get the top drawer open. He had to pull one corner of the drawer out and then lever the claw over to the other knob on the drawer in order to drag it open. He was rewarded for getting a tired shoulder by the sight of underwear. Lots of underpants folded in a stack next to lacy bras that looked ethereally bright in night vision mode of the Montrief spy camera that he painted with camouflage green and brown.

He whistled low under his breath when the claw hook picked up a bra by the strap. Its cups were deep and radiant even through the monitor he propped on the outer window still was only 3\" wide. He\'d wanted to spring for the bigger 6x9 version but money was too goddamned tight. The problem with living in goddamned rural Idaho not that he was planning on living anywhere else, was that cheap-ass Idahoans could dump their garbage for free by driving out any logging road ten minutes out of town when they should have been paying Harrow Dump. Why pay Rusty Harrow their lousy \$20 fee when they could give their shit the heave-ho for goddamned free?

The bra floated as if by magic over the sleeping form of the girl with the weird matted hairdo. Her face was turned away from the window and the weird looking clump of hair hung over the side of the mattress like a bunch of rat-tails. He reeled the bra closer, slowing down when he got near the window so he could it by the strap and haul it off the hook.

He almost came on the spot when the buried his nose in the cup and got a whiff of lavender. He imagined Titty Girl's nipple touching the place where his nose was buried.

He jerked off, his dick wrapped in lace, and felt the top of his head come off when he shot his wad into the perfumed cup. Oh holy Christ. He would have chopped his whole arm off if he\'d known it would feel this good.

When his heart rate went back to normal, he made a second pass with the claw over the other dresser, the one by the wall. You had to be careful not to knock the bottles and picture frames off the top. He wasn\'t looking for anything in particular. Something to go with the bra that belonged to the tall blond girl with the ponytail and smooth legs that went all the way up. Maybe he could snag some of that lavender spray though he was scared to fuck with tiny glass bottles even with the anti-grip safety mesh he\'d lined the claw hand with.

Every time he saw the blond, she was either surrounded by a passel of kids from the program or she was hunkered down in her bed, propped up against the pillows, writing.

The claw hovered over the desktop and cast triangular shaped arcs on striped white paper. A diary? He closed the claw fingers with the hand gripper and levered a spiral bound notebook through the air holding his breath as he passed within a foot of the rat girl's head. A breeze from the open window fluttered the papers. He hoped they weren\'t flapping enough to give him away. The shutter clicks when he took pictures were enough to wake the dead.

Now the problem was getting a goddamned notebook through the crack. Fuck. He'd always chosen small stuff \-- jewelry, the occasional iPod, twenty-dollar bills or rare coins.

He felt the grip slipping. At the last minute, he was able to set the notebook on the bed next to the sleeping rat girl\'s feet. He re-gripped it so the long claw finger pinned the pad on the long end and miracle of miracles, he was able to heft it sideways through the narrow gap.

No more minding the gap, he told himself as he crunched across the snowy field to the next driveway over where he\'d parked his truck. He could read the black magic marker name in a loopy schoolgirl\'s hand. Rachel Interlachen.

Titty Girl had a name.

MARGARET WHIPPED AROUND THE CORNER followed by a man Rachel didn\'t recognize. They were carrying big boxes so Rachel stopped to the side of the hall and made herself small, so they could pass through.

Margaret nodded thanks. \"Meet Charlie," Margaret said. "He's my baby.\"

Charlie looked like a thin and lean version of Margaret who claimed her butt wasn\'t built for a doublewide. They shared the same brown half-moon eyes and dishwater shade hair, and wide easy smiles.

\"He\'s kind of big for a baby,\" Rachel said, eyeing the tall man in his thirties.

\"You\'re looking at the reason all I have is a high school degree." Margaret laughed and Charlie rolled his eyes.

\"You got the better part of that bargain,\" Charlie said. \"What would you do without me to take your boxes in with the creepy crawly spiders."

\"We\'re putting the ornaments away in the crawl space.\" It was nearing the end of January. Rachel thought it was strange the outside fairy lights were still looping the trees and lighting the windows like Christmas was perpetual in Idaho. She thought it was some kind of weird local tradition.

Both of them were loaded down with boxes stacked high. Charlie\'s stack teetered alarmingly so Rachel said, \"Here. Give me the top one.\"

She followed Margaret who was still gabbing up a storm and Charlie took the rear.

\"How old is he?\" Rachel asked Margaret. Her ears were on alert for what Margaret used the verboten B word. She\'d erased it from own vocabulary the day she woke in a hospital bed with an ache between her legs and a plundered belly.

\"Thirty-three on May 29,\" Margaret said. \"Everybody else was picking up their graduation diplomas and he\'s what they gave me instead.\"

\"Mom!\" Charlie protested. \"She doesn\'t want to hear all that ancient history. Shut up!\"

\"He used to be such a good baby,\" Margaret said sotto voce. Then he turned two and he\'s never given me a moment\'s peace.\"

\"Unless you count the fact that I\'m here to store the boxes with the spiders because you\'re such a chicken.\"

\"Shhhh!\" Margaret holds a finger to her lips. \"She\'ll think I\'m one of the nuts.\"

Rachel couldn\'t help liking Margaret's son. Margaret herself was incorrigible. Everybody else in the treatment program talked about diagnoses and tendencies and bandied terms like bipolar and borderline and DSMIV like they were speaking a foreign psychiatric language. Only Margaret used fruitcake and psycho and crazy. It was against the rules for the patients to use these words \-- Hazey had a pat lecture about how nobody was a diagnosis here in Idaho \-- but Rachel supposed Margaret had to get caught to get in trouble.

Charlie went into the crawl space with the first box on his hands and knees. He had a flashlight in his mouth after the initial try when he said it was \"black as a witch\'s tit.\" Was that an Idahoism? Rachel had already stored up \"shut your pie hole\" and \"crick\" instead of \"creek.\" She added "witch's tit" to her growing list.

The crawl space ran under the girl\'s wing of the sprawling ranch house. The living room and kitchen and dining room where they met for meals and Group made up the central part of the house. The boy's wing extended south of the core, while six girls\' rooms angled in an ell to the east. \"Don\'t push the boxes in too deep,\" Margaret called to Charlie. \"Or we\'ll never find them.\"

Rachel took over feeding boxes to Charlie, pushing them into the dark so he could pull them in to the stash.

\"Is it true you got pregnant in high school or were you joking?\" Rachel asked while they waited for Charlie.

\"Nothing funny about that,\" Margaret said. \"My dad nearly killed me.\"

Rachel remembered the while-lipped anger on her father\'s face when she finally told her parents. Her mom wouldn\'t look at her. She came home to frost and ate meals in a deep freeze and went to bed under layers of quilts and still felt cold.

\"Did you raise him yourself?\"

\"Oh hell no. Hank and I got married in a shotgun wedding. 33 years next April.\"

Margaret who never seemed to miss a trick, said, \"You seem pretty interested in this. Want to tell me why?\"

Rachel shoved the next-to-the-last box into the dark hole. \"Not really,\" she said.

\"Have it your way, honey. Sometimes it\'s nice to talk about your troubles. God knows, I\'ve had a few.\"

Rachel made a quick escape, saying she had to get back to study for a history test. She already had the information down but something about Margaret\'s generous offer of support made her want to burrow under her covers and sob. Would she never lose the feeling of emptiness that always seemed to echo in her flattened belly? She had the stretch marks to prove she once had a baby but where was he? Who took him? Where did he go?

She heard Charlie behind her, calling, \"Spidey, spidey! Look Mom, it\'s a hairy wolf spider just for you.\"

Margaret yipped and Charlie laughed and Rachel sped away until she was practically running to get to her room.

Maybe it was meeting Charlie. Or maybe it was Margaret offering to talk that woke Rachel about midnight from a deep sleep feeling cold.

It turned out she\'d kicked the covers off and the ducting, which had to travel a long distance from main furnace, wasn\'t able to heat the cheaply insulated rooms. She got up and slammed the window which was open 3 or 4 inches shot, not caring if she woke Old Girl because she\'d asked her not to leave the window open when it was below freezing outside.

Old Girl had denied opening the window. She was probably smoking dope near it when Rachel wasn\'t around, leaving it cracked so the smoke could escape. Rachel had never smelled any weed on Old Girl but why else would her roommate dread her hair like a Rastafarian? Wasn\'t ganja like part of the religion?

She lay down and slid deep in the flannel sheets and tried to will herself back to sleep.

The easy laughter between Charlie and Margaret kept reverberating in her brain. The way Margaret's son teased her with the wolf spider and made her scream. All her longing and memories of waking in the hospital with a deflating belly and nothing to replace its solidity had been focused on the loss of an infant. It hit her like a brick between her ears that she was missing an entire *life.* Preschool and kindergarten. Drawings on the refrigerator. Little League and Peewee soccer. High school dramas and prom night. That the baby would be a person with a sense of humor and his own response to his mother and how she treated him over the years had escaped her. She fell asleep thinking *Eensie weensie spider, went up the waterspout, down came the rain and washed the spider ou*t.

A BIG-ASSED WOMAN IN A GRAY sweatshirt that read "Don't Mess with Mom" met Chase Mortimer at the door of an ordinary ranch house.

"Margaret, here," she said. "And you\-- you're the newest addition to Healing House?" To Chase's ears, she sounded ironic, like he'd just won the Lottery but she was going to keep the winnings.

Thankfully, he'd managed to stash one last snort of cocaine beneath the insole of his Nikes. When Margaret left him in the homey living room "to get some forms," he burned rubber to get to the powder room with a big weird tub.

Nineteen hours before, two unsmiling men with matching NRA tiepins had dragooned Chase away from his dorm room in Middlebury, Vermont. He was at the end of a three-day drug and booze fest that had been preceded by months of an upsy-down-daisy-chain of 'luuds and amphetamines i.e. freshman year at Bard College as he was enjoying it.

Matthias, the wiry, tense escort with a crew-cut, had strip-searched Chase down to his socks and underwear while Aldus, the fat one who popped Mentos like a chain smoker, packed his duffle bag. Neither one had the balls to stick their nose into Chases' running shoes; hence the heartfelt Hallelujah Chorus Chase was humming as he shook out a thin line of white powder on the counter top.

Chase bent to the line the way a man dying of hunger bends to an all-u-can-eat buffet. He Hoovered up a sustaining snort and then paused, regretting that this was the last of his stash, not wanting to think too hard about how the hell he was going to replace it in the middle of fucked-up Idaho where his fucking parents had locked him up at a fucking psychiatric treatment program designed to keep him from fucking around.

The drug fiesta drain had been draining out of his blood stream for the past couple of hours. He needed the white line not so much as to get high but to stay as-is, or at least able to maintain. A movement beyond a small square window in the wall interrupted the next snort.

A furry, feral creature with a black mask was staring at him through the glass with a look of disapproval. Chase's heart rate was already rocketing---it was good New Jersey shit. He\'d stolen it from his dealer before the stingy shit had a chance to cut it. What? Chase wanted to ask the fur ball. What do you know that I don't?

The creature had a sizeable gray ruff. Black bands that circled its body. A bushy black-and-white striped tail floated over its raised back like a warning flag. It stood eye level with him; a yellow grapefruit perched like a beanie on its head.

Chase had only snorted a tiny squiff. Three quarters of the line remained. One part of his brain registered judgment in the beady black eyes while the rest of his brain cells took in the pointed muzzle, black-tipped and moist, and gray fingers the size of elf hands. The creature lifted the grapefruit rind off its head and held it up to Chase like a chalice.

As it nibbled daintily at the fruit, the raccoon looked so much like Chase's mother, his heart stuttered into quick time. For an instant, he wondered if perhaps it was a good thing he was in Idaho at a treatment center if he was going to be visited by a grapefruit-eating mother who seemed to have turned herself into a raccoon. This thought was pushed away by the sight of a fat snarling raccoon looming behind the grapefruit eater with a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth.

Chase heard a yowl that reminded him of two 'hos he'd seen fighting in a dispute over a john in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. The grapefruit flew. A moil of striped fur and white-and-black tails and slashing claws broke out as two raccoons turned into one hellish circle of fur and teeth.

He sneezed through his abused sinuses and dimly registered the spray of red mist that dotted the oak counter top like a rash. It felt like he'd been snorting sand and his heart rate was on triple time.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Loud raps shook the door. "Yo!\"You OK in there? Need help?" A woman's voice seemed to occupy the whole powder room.

"Uhhhh..." He paused. "Is it I.... \"Or is there a cat fight outside?"

The woman---the name Margaret seemed to reach him from a faraway place\--sucked in a deep, indignant breath. "Son of a bitch!" she cried. "Those little motherfuckers!"

By the time Chase finally got himself out of the bathroom, he wandered the living room and dining room, and then peeked down a hall of closed doors, expecting the big woman to be up in his grill about how long he'd been in the john. Strangely, the living area, which seemed occupied by way too many couches, was empty and silent as a church.

Chase walked over to a big window and watched half a dozen raccoons milling around and snuffling amongst a mess of overturned garbage cans in a snowy driveway.

It seemed the fur ball fight was over. A baby-sized raccoon teetered on the rim of one bin, then dropped abruptly into its dark maw. A burly raccoon with a fat ringed tail bobbed up from the depths with its head embedded in a yogurt container.

Chase tried to shake off the feeling that his heart was going to carry off his body. He was aware that raccoons were a normal phenomenon in the American west. He'd seen them in alleys on Manhattan's upper Eastside where Mom and Dad lived in a brown stone between an investment banker and a seat holder on the New York Stock Exchange. Get me out of here, he was thinking, at the sight of big-assed Margaret stomping past the window with a big-ass shotgun raised to a big-ass shoulder.

She looked like Annie Oakley in knee-high boots. Rifle stock pressed to an eye socket, meaty finger pumping the trigger.

It was one thing to go from a cute masked critter that looked like his mother wearing a grapefruit on its head to the same masked creature's head flying into red and gray mist from the force of a large bore rifle.

When Chase uncovered his eyes, he saw no signs of life. No tails. No tiny ashen fingers. Just a limp, gray carcass amid salad slime and crumpled newspapers and coffee grounds strewn around the driveway like the end of a Mexican-themed frat party.

Chase sank to a couch, chest banging in his throat. He no longer had a heartbeat. He felt like his head was being jackhammered until a burst of light split his brain wide open like a rotten cantaloupe.

By the time Margaret got back to the living room, she found the new kid---Jason? Chasen?\-- passed out on a couch. She couldn't figure out what the hell was wrong with him.

One minute she was standing around waiting for him to finish in the bathroom so she could explain the house rules and then she'd had to run outside to chase off those fucking raccoon who'd gotten into the garbage again before Hazey arrived with the Certification Review Team. She'd have done anything to avoid Hazey's shit fit; he'd already declared on jihad on the coons. The kid had seemed fine when he went to the bathroom, hung over, maybe a little strung out, just like every other kid who came escorted to the program.

At first, she thought he was asleep.

She'd watched his chest for a minute, expecting to see it rise and fall. Instead, a pulse jumped erratically in his throat like a live wire. His pulse rate was so high, she could barely count it. She flipped the kid up to sitting and forced his head down between his knees, holding him down to level out his blood pressure while she speed-dialed 9-1-1.

Shit in a shoe!

Hazey didn't pay her enough to let a kid barely out of high school die on the couch of heart failure.

HAZEY HAS DONE EVERYTHING HUMANLY possible to prepare for the Certification Review Board.

Staff: prepped, processed and protocolled.

Rules and regulations drilled into every employee and memorized on pain of dismemberment.

Facility: carpets cleaned, walls scrubbed, new primer and fresh latex paint except for the spot where they'd had to cut in new dry wall over the hole that Danny had punched in the laundry room. All the photos dusted and straight.

Dietetics: new color menus, printed calorie counts, optional meal plans for vegetarians, vegans, the gluten intolerant.

Kids: bribed and brow beaten to behave in exchange for all the pizza they could eat along with an extortionate D.J. signed up to spin every rap hate song on the parental discretion list.

He'd thought of everything.

He'd picked up the Certification Review Panel members at the Spokane Airport in his Lexus and he was now busy pointing out the record snowfall to the reviewers as he ferried them to Coeur D'Alene. Snow berms along I-90 reached as higher than the one-story bungalows that lined the highway. All three of the reviewers, Seattle natives used to damp and wet, were bundled up like North Face eskimos.

At one point on the drive, the sky cleared to glacial blue and the weak winter sun spangled the white caps on Lake Coeur D'Alene and the two female reviewers in the back seat squealed appreciatively. Even the sober-faced head of the committee, Dr. Edward Obadiah, whistled a low, musical tone. "God's country," Hazey said modestly to all-around nods. He suppressed his habit of amending the phrase to "God-Forsaken Country" without a hitch. Lumpy cumulus clouds promised another snow dump before midnight when thankfully, the review committee would be long gone.

Everything had been going so well.

Their first stop had been to the Blue Horizons, the halfway house where kids who'd graduated from lock-down in Intensive were able to able to attend college or work and live on their own with minimal supervision. Hazey told them it was part of the Inner Horizon's grand plan to offer clients a re-entry phase to real life.

A process group had been underway. No one showboated or exchanged blows. Chocolate chip cookies were baking in the kitchen so the house smelled just like home sweet home (Hazey had cadged this trick from his real estate agent.) Per instructions, the dining table was set with white table cloth and Delft-blue China plates and matching silver. No steak knives, of course.

Even Dr. Hazey who knew better, thought the Blue Horizons part of the tour projected total serenity and security and order. It was like seeing whole cloth woven out of the patched-together tattered truth, which was usually angry, and cursing young people acting out in worn surroundings where the walls had been repainted and the dry wall patches were still wet.

He almost didn't extend the tour to Healing House. He could have held off the iffiest part of the tour till it was double staffed to keep everyone on his best behavior. Still, staff and residents all had their marching orders on pain of death, so in a moment of poorly placed optimism, he decided to ignore the fact that it was perilously close to the 4 PM cyanide hour when both infants and psychiatric patients tended to fall apart like time bombs in the late afternoon.

He knew it was a bad omen when an ambulance roared past the car on Strenger Road barely a mile from Healing House. Only the town dump was located beyond them and people usually dropped things at the dump instead of trying to resurrect them. What the hay?

A hearse-length white ambulance was parked right in front of the Healing House doors. Hazey pulled his Lexus SUV up behind it, next to the garbage bins.

Hazey clumped around the front of the SUV in big rubber packs, knowing the snow and ice was treacherous in soft-soled shoes. He was just in time to see Dr. Obadiah planting one Italian leather loafer on a slick of salad slime.

Haley was having one of those life-altering elastic moments when time slows down and it was almost possible to measure one's own heart beats while the pause between them felt like a little death. The leg in the gray knife-pleated pants shot up in the air. A leather-gloved hand flew toward the sky to clutch at nothingness. The infinitesimal glide of a smooth sole on a sheen of ice. The sober-featured Dr. Obadiah with four advanced degrees in psychiatry and an MBA in public health as well as business administration went down like a brick of heavy expectations.

His oiled black hair was haloed by a dark blotch of coffee grounds. One hand stretched above his head with the index finger pointing to a pink grapefruit and Hazey had a vision of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel portrait of God touching life---or was it death?---into Adam.

The door to Healing House banged open. A gurney pushed by two medics trundled out with a white figure in a body bag. Margaret appeared at the end of the parade. Seeing Hazey, she cried at the top of her lungs, "We lost him!" She rushed toward him like a Mack truck and Hazey could barely understand her rush of agonized words. "Iwentouttochasetheraccoons! He wasalreeadygonebythetimeIgotback!"

Off to his right, the two women who are clucking and brushing off the snow on his top-coated back are helping Dr. Obadiah to his feet. Hazey is bending over and yanking at the strings to the top of the body bag.

He has no idea who the kid is when the bag finally reveals its contents. It's a young man, a boy really, perhaps in his early twenties. He is pale as ash. Slightly acne-spotted with a sparse beard and expensively orthodontured teeth. His lips are pulled back in a grinning rictus of death.

THIS WAS NOT OLD GIRL'S usual wanting and hoping and scheming to die; this was garden-variety flu or hanta virus or Norovirus, or possibly, if she was lucky, the plague.

In her feverish-and-chilled dreams, a far off siren howled like a raging baby. The mwah-MWAH-mwah-MWAH worked its way under the blankets and the longer she tried to ignore it, the louder it got till it sounded like it was screaming in the sheets with her.

She finally gave up on sleep and peered through sleep-crusted eyes through a crack in the blind. She wasn't crazy. A red fire truck filled up most of Healing House's circular driveway.

Feeling week as a kitten, she clawed the heaviest Pendleton blanket off the bed and wrapped it around her shoulders Indian-style.

By the time she crept the length of the hall, using the wall to steady her, firefighters in blue and neon-striped uniforms were boiling through the entryway.

All she could think in her addled state was that the arsonist was back. She couldn't smell a damn thing through her clotted sinuses. Where was the fire? The axes and hoses? Why weren't they evacuating Healing House?

A dozen or so large men milled around the living room watching two firefighters who seemed to be trussing a boy on the carpet. They were packing him like a sausage in something white and waxy like the paper they used at the meat locker.

A woman and a man herked and jerked a white sack thing up and over a pair of skinny legs. Adidas-clad striped feet, then hipster jeans-clad legs, then a Bard College sweatshirt that had seen better days, disappeared in a white sac. Just before the female, who was wearing a Kevlar vest, cinched a knot tight over the head, Old Girl glimpsed a white angular face with a scraggly van Dyke on the chin. Nobody she recognized. Old Girl had witnessed some weird stuff on the plaid couch that was front and center in all kinds of peer group shit, but seeing the face of stranger disappear into a body bag had to be the weirdest.

Margaret, encircled in the arms of a firefighter, kept stuttering. "I tried\--I tried---I tried." Her next words came out in a anguished rush---"hisheartwouldn'trestart!"---and the bearded man patiently kept pat-a-pat-patting her broad back. The man-sized red plaid shirt had rucked up to her waist, calling attention to Margaret's square and motherly ass.

"How long did you do compressions?" asked the fireman.

"Twenty? \-- I don't know. Twenty-five minutes?"

Margaret sniffed, her red eyes bleary. "I called in to dispatch, then rolled him onto the floor."

"He was on the couch when you found him?"

"Out cold when I came in from those fucking raccoons."

The front door was propped open to the snow-humped lawn. Cold air made the entry a refrigerator and Old Girl felt the chill reaching out towards her.

She inadvertently moaned and Margaret's head jerked up from the firefighter's shoulder. "Oh, honey, you shouldn't be out of bed!" she cried.

Margaret abandoned the firefighter. She made right for Old Girl. "Don't come in here! You don't need to see this," she was saying, as the white oblong bag rolled out the door on a gurney like some mystery that could never be explained.

Margaret's meat-packer arms went out and the next thing Old Girl knew---she, who never allowed herself to be manhandled, who always shied away from human contact---Old Girl found herself enfolded onto Margaret's bosom. With her nose pushed into the vee between Margaret's size Double-Ds, she could smell Tide and cinnamon and dog.

Margaret's body heat seemed to fuel a crack in the frozen lake of Old Girl's heart. She listened to the steady lub-lub-lub of Margaret's heart, amplified by the great breasts pressed up against Old Girl's ears like two flesh-and-blood conch shells. Instead of feeling smothered, as she expected, she was shocked at how safe she felt.

What could she do? Old Girl leaned into Margaret's pillowy heat, away from the cold air blasting in from the Idaho winter, and she let Margaret pat her back with warm, chapped hands.

RUSTY IS HAVING AN OUT-OF-BODY experience. All the pictures he got developed at Skaggs are spread out over the workbench in his trailer. A trouble light is clamped to the bench so he can see exactly what the claw saw on its first reconnaissance mission at the nut house.

It is like having a seeing eye dog except you don't have to feed it or listen to it whine when you chain it to a tree and forget to give it water.

Twenty or so 5 x 7 images of a darkened bedroom. No goddamned way to use the goddamned camera flash \-- too goddamned bright. The asshole kids slept like the dead but it was too risky if the little twats woke up. So some of the pictures left a lot to the imagination.

A white tee shirt with the words \"Trust me I\'m a doctor\" came out okay. A drawer full of pale undies all twisted up with each other like they were having sex was a disappointment.

It wasn\'t at all what he imagined the claw being able to do. It should have dragged one of the lacy panties up by the crotch and laid it out flat so he could have the picture of the thong and a pale triangle of see-through fabric that had recently held warm skin.

Since so many of the photos were dark, Rusty had to turn his mind inward to imagine the path of the seeing eye.

Instead of grainy dark blobs and shadows, Rusty imagined seeing exactly what the camera saw when the claw traveled the dorm room of two sleeping girls.

Long blond hair spread like a veil over one pillow. A hand curled open, relaxed and open in sleep. Pink lips open and gleaming behind white, perfect teeth. A liquid promise of pink tongue.

If luck was with him \-- and since he was in his mind, luck could be anything he wanted \-- the covers would magically draw back. She'd be so hot. She would shuck off her sheets and be wearing the tee shirt she\'d wore the first time he saw her. She'd be lying on her stomach with the shirt rucked up under her. The globes of a soft ass like moons rising to greet him.

He would snake the camera towards her. Click. It would travel like silk up the back of her thighs until click \-- click \-- click it found the dark pleasure of the cleft.

A honk outside the trailer jerked him back to the reality of the grime-covered worktable with its awls and rasps and acetylene canisters and nuts and screws and bolts. He gathered up the snap shots and dropped them into the paper bag he used for garbage.

He was going to have to part with some auto parts. A better goddamn camera. A high-speed lens. But first, he had to deal with the asshole who wanted to use the dump.

AFTER THEIR FIRST COFFEE DATE, Lydia and Lorenzo started meeting at the cafeteria during the 10 o\'clock break between classes.

They both saved up their change and made a show of buying the other one\'s coffee like it was a four-course meal. He was broke; she was broke. It felt even-Steven but also fair, which was quite a switch for Lydia whose Jewish grandmother had drummed into her that a lady lets the gentleman pay. It was true that Lorenzo was the gentlest man she\'d ever met.

It was on one of the days that she paid that she asked him how his family threw him out.

\"I don\'t think you\'d understand,\" he said. \"It\'s a Mormon thing.\"

\"Did you break some rule? Have sex with the minister\'s daughter?\"

\"We have deacons.\"

\"The deacon\'s daughter then?\"

\"Nothing like that.\" He stirred more sugar in his coffee \-- he\'d already dumped in two packets, and added a third.

\"Source of nutrition?\" she pointed at the stack of empty packets.

\"Got a sweet tooth that won\'t quit.\"

\"Tell me,\" she said. \"I\'m not going to judge you.\"

\"It\'s not you I\'m worried about,\" he muttered.

The one thing Lydia had learned in the hours and hours of individual therapy and group grope was that talking about your hurts, as horrible and flesh tearing as it was, did make you feel better. Not immediately, of course. Not while you were trying to endure the feeling of being flayed down to your subcutaneous flesh only to see that you were seething with maggots. But later, you inched forward. The maggots graduated to blowflies and maybe you got a glimmer that they might eventually fly off.

\"So I told you I grew up in Utah. A little town called Hilldale.\"

She didn\'t know Hilldale from Hialeah but the name seemed important to him.

\"It\'s a plural marriage community. One of the early Mormon settlements when Joseph Smith and the prophets settled in Salt Lake. It was kind of a splinter group that broke off from the main church when the stake cracked down on multiple."

Lydia sat forward on her chair. She wished she\'d paid more attention in American History back in Grosse Point but she\'d been more interested in boys from about 13 on. "Are you talking about polygamy? Like one guy and a bunch of women?\"

\"Not usually a bunch. More like two or three depending on how wealthy the man is.\"

\"What does money have to do with it?\"

\"If a man marries two or three wives, he\'s got to be able to pay for their housing and food and take care of the kids. My real dad died when I was little. So my mom remarried when I was 11 to a man who already had three wives and 23 kids.\"

\"Wow.\" All Lydia could think of was that you'd have to have a hella-big dining room table to seat that many people.

\"His name is Lorenzo Herriman\--and he\'s a son of a bitch.\"

She\'d never heard a swear word come out of Lorenzo\'s mouth. It seemed to underline his attitude to his mother\'s husband.

\"What\'d he do?\"

\"When I was 17 I got friendly with a girl he had his eye on. He threw me out the day I turned 18. He said it was because I was legal, but he just wanted to get me out of \_\_\_\_ so I didn\'t get in his way.\"

\"Hold up a second,\" Lydia said. \"Lorenzo\'s got four wives, including your mother? And he wanted another one? The guy\'s like, what? Forty? Fifty? And he\'s got four women and now he wants a 15-year-old. That\'s sick.\"

\"You don\'t understand...\"

\"I understand plenty. He's a horn dog. God, can you imagine having sex with a 50-year-old? That\'s disgusting!\"

Lydia was thinking of her mother's latest ex-husband, Floyd. He had a dropping 50-year-old body\--she\'d seen him with his shirt off, piloting his big yacht with a highball in one hand, wearing a captain\'s hat, his man-boobs separated by a silvery patch of silver back gorilla hair. She shuddered.

\"You\'re going to be 50 at some point,\" Lorenzo laughed at her. \"It\'s not the end of the world.\"

\"I hope it\'s the end of sex,\" she said.

Lorenzo looked away from her, a pink flush creeping up his cheek. Mormons, she thought. They have fifty million kids and what? It\'s the virgin birth? \"So who was the girl your stepfather had an eye on?\"

\"Orphah was my cousin. On my mom\'s side.\"

\"Eww. Isn\'t that a little incestuous?\"

\"Half of Hildale is related to each other,\" Lorenzo said. \"Most of the families go way back to the 1850s. It was a big deal when they outlawed plural marriage back in the day. That\'s why they broke off from the main church and became FLDS.\"

\"FLDS? What\'s that? It sounds like Noah\'s Ark. Flood? Get it?"

\"You\'re a nut,\" he said. \"A funny nut. FLDS stands for Fundamentalist Latter Day Saint. We\'re the cast-offs of the Mormon religion.\"

He was silent.

\"It must be hard," she said.

\"You have no idea." With his little Charlie Brown crinkly smile, he didn\'t remind her of the evil Jack-in-the box anymore. He looked like a big, lonely red-headed boy with big feet and a broken heart. Usually she associated big feet with a big dick, she realized. Was she becoming more mature without even knowing it? Nah, she thought. It would take more than that for the daughter of a cougar to change its spots.

Lorenzo shrugged. \"I was surplus, so he gave me \$100 and put me on a Greyhound bus to Salt Lake City.\"

\"What\'d your mom do?\"

\"You don\'t understand. When you go into a plural marriage, the man is God. You\'re sealed forever.\"

\"Sealed? What does that mean. Locked up?"

\"No, sealed like in a religious ceremony. It\'s a fundamentalist Mormon thing.\"

\"How\'d you get to Couer D'Alaine?"

\"One of Mom\'s cousins lives in Sand Point.I stayed with him and his family for a couple months but he lost his job. I was making it hard for them.\"

He finished the last sip of coffee and stood. \"Now you know why I drink coffee. I kind of lost my faith along the way.\"

Lydia didn\'t know what to say. The story was so astonishingly surreal. Lorenzo might as well have told her he\'d been abducted by aliens and then jettisoned over Coeur d\'Alene in a parachute.

\"Do you talk to your mom now?" she asked.

\"Not a lot. When I can afford to call,\" he said.

Lydia felt the weight of a Judith Lieberbag she'd been holding on her lap. It was sequined with cut crystal beading, about as out of place in Idaho as a Rolls Royce. Every other girl at North Idaho Community College carried Juicy Couture or maybe Michael Kors knock-off bags and Lydia minced along with a bag that cost more than most of them made in a year at Target.

It was shaped like a cat, a Cheshire cat with a white toothed, diamond-studded smile, and she's stolen it from her mother\'s closet. She doubted her mother even missed it \-- probably not since she had about twenty Judith Lieber bags plus an impressive array of Badgley Mischkas and Bottega Venetas and Pradas and every other designer you could name.

Once Lydia made the mistake of saying to Old Girl, \"Hey, I\'ve got a kitty purse, too.\" Old Girl set her scuffed and worn Hello Kitty backpack next to the shiny grinning cat . It looked even dirtier and bedraggled next to the Judith Lieber bling. \"Oh look what the cat drug in,\" Old Girl said. \"A dead kitty.\"

Lydia amazed herself by pushing the bag across the table. "This is worth a lot. Maybe you could sell it."

He looked at the cat like it might claw him. "I couldn't!"

"Why not?"

"Cats make me sneeze," he said. "I'm allergic."

"I'd give you Benadryl but the pharmacy only takes cash."

"Not cats?"

"Take the fucking bag, Lorenzo."

MARGARET'S ALARM WENT OFF LIKE a gunshot and she slapped it into silence. Thank God, Hank, who\'d tossed and turned and been up and down half the night, settled back into the flannel sheets with a snore. As usual, he was sitting up to sleep because his back hurt too much to lay flat. Mouth open, air whistling in the back of his throat, he looked half dead in his stupor. Margaret couldn\'t remember when he\'d gotten gray. In her mind, her husband went from a laughing, burly man with a nearly constant hard-on to a gray face of pain within a week of torquing his back.

In the dark of the upstairs bedroom, she pulled on pants and a flannel shirt and heavy wool socks. She tiptoed down the wooden stairs carrying her son Lloyd's old packs, trying to be fifty pounds lighter over the squeaky treads.

She set out the cereal boxes and brought the milk in from the Pleasant Meadow delivery box and muttered "Dammit" under her breath because she\'d forgotten to put the empty milk bottles out last night. Hank used to put the bottles out like clockwork but now that he was so heavy into Dilaudid, he was lucky to remember his own name. When he was seeing double in the hospital, Margaret finally got him to laugh by saying, \"If my butt is looking bigger, it\'s only the drugs.\"

While she boiled water for instant coffee, she ate at the sink standing up and thought about her to-do list at work.

It was like the list of work to be done at home. It grew like beaver's teeth and if she didn\'t chip away at it, it would eventually outgrow her ability to choke it down.

Pain changed brain chemistry, she remembered the spine doctor saying when he showed the two of them the x-rays of the narrowing in Hank's spinal column. Stenosis. It was pinching the nerves.

She kicked her way across the cow field through snow crust hauling a 5 gallon bucket of water to the trough so the heifers could get a drink. They hovered around her dim shape in the dark, smelling of manure and alfalfa that she\'d forked out of the hayrick. \"Hey, boss. Hey boss." She crooned her way through them with another bucket.

She cupped dog food into the bowl with her bare hands. Chip, the border collie, was Hank's dog and he whined at her knees pushing his nose into her crotch which was as close as Margaret was going to get to being touched there until after Hank's surgery. \"You're pathetic, she told herself. What kind of sad sack enjoys being goosed by a dog?

By the time she left for work, she\'d dry-mopped the kitchen, put away the dishes in the rack, and turned on the crock pot for the Hungarian goulash with potatoes she grew in her garden last summer. Hank had been able to spade the clods of dirt so she could pick out the spuds that were sitting on the kitchen counter waiting to be scrubbed. She\'d left them for her husband, knowing he\'d enjoy helping her with something he could do standing up.

Her eyes felt like sandpaper after her restless night. But there was no way she\'d sleep in the spare bedroom and abandon her husband to his pain. About the only solace they had was hip to hip in the flannel sheets. The sound of each other\'s breathing in the dark. It was something.

How were they going to pay for surgery? Without Hank\'s nursing income, things were tight as it was. They had insurance but it was shitty. A deductible that would choke a horse. Maybe if she could talk Hazey into full time hours they\'d give her benefits. Dental coverage! Vision care! She couldn\'t help laughing at her younger self when all she could think about was getting in the back seat of Hank\'s Dad's Buick. How the mighty are fallen over crappy insurance.

To top it off, Hazey\'s derelict old van crapped out on the way into town to take the kids to NICC. Fuck a duck. Nine kids and Margaret waited by the side of the road an hour for Triple A.

Gretchen came and picked up four of the kids in her little tin-can Pinto, a winter hazard in the snow that confirmed for the millionth time that getting a college degree didn't have a damn thing to do with common sense. How they got Big Paul into the back seat was a mystery.

James and Lydia and Rachel all had late classes so Margaret kept them behind with Reza, the math wizard who could miss all his classes and still get As.

Luckily, her son Charlie was off work so she called him and he came by in his new SUV and loaned it to her, so she could get the rest of the kids to school. Charlie said he\'d stay with the van and ride in with the tow truck driver.

\"Thanks, honey. You\'re a good kid.\"

\"Raised by the best,\" he said. "Plus you\'d beat my ass if I wasn\'t.\"

Her last view of Charlie in the rear view mirror showed him spraying the windshield of the filthy van with the Windex she kept in between the seats. She hadn\'t had a chance to clean it and the windshield glass was filthy because Hazey was too cheap to let them take the company cars to the car wash more than once a month.

No surprise. Lydia commandeered the front seat of the SUV, calling "Shot gun!". She screamed at the top of her lungs when she pulled a CD from the case Charlie kept in the pocket well. \"Macklemore! OMG, I\'ve died and gone to heaven!\"

Lydia cranked Charlie's sound system up to Def-Con Five. A drumbeat like the pulse of a giant heart lifted the car off its shocks.

Margaret liked music. She thought Inner Horizon's rule about making the kids "deplug from constant stimulation" was stupid. What would a little music hurt? she was thinking, about the time a rapper's insistent voice took over the pulsing beat. Maybe Hazey was right about rap. The stabbing voice, the hand jabbing gestures, those boys who waddled duck-legged to keep their pants from falling down around their ankles!

Meanwhile, Reza began to declaim word for word with the rapper. The other kids hollered and clapped and shook their fists in the air.

So this is how to channel ADHD, Margaret thought.

"Labels out there now they can't tell me nothing. We give that to the people. Spread it across the country." Reza and the rapper rattled in perfect sync.

And then the voice shifted from rap-shout to actual singing and everybody in the car lifted their voices and joined in. James, Lydia, Rachel and Reza sang at the top of their lungs to an anthem that even Margaret tapped her toes to. "...this is the moment. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us, like the ceiling can't hold us!"

The skirmishes with Gretchen, Margaret's disappointments and despair of Hazey, her half-irritation and half-sorrow at Lydia's hangdog face and Old Girl's down-turned mouth began to recede and Margaret, who loved music, went from an insane desire to turn off the sound system to an even more incendiary desire to leave it on and scream with the singer when he called, "This is the moment. Put your hands up! Like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us!"

Rachel, who was soft-spoken and quiet, sang in a clear bell-like voice. \"Can we go back, this is the moment/Tonight is the night, we\'ll dance till it\'s over.\" Reza and James chanted with her. \"So we put our hands up, like the ceiling can\'t hold us, like the ceiling can\'t hold us.\"

They barreled along between snow-covered meadows ringed with blue trees. Underneath new, grippy tires, the road was bare and wet, with no ice to worry about, so Margaret could relax and let go of the feeling she was taking the life of the kids in her hands in that rattle trap van. She cranked the heat up to high to thaw everybody out after their hour\'s wait by the side of the road. And the singing and rocking they were all doing made the Explorer seem like a little island of warmth and community with some rapper named Macklemore an integral part of their tight knit group.

When Lydia hopped out at the Student Union drop-off, she surprised the hell out of Margaret by saying "Thanks" and smiling with both eyes and teeth. "See you at three," she said.

Who knew Lydia actually knew the time of pick-up because she'd never been there on time in her life.

Then Reza and James and Rachel climbed out and James handed Rachel her back pack, like a knight, and before James slammed the door, he stuck his blond head back into the car, all six-feet of surfer beauty, in that moment between youth and adulthood when he would never be more beautiful, and said, "Thanks for the sing-along. You're the best."

Margaret put the SUV in drive and cruised back to Healing House feeling like she'd finally done something right. She punched track 2 and the rapper---hecalled himself Macklemore?---sang out, "Ay, Ay, Let's go!"

Margaret belted at the top of her 53-year-old lungs, \"like the ceiling can\'t hold us\" every time the chorus came around.

"ARE YOU, LIKE, THE ONLY BLACK person in Idaho?" James asked Josh, his therapist on the day he was supposed to read his Impact Letter to his parents.

Dr. Joshua Isaiah Samuelson, Ph.D, to the world, and Josh to James, raised one eyebrow. "There's my wife."

James wanted to waste time until his parents called in on the conference line. "One time I saw you walking downtown and people turned around to look at you so fast you could hear the wind whip through their ears."

"Feeling anxious, are you?"

To say James would rather swallow glass than read his Impact Letter was putting it mildly.

"I'll be on the hot seat soon enough. Seriously, don't you feel weird being different?"

Josh shrugged. "Anybody different always stands out."

James, blond, blue-eyed, basketball-fit, would have fit right in with the Aryan Nation headquartered at nearby Priest Lake, Idaho. Still, he wouldn't have been surprised to learn that there was a secret Inner Horizons pheromone that telegraphed "misfit!" to anyone who came within a hundred yards of him. Was that how the Mormon polygamist's wives felt?

Yesterday, he had seen two young blond girls, at the most 15 or 16, shopping at Rexall Drug in long pioneer dresses. Both girls had strange Elvis-type pompadours over their foreheads that cascaded into intricate rolls of braided hair down their backs. James couldn't figure out the physics of the braids. If he'd had a sister who was into hair dressing, instead of calculus, he would have asked her how they did it. \"Any advice on how to get through this?"

"Tell the truth. Be real."

James was unconvinced of the value of reality; he'd been successfully avoiding it for years. Duh-DUT. Duh-DUT. Duh-DUT. Somebody with a sick sense of humor had reprogrammed the conference phone to play the theme song from "Jaws." Last week it had played "Somewhere Over the Rainbow."

"Hi, sweetheart!" Dr Ida, James's mother sounded fakely cheery today unlike last week's ice queen. Dad growled, "Hey Bud." His old pet name for James. James couldn't remember the last time he'd used it.

"Hey." It was only one little word but the sound came out of James half strangled, as if his vocal cords were already seizing up.

Josh laid down the ground rules. James had spent the last few weeks working on *his* Impact letter, a response to the Impact letter Dr. and Mr. Olson had written detailing the events that led up to sending James to Inner Horizons. That's when James had learned the hard way the *real* reason they called it an Impact Letter: the heinous stuff his parents said he'd done hit him like a rain of stones. Now that the lacerations had finally scabbed over, James was supposed to open them back up by "taking ownership of his behaviors." Inner Horizons. Where they flayed your skin off an inch at a time.

Josh nodded at him: Put neck (A) into guillotine (B).

"Mom and Dad, there's been a lot of lying." His words came out low and mumbled, but at least they were out there. He'd lied to them both so many times he couldn't remember telling them the truth.

"Sometimes I stole stuff to get money for drugs." Throat clearing from Dad. Was he thinking about the time James crawled into their bedroom on his stomachso he could empty the wallet Dad kepton the dresser? "Occasionally, I also brought drugs into the house." Translation: every day, every hour, every minute he could get his hands on anything psychotropic.

"Excuse me, honey. When you say you stole from us, are you talking about taking Grandpa's coin collection?" Dr. Ida interrupted James' concentration.

"Or the house money?\" Dad asked.

Hey, if they could put Tylenol on the grocery list, why not uppers? Downers? James thought.

Dad said, "I wonder if you could talk specifics. Saying you stole from us is kind of general."

Stay above the surface, he told himself. The only way to get through the quagmire was to hop from one bobbing hummock to another; if he stepped in the quicksand of explanation, he'd sink over his head in slime. Tonelessly, he answered, "Both."

"Your mother thinks you've been writing prescriptions and signing her name. " Dad pressed on.

Poke me with a sharp stick and I poke back: The ancient path of their fights, deep as a wagon rut, opened before James like a well-known thoroughfare. "Cut me some slack here! Can't you give me some credit? I'm trying?"

Josh interjected in a calm voice. "I didn't hear your dad accusing you," he said, to James. "He was just asking you to clarify."

Clarify that I'm a disappointment. Clarify that I'm a liar and a thief and a fuck-up was what James heard. He looked down at the list of behaviors he had painstakingly written and rewritten. He was maybe three admissions into a list that ran single spaced down both sides of his paper. He clarified doggedly on. "There was lot of school skipping."

Dr. Ida's turn. \"Are you going to answer Dad about forging prescriptions? Do you know I can get fired for that?\"

All of Josh's coaching sloughed off like a layer of soggy tissue. James didn't dare open his mouth, because if he did, his voice would crack and there'd be no holding back the howl that wanted to be heard. Before Josh could stop him, James reached over and punched the off switch to the phone. A dial tone droned over the speakers. An EKG machine no longer able to register a pulse.

"What's the use?" asked James.

"I'm not the one who feels like the only black person in Idaho," Josh said. "You do."

26\.

OLD GIRL WORKED OFF AND ON all day on her *Animal Farm* paper. It took forever because *Animal Farm* was like a fairy tale compared to the *Lord of the Flies* shit that went down that day.

Three feet of snow had dumped on the Idaho panhandle in twenty-four hours. Even in Coeur D'Alene, where there was one snowplow for every other car, they couldn't clear the roads. Classes at NICC got cancelled. Hardly any of the staff made it in to work so Gretchen and Darlene decided to herd everybody into the living room so that they could keep an eye on them while they tried to do their regular chores.

"It'll be like going from man-to-man to zone defense in basketball," Gretchen said.

"Too bad it's WWA Wrestling," said Darlene.

Princess Danny, queen of the bulimics, and Reza staked a claim to the entire plaid couch. Danny, a volleyball forward before she got kicked out of Ohio State, stretched out all six feet of her like an Amazonian while Reza augured his weaselly self deep in the corner.

James and Rachel colonized the flowered couch until Lydia joined them and then every other chair and love seat and rocker got dibbsed. Old Girl, who was late, had to sit on the orange shag rug, using the plaid couch as a back rest while she wrote.

It was a ten page per. Thirty percent of her English lit grade. The assignment was to pick some current event from the newspaper and make up an allegory from it using George Orwell's animals. Help me God.

She had read *Animal Farm* before she entered the Program. She didn't like the fable then and she didn't like it any better when she read it again last week. What bothered her was how stupid the farm animals were in the face of relentless tyranny. The persecution of the animals depressed her and she hated how they wouldn't act in their own behalf.

Not unlike how the inmates behaved at Inner Horizons when Darlene announced the snow day.

Then it was a free for all right off the Nature Channel. People staked out their territory and spread themselves out as far as they could in what amounted to a land grab. Gorillas and cobras reacted to an enemy by making themselves look big. It worked in the jungle, so why not at a nut house?

Within the first half hour, the living room looked one of those Wall Street occupier settlements. People dragged in blankets and pillows, baskets of laundry, school notebooks, Pysch 101 and World History and Sociology and Economics textbooks and crib notes and every DBT worksheet they could find; they piled up letters, photographs, scrapbooks, Sharpies of every color, plus stacks of old Self and People Magazine. Reza dragged in his comic book collection and then refused to allow anyone to read them. James worked on overdue shop project and proceeded to hammer little nails while he wasn't stinking up the room with airplane glue .

Darlene ran her regularly therapy sessions out in the hall. For ten minutes every hour, she came in and tried to get them to play games. She started the group out with Monopoly and they played it for ten minutes until Danny and Reza lobbied for Twister. Then Twister got out of hand with too much grab-ass and screaming and Gretchen marched in and made them replace it with Parcheesi. By the time they worked their way through Risk, Trivial Pursuits, Battleship and Checkers, Big Paul got mad at all the switching and snapped the checkers board in half. That was the end of play time.

Old Girl ignored all that and doodled on her notebook pages when she wasn't chewing on the end of her pencil. You were supposed to place all the characters from *Animal Farm* into a setting of your choosing and explain how they worked in your allegorical world. Professor Larson used the country of Myanmar as the example. Old Burma's repressive military regime was a stand-in for Orwell's Manor House and Myanmar's new military regime, that was apparently just as crappy and repressive as the old regime, was the new *Animal Farm*. The Rohinga escapees from Bangalore---or was it Bangladesh? Old Girl couldn't remember---became the quail chicks who got trampled underfoot by a country of sheep. And so on.

It would have been a hell of a lot easier to do the English paper if Inner Horizons would let Old Girl read a newspaper or watch the news on TV. The last current event she was aware of was Idaho's record snow.

She'd put the paper off till the day before it was due. She'd planned to hole up today in the NICC library for research and then pound out a paper in two hours. She was good at pulling stuff out of her ass. Fucking snow day. Now without access to the Internet, she had to make allegory out of some story she already knew.

She supposed there was an argument for allegorizing the stuff that went on at Healing House. It was kind of interesting to imagine what it would be like if Darlene, their own little Napoleon, overthrew Dr. Hazey.

A red Parcheesi pawn flew hit James in the forehead and when he threw it at her and she tossed it under the couch, the Parcheesi heads set up a hue and cry until she hauled it out of the dust bunnies and threw it back to Paul.

Hazey wasn't exactly power mad; he was just weak. People like Darlene who had a God-complex took advantage of his weakness; she was good at making it look like she was acting on the founder's behalf when she was really following her own agenda. Maybe Dr. Hazey *was* like the old Tsar of Russia. Bumbling. Lexus driving and out-of-touch. A leader who couldn't function without a passle of overworked serfs.

Old Girl scribbled "Margaret = Boxer, the overworked horse." The woman was as strong as a Clydesdale and sometimes, particularly when she smiled, she even looked kind of horsey. Clearly, she'd never been to an orthodontist. Maybe braces didn't exist when Margaret was a kid.

She added to her list. "Outside = Sugar Candy Mountain."

On the farm, Sugar Candy Mountain represented the animal's idea of heaven. It seemed like Orwell was making the case that paradise was some stupid concept whose only role was to pacify the masses. Old Girl could make the same case for Outside or Where You Ended Up When You Ran which was Inner Horizon's definition of paradise. If you listened to all the kids who were constantly making plans to run away, it sounded like you got to eat ice cream and steak every day on the Outside. All the money you needed to pay for food or clothes or rent somehow magically ended up in your wallet. Police didn't exist. Neither did pimps or gangs or crack addicts who would roll you just for fun Outside. What a complete crock.

When Gretchen called them to lunch, Old Girl had made some minor progress.

Dr. Hazey = Farmer Jones, former owner of the Manor House = Tsar Nicholas of Old Russia

Darlene = Napoleon the pig = leaders of the Communist revolution

Margaret = Boxer, the hardworking horse that gets sent to the knacker

Gretchen = Squealer = Communist propaganda machine

Or

Gretchen = Snowball = Napoleon's helper who wants to overthrow the current government

Lydia = Rose, the vain horse who collects hair ribbons and wants to eat sugar all day.

Lunch was some inedible stew thing with floating chunks of unidentifiable meat. Lydia picked out a piece of gristle and told people an ear had landed in her bowl. Once that idea got going, there was a major run on the bathroom. Everybody remembered the day Gretchen fed them a casserole that she said was "fiber-rich" and half the house got the runs. The "super-vitamin stew" was what decided Old Girl on switching Darlene's role from Napoleon, the pig dictator, to Squealer, the farm's propagandist. She thumbed through her paperback copy of *Animal Farm* and highlighted the speech Squealer gave the animals in Chapter 3 on why the pigs deserved the best food.

[\"Comrades!\" he cried. \"You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for YOUR sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.\" (3.14)]{.underline}

Jackpot! she thought. Squealer was good at turning black into white and Gretchen was even better at turning shit into stew.

The only break in the day was around 3 pm when Josh, the one staff member with four-wheel drive, dropped Essie off from Stabilization. He'd taken pity on her since she'd been stuck in isolation for two weeks. He commandeered both Gretchen and Darlene to half-shove, half- drag Essie from the car to the living room.

Essie, deep in a haze of Seroquel or Ziprexa or whatever anti-psychotic they used at Stable to calm her down, lolled head-down between them in a state of near catatonia. They tried to lay her out on Danny's couch but Danny had a shit fit and wouldn't share so they finally eased her into half-sitting half-slumping on the carpet next to Old Girl.

Nobody would say why Essie had been locked up at Stable so long. Usually they took you out of general circulation and stuck you there for two or three days, max. The rumor was that Essie went postal on Ethan, the Dialectical Behavior therapist, and clocked him between the ears with a boot. Privately, Old Girl thought she was brain damaged. She'd come into the Program not long after Old Girl came to Adolescents. She'd been in a horrible car accident. An angry scar zippered from one eyebrow to her ear, though over a couple years, it had faded from an angry red to a livid pink.

Everybody at Healing House hated her.

She had no sense of personal boundaries. Worse, she didn't like to bathe. Plus she lumbered with an odd, halting shuffle and it was embarrassing to be seen with her.

Once, when Old Girl went to a dentist with her, Essie couldn't wait to get in the office to pee. She dropped trow in the parking lot. A car stopped at a stoplight honked when they got a load of that big white moon of her ass.

"Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Get away from me!" Danny started picking on Essie the minute Darlene's back was turned.

Essie, who sat a couple feet from Old Girl, roused herself but when she scooted in Reza's direction, he crossed two fingers at her like a vampire's cross. "Don't you dare! !" The little shit stuck his feet out to block her way until she gave up and slumped down in the same place and nodded off.

Old Girl usually ignored her. She wasn't a motor mouth like Reza or a whiner and a bully like Danny. Mostly Essie kept to herself, staring at the carpet or muttering under her breath. Today, though, in her zombified sad-sack state, Old Girl could smell her an astringent e medicinal smell emitting from her pores. It was hard to even look at her. Bad enough to carry Old Girl's sorrows on her own back without burdening herself with Esty's.

"Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass, Essie. What does that make me?" Reza asked.

She semi-roused herself and muttered, "Dunno."

"A smart ass!" Reza crowed.

Dumb ass, Old Girl wanted to say but contemplated her list instead, while she rolled her pencil in her mouth and tried to find a smooth part of wood to crunch on.

"Danny = Dog Pack Leader" came to her in a sudden thought. But then, if Danny had the big bark and the chomping teeth, who was Reza? He was more like a neurotic bad-tempered Chihuahua. Needle-sharp teeth in five pounds of dog shit.

On a roll with the dog pack idea, she drafted a terrific paragraph about Danny and her bitches; then she went on to draw a detailed comparison between Lydia and Rose, the vain horse in *Animal Farm* who only cared about eating sugar and collecting colorful ribbons to braid in her mane. Lydia's mammoth collection of Judith Lieber and Balenciaga handbags equaled the horse's fixation with silk ribbons and bows. All the bulimic episodes with candy and donuts lined up perfectly with Rose the horse's sugar jones.

She ran into a road block when she tried to figure out what to do with James. He wasn't a sheep. He wasn't a pig. His basketball player height made her think of a giraffe but she couldn't find any tall creatures on Orwell's farm. She wasted time trying to connect him to the windmill the animals built and then finally dumped James as a character. Professor Larson told the class that the best allegories are three-legged dogs. If everything matches one for one, you end up with a fairy tale that no one believes.

Essie snored like a walrus for a good two hours, her head resting back on the couch, her mouth wide open. She finally shook herself awake and lumbered off to the bathroom close to the time Reza and Big Paul started an arm wrestling and kicking contest on the floor. Gretchen had left the living room to answer a phone call and Darlene was having a smoke break. Paul kicked over a pitcher of water that Gretchen had brought in to water the plants before her phone call. The carpet got soaked.

Essie came back and she immediately sat down on the wet spot like a heat seeking missile. Reza and Danny howled with laughter and Esty's brow furrowed with a dumb suffering look. What was so funny?

Reza called out so the whole room could hear him. "Stanker peed her pants and she just came back from the can."

Essie shook her head at him. "I did not."

"Then how come your big stinking ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

The room erupted in yips and hoots. Essie stood up and she turned a broad, cottage-cheesed ass to the group as she tried to peer at her behind over her shoulder. She patted at her backside which was covered with ill-fitting light beige slacks that were darkening with the spreading damp.

Old Girl had been in the kitchen one day last week when she overheard Margaret telling Darlene they needed to order a rubber sheet for Reza's bed. He'd soaked the mattress for the second time in a week. You can bet that if Old Girl had been a bed wetter, she wouldn't have been taunting someone else who couldn't control her bladder. Reza's strategy was apparently to hurt first before they could turn around and hurt him.

Hence the round of jeers that Reza invited everyone to join in.

"Essie needs a diaper!"

"Stinker!"

"Stanker!"

"Not Stanker, Tanker!"

"No, Piss Queen!"

You sure didn't came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit or you'd starve, Old Girl thought.

In Old Girl's world, there was one simple rule. Mind your own business. If you kept your head down and stayed out of the fray and talked nor engaged with anyone, you would never get hurt. The rule had seen her through two years of continuous hell. And yet watching Esty's eyes glisten with unshed tears, Old Girl's sense of decency and fair play was disturbed.

You didn't kick someone who was drugged to the gills. You didn't fuck with them after two weeks in the hell of isolation where even Old Girl had been so lonely she bawled with relief when they let her out.

At six o'clock, Darlene rang the bell for dinner and called out, "Meat loaf, yay!" to a collective groan.

Old Girl picked a set at the bottom of the table as far away from Gretchen and Darlene as possible. It took her a few minutes to figure out what Danny and Reza's new game was. They must have recruited Paul because he took up the chair across from Essie on the far side of the dining table. Danny plopped down right next to her. Reza grabbed the seat on Esty's other side.

When the meatloaf dish passed to Danny, she forked up a slice for herself, then skittered the platter across the table to Paul, who took a big serving. Paul sent the dish sliding down the table away from Essie. The potatoes arrived and Reza speared five for himself, then sent the platter off in the opposite direction from Essie. He repeated the same action when butter arrived, and Danny mirrored his action with the gray peas. The only food allowed near Essie was the spinach salad that Gretchen had been serving for the past week. The greens had passed their expiration date several days before. The big salad bowl was garnished with three microscopically thin egg slices and a few shriveled mushrooms.

"Hey, Reza, " Esty's eyes were tracking the heaping meat platter. "The meat loaf skipped me."

Reza made sheep's eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Of course you did." Danny slithered into their conversation like a snake in the grass. " Right after I passed you the spuds."

Esty's plate had no spuds. Only a midget-sized dinner roll that the Program allowed people on the "high energy protein" diet which was a euphemism for starvation rations. Skinny Reza was busy shoveling half a stick of butter onto Mt. Spudmore mounded on his plate. "What?" he said. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't."

Darlene, who was at the head of the table, sensed something amiss. She interrupted her rant to Gretchen about how she hated driving on black ice and called down to Essie. "Es, what gives? How come you're not eating?"

Essie said, "Reza won't give me any food."

Reza reached for the salad bowl and flopped a gush of dry spinach onto Esty's plate. "Have some greens, Stanker. They make your shit smell sweet."

Essie stared down with a bleak expression of hopelessness. The only piece of carb comfort on the plate was a midget-sized roll next to the glop of over-the-hill spinach. The pure hunger in her eyes was palpable. To Old Girl, it looked like she wasn't just hungry this minute; she was resigning herself to starving for the rest of her life.

Old Girl couldn't have said whether it was the despair or the acceptance on Esty's cow-like face that got her on her feet and moving briskly to Danny's side of the table. She leaned over Danny and hefted up the platter of meat loaf and marched it back to Essie. She was hunkered over her plate and Old Girl banged the half-full platter down next to her, crying, "Feed yourself! Nobody's going to do it for you!"

Reza, intending, Old Girl supposed, to shove the platter away from Essie, reached out for it but Old Girl tethered him by the wrist and forced his hand flat on the table.

"Hey, let go!"

Old Girl tightened her grip and she nodded encouragingly at Essie who already had her fork in one hand and her knife in the other. "Take what you need," she said, tipping her chin toward the meat.

While Old Girl obligingly held Reza's hand flat, Essie stabbed down with her fork and embedded the tines into the back of Reza's hand.

"Owwww!" Reza tried to bolt up from his chair but Essie threw her bulk over his torso and forearm and with both hands, drove the fork deeper into the tabletop, knocking into Old Girl and shoving her to the side.

The dining room erupted into a maelstrom of sound and motion. "Stop!" "Let go!" Crazy cunt!" "Owwwoooooo." People were shouting and plates and glasses and cutlery were crashing from Essie and Reza's thrashing. Darlene & Gretchen bolted into the fracas while Reza's screams rose in volume and a high-pitched hyena's laughter---Danny, naturally--- went on and on.

Old Girl backed away from the fray. She watched the herking-jerking bodies, all the room in motion. Darlene pushing. Gretchen shoving. James reaching across the table and yanking at Reza's arm as he tried to unearth it from Esty's bulk while Reza screamed and protested in pain.

Wow, Old Girl thought. Look at what I did! Who knew that all Essie needed to act for herself was a little help? Old Girl, so used to keeping her head down and resisting every effort to connect, was caught short by the shy sense of accomplishment that was sneaking up on her. She felt proud. As proud as if she'd defeated Napoleon and Snowball and Squealer and the pack of feral dogs with the simple act of passing a platter. Yay, meatloaf, indeed.

And because even a stabbing wouldn't get you out of Clean Up duty at Inner Horizons, Old Girl dutifully began to work her way around the table stacking dirty dishes. She avoided the newbies like Esther and Ian, who were craning for a better view, and asking who started it, and she went down the long table picking up Big Paul's plate which was picked clean and stopping to put Danny's food plate on the top of the stack because it looked like she hadn't eaten a single bite. Once she collected an armload, she hip-butted her way through the swinging door into the kitchen.

To her surprise, Danny was there ahead of her. She was standing at the counter lapping at a pie plate. The big blond girl Hoovered big bites of lemon meringue into her mouth while she held her ponytail out of the muck.

"Hey! Margaret made that pie for everybody!"

Danny continued swallowing gouts of meringue and neon yellow filling without seeming to chew. It had only been a few minutes since Essie had stabbed Reza. His piggy whimpers punctuated the buzz of voices and swearing and excited conversation that was still coming from the dining room. Yet the celebratory pie Margaret baked to feed a dozen people was almost half gone.

\"You\'re sick!\"

\"Isn\'t everybody?\" Danny smiled with a glob of filling quivering on her chin. \"Why do you think we're all locked up here? You\'re as fucked up as the rest of us.\"

> \"I\'m not! I don't bully people!"
>
> Danny scooped in a cloud of meringue. "Besides it's my pie for graduating.

"The hell you graduated! You manipulated your way out of here. Or your parents can't pay!

"So?"

"So get your face out of that pie and leave some for the rest of us."

"Make me."

Danny turned away to concentrate on the pie and Old Girl, buoyed by her success with Essie, decided she wasn't half as tough as she thought she was. Sure, Danny was taller but Old Girl, thanks to her hours on the treadmill, was in better shape. And she had the element of surprise with her.

Old Girl smacked the back of Danny's head with the flat of her palm. She forced the girl's head down to the countertop and ground her nose into the pie pan as hard as she could. Custard and meringue squirted everywhere as the girl struggled, snorting and choking and trying to pick her head up. But Gravity was on Old Girl's side. She felt the strangest sense of satisfaction come over her. She was still hungry from the interrupted dinner but for perhaps the first time in her life, she felt completely, totally satisfied.

27\.

Tell me about your friends," Darlene asked one session.

Lydia looked blankly at her, wondering what horse shit Darlene was trying to pass off as ice cream. "You mean, like in first grade?"

"Well you can start there but I was wondering who you hung out with in Grosse Point."

Darlene was convinced that her problem was a lack of social skills. "You never progressed beyond having more than one friend at a time. That's something most kids learn by the third grade."

At present, she didn't have even one friend so she wasn't sure what Darlene was basing her facts on.

"I didn't really pal around with anybody."

"No one?"  "Sometimes I went shopping with a couple of girls. Two nieces of one of Grandmother's friends who were visiting from Toronto. They came over and went through her closet discards like locusts. They liked her for what she was willing to give them, she supposed.

"How about here? Who are you close to at the Program? Usually people form attachments wherever they are."

"This isn't a very friendly place," Lydia said. "Why would you want a friend just as crazy as your self?"

Darlene shook her head. "You were written up this week for antagonizing Old Girl."

"She's a bitch. Everything antagonizes her."

"What did you do to her to get written up?"

"I drive her crazy. She says I'm a user."

"Is that true?'

Hmmm. Old Girl wanted the ottoman at Process Group so she could turn her back to the group and stare out the window. Lydia wanted to see what was so interesting about a bunch of Ponderosa trees in a yard full of drifting snow. The only sign of life she'd seen out there was a raven cawing on the fence. Nature. What a disappointment.

"It says here\--," Darlene gestured to the file on her lap, "---you two had to be separated."

"Her dreadlocks creep me out. I just wanted to see if something was growing in there."

"Was there?"

Old Girl had smelled like fabric softener and something pleasantly spicy that she couldn't identify. She hadn't tried to hurt her. Just sat put her in a leg lock until Margaret came and pulled her off and made them sit in opposite corners of the living room.

After a long moment of silence, Darlene said, "What about Essie? How's it going having her as your room mate?"

"She's a pig. She never takes a shower."

Lydia and Darlene had spent weeks arguing about why Lydia had to pick up after herself when the Program had staff for that. "We're trying to prepare you for real life."

"I'm not going to be a maid in real life," she had said. Darlene actually laughed, though she tried to cover the smile with a cough.

"There's that new girl, Rachel."

Lydia rolled her eyes. Darlene was so clueless. "She's friends with James. She's taken."

"She can be friends with more than one person at a time. This isn't second grade."

For some reason, the memory of Rebekah Israel from second grade flitted through her mind. Rebekah and Lydia had been besties all through the first half of second grade until Rebekah dumped for a tiny Japanese girl who transferred in to the Academy when her father got transferred to Zurich. How amazed she had felt when she saw Rebekah eating lunch with the girl at a different table opposite the one where Lydia and Rebekah always sat. She'd glanced around for someone else to sit with but everywhere she looked, kids were in pairs or threesomes and the only place that was free was with one of the slow kids. She'd turned away and dumped her full tray in the garage and gone to the library the rest of the year. Rebekkah had called her two or three times after that, wanting to go on a play date, but she never answered her calls. Once burned and all that.

"I've got plenty of guy friends. They all like me.:

"Sex isn't the same thing as friendship," Darlene said. "We've talked about that."

"Besides girls are catty. It's stupid to waste time on them when they're only going to stab you in the back and steal from you."

"They don't if they're really friends."

"I guess I wouldn't know."

Sigh. She was gunning for another black mark from Darlene on the daily list of black marks and warnings and infractions against recommended behaviors that were designed to keep people in the Program forever. Then it occurred to her that she did have something to drag out and display at Darlene's stupid show-and-tell.

"Actually, I made friends with a guy at NICC." She skipped the part about Lorenzo being homeless and not technically enrolled in college. What different did that make? He wouldn't have sex with her ergo, he was a friend, wasn't he?

"One of your classmates? Oh, that's good. Tell me about him."

"He's a Mormon. Kind of scruffy---but nice. He bought me a cup of coffee when I ran out of quarters."

"What'd you talk about."

"Just normal stuff. Where he lives." At the Povarello Center for recovering drunks and deadbeats. "About his dog." Also a stray with a rope leash. "He asked me on a coffee date. And he thanked me. That was weird."

"What'd he thank you for?"  Truly, it beat the hell out of her. "For an interesting conversation, I guess."

"He has good manners."

"He held the door for me when we went out." That had been a first.

What do you like about him?"

Hmmm. That was a poser. It sure wasn't Lorenzo's looks. That scruffy camouflage jacket. The ragged clown hair that needed to be cut. A curly, out of control beard. Even his freckles were homely and overgrown.

"He was interested in me. He didn't want anything. We just talked."

"Sounds promising. Will you see him again?"

"He said he'd help me study for my accounting quiz. He likes numbers."

"Are you attracted to him?" Darlene code for "are you going to fuck him?"

"No way. He's like a mountain. Or a mountain man. He's as big as a house." She grimaced. "He's got horrible freckles. And facial hair. And curly red hair that he never combs."

Darlene nodded, like go on.

"He's kind of funny. Anyway, he made me laugh."

"Promising," Darlene said. "Let me know how it goes. When do you see him again?"

"On Thursday after Sociology Class."

"Good, Lydia, that's progress." Not a checkmark at least. She could read the red + sign Darlene put at the top of her Progress Summary.

Bing-bong. Session over according to Darlene's sweet-and-smarmy ringtone. Lydia gathered up her purse and she was reviewing the contents of her closet when she went out the door. What do you wear to a coffee date? Jeans and a tight cashmere sweater? A see-through blouse and a skirt that barely covered her butt? Definitely Ferragamo boots. Boots were sexy in any kind of weather.

RUSTY WAITED IN THE CRAWL SPACE under the nuthouse alternately listening to the sounds of life going on above him in his hole and napping on the old bedspread he'd dragged in with him. He had to move away from the family room where they kept the pool table because the breaking balls reminded him of the sound of his old man breaking sticks over his head for a whipping. Nobody could sleep through that.

Under the girl's bedrooms, near the laundry room that had the crawl space that allowed access to the duct work and the pipes was quieter. The entry was blocked because some asshole had loaded a bunch of boxes marked "Xmas" on them that Rusty had to move. He made a mental note to come back for them because people were always coming to the dump looking for ornaments and fake trees.

In the quiet dark, cloistered in his own fug, he felt cocooned in his own cave. He'd been dreaming so insistently day and night in was hard to tell what happened from what was about to happen. Always the blond girl with the tight, muscular ass. Hair hanging down like a curtain. The letters on the back of her tee shirt----Poker in the Rear---were like a promise. Oh Christ in heaven she wanted it! Just the idea of seeing her in her bare legs, the tee shirt riding up the globes of her pale ass lit him up.

She was the reason he\'d loaded up a bucket of old paint rags smelling faintly of turpentine. He'd squirt them with fire starter in case they didn\'t light with the first match. He patted his vest pocket to make sure he hadn\'t just dreamed up the box of matches.

He planned to be right outside the back door when the fire call went out. He imagined her racing out in the night in bare feet and the tee shirt. A better idea struck him. Maybe he could be manning the hose and accidentally, like, spray her in the chest\--that was good. He rerolled the tape in his mind and he imagined the fire call that brought him from the back road behind the house to the side yard where he\'d be standing in the spankin' new volunteer fire department jacket he'd bought to impress her. She\'d be able to see him by the light of the flames but she\'d be almost blinded by the neon reflective tape and she\'d be standing there in the wet tee shirt with her tits all perky and Rusty would duct-tape her mouth to keep her quiet and\...

Rusty hadn\'t quite figured out the next part yet. How was he going to grab her with all the other volunteer assholes on the fire department getting in the way?

He\'d have to nab her when she barreled out the back door and before she ran out to the front yard where he\'d first seen her puking. Reluctantly, he discarded up the hose idea. Once he had her locked in the trailer he could rub her down with maple syrup and eat her with a spoon, he supposed.

The fire was just to get her out in the cold in the tee shirt. A means to an end, as the old man used to say. What an end, he thought patting the matches then starting the tape of his mind once again, her pale ass glinting in the dimness before he nodded off.

OLD GIRL'S SLEEP WAS FITFUL. A few nights before, she kept thinking she heard shutter snaps under the gray veil of uneven, dream-raddled sleep. Then, close to one a.m., she woke up smelling cigarette smoke. It wafted in from the window she couldn\'t remember leaving cracked.

She'd been dreaming about riding in the passenger seat of the blue van while Margaret was driving. The lock was beckoning to her.

Unlock me. Throw the door handle. Lean against the door panel and let gravity be your friend! She could see her body hanging by the door handle as the door swung wider. Asphalt rushed below her feet like a grey river of uneven rocks.

Just let go. Was it the thought that woke her or the smoke?

When she padded over to the window on Rachel's side of the room, the acrid smell got stronger. She yanked the sash and it banged down. She whispered, \"Sorry," but Rachel only stirred, then sighed deeper in the covers.

What would it be like to sleep all night? To wake refreshed instead of bone tired and bleary with weariness? Her dreams were always worse when she was tired. Coke machines toppling. The aspirin bottle that rattled like a snake in her Dr. Williams, her Shakespeare professor's, drawer. That afternoon, she'd fallen asleep in the van ride home with Margaret and dreamed about hooking a loose exhaust pipe up to a garden hose. That's how she knew she was dreaming. You'd never find a hose in the middle of January in Idaho where every irrigation device was put away nine months out of the year.

\"Hey, I\'m talking to you, dreamy,\" Margaret\'s voice pulled her out of danger. "How come you're so tired?"

\"Sorry. I didn\'t sleep last night."

\"Why not?\"

\"Et tu, Brute?\" Old Girl said.

\"What's that supposed to mean?\"

"It's Shakespeare for "mind your own business.\"

"Is not,\" Margaret said. \"It means, \'You too, Brutus?\"

"Why does everybody in this god forsaken place always try to get the latest dirt from me? You just want to smother me with it.\"

By then the van was jouncing into the rutted driveway.

"You need a nap,\" Margaret pronounced, like she was talking to a bratty child. She swatted her gently on the butt in an effort to herd her down the hall towards her room. \"You look like a raccoon.\"

\"Huh?\"

\"Rings around your eyes, silly. Growing bones need sleep.\"

Old Girl rolled her eyes but she felt so dead on her feet she'd laid down still in her down jacket and slept the sleep of the dead until dinner.

She decided she might as well go to the john since she was already up. She opened the door and that's when she realized the hall was foggy with smoke.

RUSTY LOOKED TOTALLY BADASS in his new uniform jacket. Double neon-yellow stripes blazed on the blue navy sleeves and they lit up his shoulders and at the hem. A Couer D'Alene County Volunteer Firefighter patch covered his heart.

He was hoping somebody would buy the Mustang parts he\'d been squirreling away and then when he had enough money socked away, he could buy the suspender pants to go with the coat. But at least nobody would see him in the jacket and think Rusty Harrow was just a candy-ass garbage hauler.

He was Rusty Harrow, officially pinged by pager to come out in the bitter cold to provide crowd control over a crowd of clucking crazies who were milling around like chickens. The experienced guys were up on the roof or manning the fire hoses and climbing the ladders to chop a hole near the dryer vent that was the fire source.

The wad of dryer fluff he found in the lint screen was like a gift. Fucked up rich kids were too lazy to clean the trap. A satisfying lick of flame traveled from his match into the cotton clumps that multiplied like cancerous tumors in the dryer\'s innards. Plenty of fuel to get this party going, he thought. Just to make sure, he gave the Rayon curtains that hung beside the tall window an extra spritz of lighter fluid.

Then all he had to do was cross a field, skirt the Ponderosas lining the perimeter, and drive a quarter mile past the crazy farm. He sat his ass in the heated truck with the heater running full blast until the pager on his belt bleeped and farted. He was all ready to tell Daly, the Fire Chief, that he\'d been on his way home which everybody knew was 5 miles past the nut house on Strenger Road before the town council figured out that putting a dump next to the Coeur d\'Alene River was not such a hot idea.

But Daly hadn\'t looked at him twice when Rusty showed. He'd just shouted, \"You! Harrow. Set up the perimeter line. Keep them kids back and keep 'em out from under foot.\" Daly had seen the new jacket but the son-of-a-bitch never said a fucking word.

He was manning the fire tape telling kids to stay back when he spotted the blond girl. Marty Oldstead was handing her a space blanket and if he could of, he'd of kicked the little shit in the nuts. Why hadn\'t he thought to bring the horse blanket he\'d just liberated from Rawlings Stable and wrapped it around the girl himself? Fucking nim-shitz, he whispered. Fucking dick-turd.

He drifted to the end of the tape where a knot of kids were stamping their feet and rubbing their hands against the cold. His girl, the tously-haired one with the long legs and udders the size of a cow, was standing at the edge of the group. Some tall asshole had his arm around her shoulders, and Rusty had to get a hold on himself so he didn\'t walk up and stiff arm the son-of-a-bitch in his ugly puss. Get your hands off! he wanted to shout. Mine!

Luckily, the girl glanced his direction and she gave him an uncertain nod, a faint glimmer of recognition in her eyes. She remembers me! he told himself. A sense of warmth stole up on him as if he'd been kidnapped and thrown in a box.

She remembers me!

OLD GIRL RAN DOWN THE GIRL'S wing screaming "Fire!" She beat on every door of the Fat Ass wing while Charlene, on Night Duty, hollered and pounded door-to-door shouting at all the Blackheads to get out.

Now they were all gathered in the front yard watching flames shoot out of the back door by the laundry room.

Only a few people had coats or blankets, though Charlene had parked herself at the front door closet and shoved anything warm at people in the mad rush to escape. Reza had wrapped a bath towel around his skinny shoulders and wore nothing on his lower half except tighty-whities.

Charlene took one look at his goose bumpy legs and shoved a puffy pink ski jacket at him from a bundle in her arms. \"Jesus, you ding bat. Put this on before you freeze your skinny ass!" Reza zipped up the short girl's jacket----Old Girl thought it might belong to Lydia----and rearranged the striped bath towel into a turban. He looked like a bare-assed Arab stranded in the snow.

Rachel was alone on the other side of the yard, watching flames lick up the siding and bawling. Old Girl assumed she'd bolted straight out to the yard after Old Girl had woken her and was busy while Old Girl was making sure everybody got out. She wasn't sure what the softie was bawling about. She'd gotten out safe, hadn't she? Old Girl herself had had no second thoughts about running away if the choice was to be burned to a crisp.

Old Girl patted Hello Kitty hanging off her shoulder to reassure herself it was still there. Her pack was the first thing she'd grabbed after she pulled her pants on. Mom gave it to her on her tenth birthday and now the kid's backpack was so small it barely fit over her shoulders. Kitty's eyelashes had worn off first and now Kitty herself was slowly being erased. Old Girl was always having to fend off Margaret's efforts to shake it in Spray N'Wash. The grime was what she liked about it. Everything once white was gray and what used to be pink or purple was an even grimmer gray and the grime seemed equal to the gray asphalt in her heart. By the time Old Girl actually managed to off herself, she imagined Hello Kitty would be black.

A volunteer firefighter was chopping a hole in the roof while others were spraying horse tails of water on smoking walls. The fire seemed to be concentrated near Old Girl's room next to the laundry room at the end of the hall, based on where the hoses were aiming.

Old Girl was about to go over to Rachel, thinking she ought to try to console her, but James beat her to it. He opened the woolen blanket around his shoulders and came up behind Rachel to wrap her in a bear hug. \"It\'s OK," she heard James saying. \"You\'re safe."

Lydia wandered by them wearing nothing but a cotton tee shirt and a pair of frog printed sleep shorts. She eyed their cozy blanket like she would kill for it.

To Old Girl\'s surprise, Rachel opened the front of her blanket and beckoned Lydia into the safety of its cocoon. "Come in here and get warm." Lydia's face! She looked like a starving person handed a piece of warm bread: equal parts shock and covetousness.

A firefight near them was stretching out a band of fire tape to keep people back. Seeing Rachel open her blanket, forcing James to do the same to admit Lydia, he stopped in his tracks. For an instant, Old Girl thought he was about to throw a wicked pair of wire cutters at James. Other firefighters were hefting ladders against the house and hooking up hoses and talking on staticky walkie-talkies to get the flames under control while this guy stood very still, radiating malevolence.

"Hey, Rusty! Get your fat ass in gear!" He backed away toward a fire truck parked cross-angled in the snow keeping his eyes focused on the three-way blanket sandwich.

Weird, she thought.

It was bitter cold. As her adrenalin burst began to wear off, it felt even colder. The malevolence on the firefighter's face made Old Girl shiver far below the down jacket and two sweaters she\'d pulled over her nightgown.

Thank God her black Snoopy hat with the long beagle ears and a ratty pompon for a nose was stuffed in her pocket. She pulled it out and Snoopy's white and black goggle eyes rolled on either side of the pompom. What she needed to do was pull off the eyeball buttons that moved when she moved and replace them with black crosses. Instant metamorphosis: pet dog to road kill. Instead, she jammed the hat over hear ears and moved away from the group so she stood alone.

She felt a whoosh of powerful wings.

The hat she'd just jammed down over her ears on was ripped off her head. One of her dreads went with it. A powerful yank. Then the dread still smarting, dropped back down and slapped her across the face.

"Wha\-\--?"

Dark wings materialized over her head. A glimpse of sharpened talons. A brief brush of wind was eerily silent. Eagle? Owl? Something dark and powerful beat silhouetted wings above the flames and landed in a grove of Ponderosa trees.

Disbelieving, she touched one hand to her head.

It was bare. Snoopy was gone.

Her scalp felt like it was on fire where the dread lock had been jerked full length. It was Gabe's baby hat. Mom gave him Snoopy for a birthday present when he turned four, shortly because the car crash. She'd taken it with her when she moved in with Uncle David and Aunt Peggy.

A light wind tossed snow crystals from the snow drifts in little heartless puffs. Her ears tingled from the cold. Deep down, in her body but nowhere she could describe, she felt the dull ache of loss.

Since the death of her family, she had meticulously pared her life to the bare essentials. Gabe's hat. The Hello Kitty backpack from Mom. Her journal. To lose Snoopy was like having one of her limbs amputated and then carrying on without a murmur.

Her immediate impulse was to throw herself into the middle of the group in their blankets and howl. Her feet were heading toward the cocoon before the thought was full formed. Hold me. Somebody take me in before I fall to my knees.

She wasn't sure but she thought she caught a glimpse of Snoopy's whirling eyes before the bird landed.

Old Girl heard a disembodied voice say, \"What the hell?\"

The crowd of refugees from Healing House wrapped in blankets, huddled in pajamas and random coats grabbed from the front hall, all turned en masse and peered up into the pines that surrounded Healing House. A light from one of the fire fighter's Maglites a played across the branches.

A pink starburst glowed near the top of the tallest Ponderosa pines. Beady black eyes set off by a narrow black mask were peering out from the face of a radioactive flower.

Another spotlight lit up another feral face in the center of an DayGlow green splat.

One by one all the radioactive colors in a nuclear rainbow dotted the dark branches like dreams from a strange nuclear vision.

\"Coons?\" one of the firefighters said.

"Jesus. Are they sick?\" somebody else said.

The sight was illogical and strange and wonderment seemed to be catching as it hopped from the stranded kids in their mismatched boots and blankets, to the firemen in their neon-striped coats that matched a yellowish glow on a starburst of the raccoons.

Half a dozen masked creatures were splattered with paint on their bellies and haunches. On one, paint ran from its shoulder down its forearm to a tiny, almost human starfish of a hand.

James, then Rachel were shouting and pointing. " Look!! There's a pink one!"

No, she wanted to cry. That's not a raccoon, it's a great horned owl!

"A purple coon!"

"Holy crap, there's a green one!"

"Coons! They're glowing. What the fuck?"

Big Paul, stunned out of his autistic silence , said in a voice of wonder, "Who turned on the Christmas lights?"

Flashlights from every fire fighter were strafing the pines, searching for the nuclear painted raccoons. In the glow of the search lights, it was easy to see the giant owl's silhouette perched on top of the tallest tree. No one except Old Girl noted it. Not when a flower garden of Day-Glo raccoons bloomed in the black trees like an show of sun dogs or the Northern Lights.

Was this what life was destined to be? Old Girl asked herself? A series of losses followed by even more losses until she herself was naked as the day she came into this world?

WTF was the only thing Old Girl could think to say.

\"DID YOU KNOW THAT FIREFIGHTER?" Old Girl asked Rachel when Charlene finally gave them the go-ahead to go back into Healing House. Once the fire was out, the firefighters closed the fire doors and blocked off the girl\'s wing. The plan was to set up a makeshift slumber party for the girls in the living room and let the boys go back to bed.

Rachel asked \"What firefighter?\"

\"He was standing next to you." Old Girl looked around and the man in the bright new jacket was gone. \"When... you know, when James gave you the blanket."

Rachel looked blank.

\"He seemed to know you,\" she said.

33\.

RACHEL ERUPTED OUT OF HER COVERS in a panic when Old Girl screamed at her and shook her awake.

Old Girl was already running down the hall while Rachel was still hopping on one leg, trying to get her socks on at the same time she slipped on a pair of pants under her nightgown. She had to paw blindly under the bed for her shoes. It was too dark to see anything. What the hell was wrong with the lights? Smoke made her cough and claw at her eyes.

Her first thought was to exit from door at the end of the hall but the smoke was even heavier there and she was choking and retching before she made it to the laundry room. She touched one hand to the wood of the closed door and jumped back from the heat.

Then she pelted toward the front door where Cheryl had stationed herself at the coat closet, simultaneously trying to check people's names off her Duty Sheet while shoving jackets at people to wear out in the cold. "Out! Get out! Go!" she was chanting.

It shocked the hell out of Rachel to see flames already licking up the wood siding from an open window at the end of Healing House. She searched the chaos of the mass exodus for Old Girl and James and then had a moment of panic when she didn't see either of them.

Sirens screamed in the distance while cars were barreling down the driveway and every kind of vehicle parked haphazardly on the lawn and disgorged men in firefighter hats and neon striped jackets. What? Idaho is too backward to have firetrucks? crossed Rachel's mind until she spotted a giant red truck wailing onto the lawn in a blaze of blue and red lights .

When she made her way across the yard to join the rest of the Healing House escapees who were gathered at the trellis, which was their assigned meeting place in any emergency, Charlene was already there before her. She was calling out names and checking them against her clipboard. When she yelled "James Olson!" and James said"Here!" she felt a little calmer.

He had been smart enough to grab the blankets off his bed while the rest of Healing House braved the January cold in tee shirts and flip-flops. Wrapped head to toe in thick Pendleton blankets, James looked vaguely Indian, except for the Oakland A's baseball cap on his head.

Rachel began a systematic search of the yard for Old Girl. It took her quite a few circuits in a growing panic to locate her missing roommate in the crowd. She finally spotted Old Girl crouched on the ground, no where near the trellis, with her backpack open in front of her.

"Where were you! !You scared the shit out of me," Rachel cried.

"I had to go back in and find my journal," Old Girl said.

" The smoke was horrible! How'd you even know there was a fire?"

Old Girl was busy pulling her black Snoopy hat out of the backpack. She jammed it over her ears. " I was dreaming and I smelled it."

"You don't smoke."

"I know. That's why it woke me up."

It was the sight of the zip locked bag of photos that Old Girl was thrusting back in the pack that was a fist to her solar plexus. Her scrap book! Flames shot from the roof above the girl's wing into the starry sky. She remembered shoving the oak drawer shut last night after looking, as she always did before she went to sleep, at a fuzzy diamond shaped computer image. She was probably the only person in the world---other than the technician who'd spread the gell ---who knew that the tiny crustacean shape in the wavy black and white Xerox was a baby.

The smiling technician. Cold gel that greased a sliding wand over her belly. She didn't even know what she was looking at until the technician pointed out the tadpole legs and a skull no bigger than a crab apple. "Sweet! Baby is sucking its thumb!"

Bits of ash floated weightless in the night sky. Then a brisk gust of wind tossed the bits of spent flame into the night to merge with a wash of milky stars that were a billion miles away like the lost infant.

Feeling sick, she envisioned the flannel sheets she\'d been swaddled in a few minutes before bursting into flame next to the oak bureau where she'd placed a scrapbook of neatly pasted photos of her mother and dad and Sammy, her brother, and Trisha Nixon, the family dog.

Rachel shivered, crossing her arms around herself. She was wearing a U of Illinois running jacket against a wind chill of -10^o^ with no cloud cover. Surprised by the light touch of James's hand on her shoulder, Rachel turned a questioning look at him and when James opened the folds of his woolen blankets, she walked right into the rightness of sharing body heat. There was nothing sexual about leaning into the wiry boyishness of her only friend at the Program; he smelled like shampoo with a light touch of stinky athletic shoe that was somehow reminiscent of her little brother Sammy's room back home.

Lydia wandered past them in a pink hoody and cotton sleeping shorts and for a second, the similarity between Lydia and her brother Sammy was uncanny. They were about the same size---two underfed middle-schoolers with wild mops of black curly hair. Lydia's legs in frog-printed cotton shorts were as goose-bumped and knobby as Sammy's when he'd snuggle up to watch cartoons in his Batman underpants.

Rachel instinctively opened her arms and she beckoned at Lydia to come into the shelter of her blanket. The look on Lydia's face was so hungry, it was almost naked with desire and fear that she would be denied. "Come on in and warm up," Rachel said. "It's a party."

She felt rather than heard James's small intake of breath and his silent laughter. Then he too opened his arms and settled the bedding he'd brought form his room around them in a three-way sandwich. Because James and Rachel were almost a head taller than Lydia, she slipped into the nest of their arms like a child.

If you had looked down on the three residents of Healing House, say from an owl's perspective perched on the highest branch of a pine that guarded the property, you would have seen two blankets and three people who needed to get warm. James stretched his blanket around Rachel, and Rachel stretched hers around Lydia and they all squeezed together for warmth and support in the moment. Which was pretty much all there was.

RUSTY HARROW, WARM AND SWEATING in his shiny neon striped firefighting jacket from hauling ass over snow drifts and rabbit holes, frowned over his fire tape at a tall blond asshole. It looked to him like the blond asshole was feeling up the ponytailed girl under cover of a blanket.

Rusty had been about to walk up to her and ask her to sit in the truck. He would blast the heat up to high and tell her he was one of the first responders on the scene--- true, since he\'d waited in the crawl Healing House space until everyone went to bed and then he brought in the turpentine soaked rags he\'d been saving.

He'd left the rags in the garbage can like somebody\'s trash. That fat girl, Charlene, who went to grade school and junior high with him before he dropped out, kept waddling back and forth into the laundry room. Every time he thought she was done folding laundry, he\'d hear her heavy tread and the witch would be back turning on a washer for another load. He finally laid down on his stomach and took a short snooze until the house was silent and still.

It worked out OK that she was too stupid to clean out the lint trap. He lit a match and watched the flame eat the cotton lint like a snake before he heard the whoosh of turpentine-soaked rags. The garbage can was burning merrily, shooting flames like reaching fingers up the curtains by the time he walked out into the night though the back door.

He\'d called in the fire on the \$35 prepaid virgin mobile phone he\'d bought, then tossed the phone in a ditch. Whatever happened to reach out and touch someone? a jingle he remembered from television. Or Mighty Mouse? You never saw ol\' Mighty or his girlfriend Minnie? Misty? anymore. She was a screamer he remembered.

His plan had been working like clockwork, until the tall kid stuck a spoke in the works, him and his fucking blanket. There was something going on under that blanket that he didn't like. Rachel was his, not the tall kid\'s. She was leaning back against his chest with her eyes closed. He doesn't see the tiny curly haired girl at all because the blanket Rachel wrapped around her covered her from head to toe. The tall kid's glance passed over Rusty, then swiveled back so that the two of them locked eyes. A little frown flit over the kid\'s face like he was wondering who the hell Rusty was. \"You\'ll know my name soon enough you piss-ant,\" Rusty told himself. "If you think she's a screamer wait till you hear yourself."

"Aren't you mad? I'd want to kill somebody." Lydia said to Lorenzo.

He was taking a swallow from the coffee cup they were passing back and forth at Grumpy Monkey Grind House on Elm Street. "It's more like I"m disgusted. Ashamed."

"You're ashamed because your stepfather is an asshole?"

"No." He pulled out a rusty clown curl and lit sprang back to mate with all the other wiry coils that haloed his head. "It's just... Mormons believe family is everything. LDS takes care of LDS. And then he turns around and drops me off in Salt Lake with a ratty suitcase and a \$100 bill? How could I have been so clueless?i I grew up up believing one thing and now I see it's a lie. "

Lydia adjusted herself in the chair, mutely aware of the safety pin digging into her thigh. If she sat one way, she could get away from its piercing fire. The trick was to continually change positions so that the pin could dig in to a new place and punish herself with sharp, and breathtaking pain.

"How come you keep squirming around?" Lorenzo said. "You look like you sat on a hockey stick."

Lydia blinked. Lorenzo would never in a million years understand why she had to punish herself for all the shit she'd done. "Oh, ha ha ha. It's this stupid chair. It's uncomfortable."

"So sit in another one." Lorenzo got up and brought another chair over from the table next to them.

"You're Mr. Polite, aren't you?"

"Manners help when you're homeless," he said. "You won't believe how nice people are when you say please for a ketchup packet that's going to be dinner."

"You're kidding." Lydia sat straighter, ignoring the pin. "Aren't you?"

The idea that Lorenzo was hungry---that he might have gone hungry last night---astonished her. She couldn't imagine someone starving in a coffees hop where people were paying four bucks for a latte and \$5.00 for a scone. In a lull in the chatter around them, Lorenzo's stomach rumbled. That confirmed it. She was sitting across from a real person who didn't have enough to eat. How was that possible in America? She leaned forward to take his hand and nearly jumped out of her chair when safety pin shifted into her crotch.

Breathe, she told herself. Swallow the heat. "Here. Sell this." To distract herself, she pushed the Judith Lieber cat bag at him, using every ounce of control to keep her butt in the chair.

He was watching her like she was sick or something. "No way. I'd never take something sp expensive."

The selfish part of her was thankful that he wasn't going to take the bag for a second. She remembered her mother buying it at Harrod's on Kensington Avenue in London and being upset because she didn't like the way the red sequins went with her cocktail dress. Eventually she gave it to Lydia when she got some lipstick on the lining and it was too much trouble to return it.

It seemed to Lydia that her was moving of its own volition when she shoved the bag to Lorenzo's side of the table. "Take it! Really, I couldn't care less about it."

Why was the pin suddenly driving her crazy? It had been minding its own business tucked in her underwear seam when she ordered their coffee and now it was on a mission to impale her most tender parts. She forced herself to sit back, away from the bag, without changing expression. Between the pain in her crotch and the pain of removing her hand from the bag, she felt like she was going to pass out. "Go ahead. Take it."

"Keep it."

Their words T-boned together with all the mayhem of a car wreck.

"Why are you being so nice to me? You don't even know me."

I know enough, she told herself. "If you take it to Luxe for Less on E. Locust, you'll be amazed what they'll give you for it."

"No way."

"It's a designer bag. It's even signed. That means it's worth more." For some reason, she was embarrassed to tell him that her mother had originally paid four grand for an evening bag. Lorenzo was wearing a faded Cabela tee shirt and army surplus camo pants. Why would he even know that such things existed in the world, much less that she belonged to it?

No. Never. Absolutely. Categorically. No. Thank. You. Homeless Lorenzo was as obdurate as a rock and he would not take the bag for love nor money. His words, not hers.

She tried reasoning with him. Luxe'll give you at least \$500. For it, no questions asked."

"I don't care."

"You're pretty principled for someone who's broke and living on the streets."

"I get paid at the end of the week," he said. "I'll make it."

She was so disgusted, she wanted to slap the purse in his meaty, earnest face. "God helps those who help themselves!" she shouted. God knew where the phrase came from. It wasn't her grandfather, who was Jewish, and it sure as shit didn't come from Rahel. A long-forgotten au pair? One of the limousine drivers?

When she stood up and stomped toward the door, his chair scraped the floor behind her. "Wait, don't..."

She slammed the door cutting his words off with a bang.

All the way back to campus, she repeated dick-turd-bastard-asshole-jerkoff- twat-cunt-fucker-fuck-off-fuck-for-brains-fuckity-shitting-shithead-dick. Why was she always the bitch! She made one uncharacteristic attempt to help somebody and he threw it back in her face, the fucking idiot.

In bed that night, she woke four or five times wondering what in the fucking hell was wrong with Lorenzo the Lunk Head.

When the breakfast bell went off the next morning, the closet door was open the way Essie liked it, though she was still locked up in Stable. The spot where the bag always sat on the shelf so Essie could see it first thing in the morning was empty. She felt a terrible pang of loss, not just for herself, but for Essie. What she really wanted to do was to find L-hole and snatch the bag back from him. He was so stupid, he'd probably settle for \$50 from the consignment store, not understanding the cat bag was worth a hundred times that.

Then the realization hit her. Oh fucking fuckity fuck fuck! Lydia's Sociology notes were in the Lieber bag. So was the homework that was due today. Now she'd have to talk track down Lorenzo and ask for her papers back.

No good deed goes unpunished. Why was it Lydia always had to learn that lesson the hard way?

Later in the day, during session, Darlene asked her what had her so worked up. She'd gotten three communication warnings on Lydia in four days. "Now you dumped all over Essie and she can't even fight back. Why are you so ugly to everybody around you?"

"I'm just mad." Her own voice sounded whiny and pathetic.

"I get that," Darlene said. "But why? What are you mad about?"

She blew out a breath and a sloppy curl flopped into one eye. She pushed it away viciously. "I need a pair of scissors."

"What for?"

"To get rid of this." She pulled the coil of springy hair out until it stretched below her nose. "It's bugging me."

Darlene moved behind her desk and handed her an ancient orange-handled scissors.

She held the hank out straight and instead of trimming off two inches as she intended, she whacked off a chunk of hair right at her hairline. It amazed her to see five inches of springy coil dangling from her fingers.

Darlene got up and dropped the scissors back in the desk drawer. "Great. Nw you've got a cowlick where you used to have a curl. How about if you tell me what's bothering you before you snatch yourself bald?"

\"I can't believe I did that."

Lydia's rational brain was shocked but then again, another part of her was drawn to the idea of cutting off every hair to the root. That would fix me.

"I tried to help somebody yesterday." She kept her voice low so it didn't crack. "He wouldn't let me."

"Go on."

"He... his name is Lorenzo," she said. "He's homeless. I met him at NICC."

Darlene waited.

In dribs and drabs, Lorenzo's refusal to take the winking cat bag came out and by time she got to how his stepfather had dumped him in Salt Lake City, the back of her eyeballs were hot and scratchy. She could hardly choke out the story over the ache in her throat. When she finally admitted that she'd given away Essie's favorite cat without even thinking about how she would feel , she began to cry in earnest.

JAMES BAGGED POTATOES AT THE Coeur D' Alene Food Pantry for his community service hours. It was a mindless task and being mindless suited him just fine. All the excitement of the fire and staying up till 3AM, then being so wound up with adrenalin after his close proximity to Rachel under the blanket, made it impossible to get to sleep. He felt like he\'d just dropped off when the alarm blasted him awake.

All morning, his eyeballs felt gravelly like the dirt encrusted Idaho spuds he shoveled automaton-like into net bags. He was using his arm to roll the lumps en masse into the lip of the bag on the sorting tabling. He was way more efficient than Reza who worked next to him using a one-potato-two-potato method They had about a ton of spuds to bag before noon when the poor people who needed them were allowed into the Pantry to fill their bags.

Thank God they\'d brought in another worker to fill out the shift or they would have been bagging potatoes till midnight.

At the 10 o'clock break, he said hey to the new guy who said his name was Lorenzo. He was giant and freckle faced and so big, he could have made it onto the NICC football team as a walk on. Hell, maybe he already had. a clown's cap of red curly hair stuck out all around his LDS baseball cap. \"What\'s LDS stand for?\" James asked, nodding at the logo above the bill.

\"Church of the Latter Day Saints,\" he said.

\"You\'re Mormon?\"

"Used to be." Lorenzo took a Coke from his backpack and sucked it down. "Old hat."

James prided himself on working fast, but this Lorenzo was a bagging machine. He'd consistently filled two bags to James' one and he barely broke a sweat.

\"Breakfast of champions," James raised his own Coke in salute. "Should have known you weren't Mormon. Isn't caffeine against the rules?\"

\"Like a lot of things,\" Lorenzo shrugged. \"I don\'t think I\'m going to hell for it. Are you?\"

"Do you have to go to hell if you're already in hell?" James said but before he could elaborate, Reza, who was perched on the spud table tossed a potato he was trying to juggle at his head.

James caught the missile easily. "Jeez, Reza, could you put some energy into bagging?"

Another of Reza\'s potatoes careened out of its wobbly arc and rolled over by Lorenzo. The big guy went under the table to retrieve it and he came up with three more runaways that had fallen under the table. Lorenzo tossed them in the air one handed and he kept all three flying effortlessly in an easy rhythm. \"You gotta start with ones that are the same size when you\'re learning,\" he told Reza.

The last spud dropped into Lorenzo's outstretched hand, then he added a fourth outsized spud to his grouping. He showed them how to counter-weight the heaviest potato against three of the same size and pretty soon, Reza was getting it and then James was trying out the trick himself himself. James had always been good with his hands but he was surprised to see that Lorenzo\'s method worked pretty well.

Mr. McGregor, who supervised all the volunteers and kept them busy, barreled in at the end of break with a load of parsnips when James, Lorenzo and Reza all had spuds flying in front of them. McGregor laughed. He shook his head good naturally, but told them to get in gear before the Food Pantry opened its doors to the clients. "Hungry people can\'t wait," he said.

After that, all three of them buckled down, even Reza, and by the noon buzzer, which was the end of their shift, they finished the mountain of potatoes and made a pretty good dent in the parsnips.

"Bet you don't know the difference between parsnips on a plate and a girl?\" Reza said at the lockers in the back room when they were putting away their aprons.

\"I\'ll bite\" Lorenzo said.

\"A girl gets eaten and parsnips don't."

James snickered. Lorenzo looked blank. \"I don\'t get it.\"

Lorenzo turned to James who had been fantasizing all morning about Rachel and the feel of her butt pressed up to him last night under the blanket, as if he expected him to explain.

"Introduce him to Lydia, and he can learn it the easy way!" Reza said.

\"Are you talking about Lydia Bronfmann?" The open and friendly gaze that Lorenzo had worn all morning was replaced by a frown. James had a memory of the angel Moroni on a ski trip to Salt Lake City. His dad drove past the Mormon Tabernacle and pointed out that Moroni was freezing his ass off.

James was about to explain that it was just a joke --- it was just Reza horsing around in his idiot-brain way----but he stopped when he saw the look of deep freeze on Lorenzo's face. It was one of the rare times in his life when James knew he was close to a precipice and had the good sense not to jump. The dufous *liked* Lydia? *Lydia* was someone worth having her honor defended? Knowing Lydia in the Biblical sense as well as knowing her behavior over the last six months didn't make James the best champion of her honor, which is why he surprised himself by snapping at Reza. \"Shut the fuck up!\" To Lorenzo, he said, "Parsnips taste OK to me. At least they're better than turnips."

There was a God. Margaret honked the horn out in the parking lot to let them know the van was here to pick them up. " Sorry, that's our ride." James shrugged, as of he\'d like to hang out longer and explain

\"See you Monday,\" Lorenzo raised a hand the size of a side of beef.

\"Sure. I'll say hey to Lydia for you."

When Reza got in the van and slammed the door shut, James said, "Jesus Reza. Use some judgment! You're goddamn lucky you didn't get pounded into a greasy spot!"

Reza, busy pulling out the potatoes he\'d stuffed in his pocket, said, \"Pretty cool juggling tips, weren\'t they?\"

James let out a groan. What would it be like to go around every day of your life like Reza, completely immune to the feelings of the people around you?

One giant step for mankind, a small step for James.

JAMES SLEPT AS IF SUBMERGED deep in dark water and he floated for a long time, rising slowly through blackness, then brackishness, then blue dimness before the world revealed itself in gray ashen light. Fuck, he groaned. He wanted to go for a run in the worst way. He\'d seen people running occasionally on the roads, completely smothered in wool hats and tights and gloves but he couldn\'t figure out how they managed to stay upright when there was a layer of black ice hidden under the deceptive blanket of snow.

He\'d finally hailed a runner who was loping past the shuttle at the NICC campus. He'd ignored Margaret\'s screech \-- \"James! You nimrod! Get back here! \-- and he called out to the bearded guy.

\"What are you putting your shoes?\"

The old grizzled dude flashed James a grin. \"Idaho cleat,\" he said. He pulled his foot up like he was stretching a quad and twisted backward to point to the screw heads that poked through his waffle woven sole. "Two inch screws work best. Carpet tacks work but they wear out too fast.\"

James lay on his back thinking about how in hell he was going to get his hands on a hammer and anything sharper than a toothpick. God forbid if the program slipped up and one of them managed to nail their foot to a coffee table.

A foul smell intruded on his thoughts. He looked across the room in the gray light for Reza, his roommate, or the little shit's shoes. He\'d told Reza to leave the foul, sweat-stained Vans out in the hall. He couldn\'t see them but that didn\'t mean Reza hadn\'t stashed them under the bed. James would deal with that. He\'d bury them in the trash bins next to the garage. Reza would piss and moan but Vans out of sight were Vans out of mind.

The longer he lay in bed, the stronger the smell got. James sat up and switched on the light. The door swung open and Reza trotted into the room in his jockey shorts, red Vans on his feet, laces flapping, heels mashed down from always walking on them like they were a pair of house slippers.

He was wearing the ear muffs he'd engineered into radio receivers against the rules for contraband. James could hear a tinny buzz emanating from Reza like he\'d was traveling with a swarm of bees. No wonder everybody thought therapists were dumber than fence posts if they couldn't figure out that Reza wasn't cold, he was perpetually rocking out to Sound Garden.

\"What\'s that thing on your pillow?\" Reza said.

James turned to look where Reza was pointing. Something dark and wet was leaking onto the sheet. James plucked the pillow he\'d just been sleeping on to his chest. \"Holy fuck!\"

Flattened by the weight of James's head, a black crow lay on the white sheet with outstretched wings. Where its belly should have been, a purple mass of slowly writhing guts were dotted with fat gray blobs burrowing in the carrion flesh.

James and Reza hit the door at the same instant. Reza, skinny and wicked fast, shouldered through the door with James on his heels.

\"Margaret! Margaret!\"

Their voices echoed through the hall like young children screaming for their mother.

\#

40\.

THERE WAS THIS OKAY-LOOKING Idaho girl in Shakespeare class who sat next to James. He'd noticed her because she was always popping her gum. Annoying but kind of sexy, in a country music kind of way. She had a thing for red, white and blue spangles and cowboy boots. Her notebook sported a glossy picture of Shania Twain in cut-offs plastered on the front and she'd written on the front in loopy gold letters, \"That Don\'t Impress Me Much.\"

Girls in Malibu decorated their notebooks with Project Runway collages and sayings like "Fierce!" and "I love oral sex." Idaho was born behind the times so maybe teen age girl's notebook styles were just another facet of its backwardness. Look at that kid in World History class who wore black Converse high tops way after when not a soul in California would be caught dead in them.

Last week, the country girl offered to let him look at her test when Professor Williams gave them a pop quiz. He\'d refused, politely, but she had passed him a note while Prof. Williams was handing back their tests. James put his hand over the A- on the top of his paper while she slid her C- See me! paper to the back of her notebook. He could feel her eyes on him as he read the teacher's handwritten note on his MacBeth paper that said it would have been an A if it wasn't late.

\"Got some new weed from Tijuana," the note said. "Want to try it?\"

Did a bear shit in the woods?

She walked him out to a mud-covered Tundra truck in the parking lot. When James asked her what the deal was with the mammoth trailer hitch on the back, she said she was a barrel rider. She turned her back to show him the spangled Indian warbonnet sewn onto her denim jacket. *Queen of the Idaho Warbonnet Rodeo Since 1911* James read. "Wow. 1911. You don\'t look that old," he said.

She snorted, not unattractively.

\"What\'s your real name?\" he asked. Prof. Williams had this weird habit of calling all the girls Miss so-and_so and today he'd called her Miss Tempter . \"Candy,\" she said. It was James's turn to snort. \"Candy Tempter? That's hilarious."

"Not Tempter! It's Tremper.\"

\"Bummer,\" he said. He was feeling like Tempter was way closer to the mark as she expertly rolled a jay between red lacquered nails in the front seat of the pick-up truck.

They were parked in the big lot right in front of the NICC Student Commons, where Margaret always picked them up and dropped them off. It was close to three. He had maybe 10 minutes of freedom and besides, they were parked way back in the last row where nobody would notice.

\"Ladies first,\" he said when she offered him the lighter. She put it between red glossy lips and sucked in.

James hadn\'t had any weed since the night of the disastrous Tequila and weed and white cross(\_\_look up current speed/drug name) in Topanga Canyon. He inhaled the familiar calming smell and leaned forward to pass the joint back.

Rap! Rap! Rap! \"James \_\_\_! (last name?) Come out here this minute!"

Oh holy shit. Margaret was standing outside the truck, glaring at him like he\'d stolen her wallet.

\"Whoops,\" he said to Candy. \"Gotta go.\"

Candy\'s eyebrows flickered up with astonishment.\"Who the hell is that? Your mother?\"

\"Um.. no. We're ... not related. She\'s\...\" He had no idea how to describe Margaret. An avenging angel? The vacuum Nazi? A go-fer and van driver and sometimes a cook?

Rap! It sounded like Margaret\'s was about to put her fist through the glass. James opened the passenger door and jumped down.

\"Thanks for the Shakespeare notes,\" he said as the smell of weed unfurled around him like a snake. Margaret had him by his elbow and she practically frog marched him across the parking lot to the van.

\"What the hell are you thinking, you idiot? You\'ve been doing so well. Now you blow it when you're just getting it together?" She turned back, in the middle of her rant and shouted back at Candy who was watching them with wide eyes. \"Stay the hell away from him! Can\'t you see he\'s recovering?\"

James felt about two inches high. He couldn\'t believe how easy it had been to pick up a joint when he\'d sworn he wouldn\'t ever touch one again. It had seemed so instinctive, almost banal in its normalcy, like being asked if you wanted a Coke or a drink of water. He hadn\'t even thought about breaking the rules---no one gave a shit about the Inner Horizons agreement that everybody signed when they got to the program. What appalled him was how easy it had been to go blindly against the rules he'd set for himself.

Margaret made him sit up front with her. Nobody else was there yet for the ride back to Healing House. According to his watch, James still had five minutes of freedom which he assumed was going to be spent having his ears blistered off. Instead Margaret surprised him by saying, \"Good thing I got here early.\"

\"Why? So you could embarrass the shit out of me?"

\"So I could save you from yourself, nimrod.\"

What the hell was a nimrod? Well, if it was some kind of Idaho idiot, she had that right.

\"Are you going to write me up?\"

\"Should I?\"

\"I didn\'t inhale,\" he said hotly.

Inexplicably, she laughed. A big har-har-har Idaho laugh, unaffected and open. He had no clue what Margaret was laughing at. It would be at least a couple decades before he heard the phrase \"I didn\'t inhale\" at a party with people of his parent\'s generation, ones who\'d been around when Bill Clinton was president. It would be uncanny how he would remember Margaret\'s laugh like it was yesterday, when he hadn\'t seen her for thirty years.

\#

41\.

"HOLY GUACAMOLE!" MARGARET SHOUTED. "You didn\'t inhale and now look at that fucking Lydia.\"

James glanced over and it turned out "fucking Lydia" was almost accurate.

Margaret hauled her big frame out of the van again which seemed to involve grunting. James watched her cross in front of the van and haul ass toward a red pickup that was parked about four spaces beyond Candy's truck. This time, Margaret didn't take the time to rap on the window.

Margaret just yanked the passenger door open and she hauled Lydia out of the car as if she weighed nothing. Lydia probably didn't weigh more than 100 pounds bare-assed naked, not that James had ever seen her completely unclothed. He had seen one boob at a time, small but juicy like lemons, and he'd witnessed up close the pink rose tattoo on her belly that pointed to the thorny stem of trouble at the crux of her legs. She was kicking and flailing like a toddler having a tantrum and Margaret was trying to cover her face with her arm to avoid Lydia\'s wild punches. She was so busy fending off Lydia, she didn\'t seem aware of the big cowpuncher dude coming around the pickup bed with murder in his eyes.

James was out of the van and running toward Margaret before thought consciously hit him. The guy was middle-aged but he had big shoulders and long legs and he looked like he\'d spent his life hoisting hay bales. From the expression on his face, he was pissed off as hell at *blow job interruptus*, thanks to Margaret.

\"Don\'t even think about it, asshole," James shouted at the cowboy. Margaret shot a surprised look at him over her shoulder but the cowpuncher didn\'t back off. He yanked Lydia by one scrawny arm and Margaret had a death grip on her other arm and was pulling on her with all her weight and crying, "Let go of her, you asshole!!!"

Lydia yowled \"You\'re hurting me!\" and by then, James was throwing himself on the cowboy\'s back, hauling him backward, away from both women. He punched the asshole a couple times in the neck, not to hurt him, more like to give him a few warning slaps with an open fist to get him away from Margaret and let loose of Lydia.

But now the cowboy was fighting mad, and he started round housing James in the head and kicking at his legs with his shitkickers. James took a ringing blow to the ear and the thought crossed his mind, how the fuck did I get here? Then Margaret roared up like an avenging angel and she started beating the cowboy about his head and shoulders with her purse.

Margaret's teeth were bared and with her long graying hair flying, she looked insane. A big fifty year old overweight woman, bitch-slapping a man twenty years her junior with a purse that was roughly the size of a suitcase. It took only about thirty seconds before Cowboy put his hands over his head and ears and started backing away from Margaret, crying, "Quit! Quit, you fucking crazy bitch!"

"Touch her again and I\'m calling the cops!\"

\"She\'s a grown woman! She can do what she wants," the cowboy said.

\"Not while I\'m on duty, she can't!"

\"Who the hell are you?\"

Lydia punched the cowboy in the bicep and cried out, \"Leave her alone. She\'s just doing her job!"

James stood shoulder to shoulder with Margaret who was leaning over panting like she'd run a marathon or maybe she was thinking about throwing up. She had a vicious scratch on her neck and a look that said the job didn't pay her nearly enough for this.

"Just get in the van!" Margaret pointed to the company van. It was the new van with the Inner Horizons logo and a tagline James had never noticed. \"Let us transport you to happiness with yourself.\"

The cowboy took in the van and turned on Lydia, "You didn't tell me you were one of those nut cases!"

"I may be nuts but you just got the shit beat out of you by a 50 year old woman!" snapped Lydia. "And I'm not nuts. I'm in treatment.\"

\"Treatment for what?\"

\"Gonorrhea,\" Margaret said.

Lydia shrugged at the cowboy, like \"what can I say?\" and when Margaret pointed at her and said "You!" she clambered into the van and scuttled all the way to the very back, as far away as it was possible to get.

\"Jesus H Christ,\" Margaret said when she was starting up the engine. She breathed like she\'d just gone 10 rounds in a prizefight. \"I\'m out of shape.\"

AT VICTORY LANES, THE SCOREBOARD read:

Rachel: 42

James: 185.

The crash of pins like constant thunder. The irritating buzz of the reset button. Ball after ball thundered out of Rachel's hands onto buttery smooth wood and galloped into the gutter with an embarrassing bang and whoosh.

James said, \"You almost had it. Next time, try not to release the ball at the end of your arc.\"

Rachel, who was bad at snowboarding, terrible at board games, a danger to herself and others with a pool cue, continued her athletic shame at Thursday night bowling league.

\"I thought we are supposed to be here for R&R," she said. \"This is torture.\"

James had just stepped up to the bowling lane as gracefully as a ballet dancer. He pirouetted on a burgundy and gray shoe that should have made him look like a dweeb but instead made him look so gorgeous and unattainable she wanted to cry.

\"You\'re trying too hard,\" he said after the scoreboard lit up with another strike. James: 195 up in red and yellow lights. \"Loosen up." Then as if he intuited she couldn't take any more shame, he said, "Want a Coke? I\'m thirsty.\"

They gave up their lane to Reza and Lydia who were surprisingly competitive. Lydia looked like a '50s chick with her curly hair pulled away from her face by a wide red headband. She wore a vintage black bowling shirt that said Detroit Diesel on the back and \"Andy\" in red embroidery over her boob.

\"Nice outfit,\" Rachel said.

Reza, wearing one of James UC-San Diego tee shirts and blue jeans, said, \"Thanks,\" and then arced a marbleized ball down the lane for a strike.

\"Go fuck yourself,\" James said to Reza. "What?" he said when Rachel chastised him with her eyes. "He took my tee shirt out of my drawer without asking!"

In the Burger Shoppe, James spent his entire allowance on a cheeseburger, an orange Nehi and fries and still got fifty cents in change. Idaho.

Rachel shook her head at the blue-haired grandma who was apparently both waitress and cook. \"I already ate.\"

\"So did I,\" James said. \"That was two hours ago.\"

She laughed. \"I\'m a girl. Not a bottomless pit.\"

While they waited for the food in a booth next to the pin-ball machine, James took all the sugar packets out and stacked them up. He balanced a glass salt shaker on top of the packets, then added the pepper shaker to the pile and the whole thing toppled over. Pepper sprayed the table and Rachel sneezed.

\"Sorry,\" he said. \"I wasn\'t trying to kill you.\"

\"Finally something you\'re not good at!"

"Au contraire. Stacking sugar packets is an art. It takes hours of practice.\"

\"Have you been practicing your bowling?\"

\"No.\"

\"I didn\'t think so. And snowboarding? You were good at that too. You said it was your first time.\"

\"There\'s not a lot of snow in Malibu." James fixed her with his smoke-gray eyes. "So, it was your first time, too. You should cut yourself some slack.\"

\"You were even good at salsa. Doesn\'t it get old being great at everything?\"

James set to restacking the sugar packets in alternating horizontal and vertical directions."You just don\'t know me. Everybody knows I\'m a fuck up.\"

They'd been exchanging smart-ass quips all night and Rachel was sick of it. She folded her hands on the formica table top and waited. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"I want to know.\"

He looked around for the waitress. \"This isn\'t exactly fast food.\"

\"Why do you always do that?\"

\"What?\"

\"Change the subject.\"

\"I didn\'t. I just...\" He stopped, nonplussed.

\"What makes you a fuck-up? That\'s not what I see.\"

\"Well, you are locked up in a psychiatric treatment facility so you\'re not exactly unbiased.\"

She shrugged. \"I like you."

\"Want a bite?\" James caught Rachel eying his French fires with a look of longing. \"Why didn\'t you order something if you\'re hungry?\"

\"It\'s not that easy to admit it when you want something," she said. "Especially if it's always going to be taken away."

Wasn\'t that the truth? James wanted so much, especially in the middle of the night, to stop waking up with his heart pounding and wanting to scream. He didn't want to ever again see blood much less smell its wet penny reek.

He cut his burger in half and slid it over onto the french fry plate. Then he swallowed his half in about three bites while she was still elegantly cutting hers into bite-size bits that she speared with a fork. She ate her fries with a fork, too, one at a time. Her manners were so controlled, so elegant, in contrast to her graceless lunges and ball drops on the bowling lanes. Same story on the ski slope where she careened and fell and slid down the hillon her butt, one foot dragging the snowboard like an anchor. She was tall and gangly, built like him, he realized, but she seemed not quite in command of her limbs. He remembered feeling the same way when he was 13, the year he shot up 5\" and felt like his body had taken off without him.

\"What are you looking at?\" she asked.

\"You,\" he said. It was true. It was hard to not look at her and want to hold her hand.

> \"So tell me why you\'re a fuck up.\"

The terror and helplessness of holding her kicking and jerking legs was in his thoughts. How he wanted to help her and stop her involuntary and embarrassing loss of control. How he willed her to come back to consciousness with her eyes righted in her skull and her feet no longer drumming on the floor, despite James\' efforts to hold them still.

\"I killed a girl,\" he said softly.

\"How?\"

\"I was driving. We were drunk and stoned. I went off the road in Topanga Canyon by my house and we rolled.\"

\"Is that how you hurt your shoulder?\"

He nodded, feeling the ghost of the ache that was like a reminder that he couldn\'t ignore.

\"She died in the crash?\"

Why did it feel like he was flaying himself alive? His nerves felt raw and exposed, yet he sat forward and kept talking. She\'d exposed herself to him in all her ugliness and at her most vulnerable. It only seemed fair.

\"I woke up and got out of the car and left her to walk home. She bled to death.\"

\"Did you know she was hurt?\"

\"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"There was blood all over.\" Who would have thought so much blood in her? Macbeth and the shame those words inspired in him the first time he read them came back to him like a wave of nausea.

\"Was she close to you?\"

\"Right next to me in the passenger seat of the Corvette that flew apart like a cardboard car in the crash.\"

Rachel shook her head. "I mean, did you know her well?"

James shook his head. \"She asked me for a ride home. I didn\'t even know her name until after." After, meaning when the cop who interviewed him told him he was being charged with manslaughter and reckless driving and said her name was Charlotte Shantz and he misheard him and thought it was just his luck to kill a girl named Chance.

He realized belatedly that Rachel had reached across the table. She was gripping one of his hands with both of her hands, covering the top and the bottom of his fingers like a protective shell. \"I know,\" she said. \"I know.\"

Her low voice. The warmth of her fingers. The smell of French fry grease and the fog of bar smoke and the intermittent buzz of the reset button. What an odd place to get forgiveness but James would take it.

"It hurts,\" he said.

\"I know,\" she said.

It had been months and months of therapy sessions and Group Gropes and calls with one or the other of his bewildered and frightened parents and he\'d never been able to talk about that night until he told Rachel about the blood he\'d wiped on the cheat grass to get it off his hands. The way the girl -- a year later he was unable to refer to her by name which he knew was Charlotte \-- had been breathing high and wheezy in her chest. He\'d woken in blinding pain and tried to rouse her but she\'d been so far under, all she could do was groan. He\'d had terrible vertigo and it seemed like it took forever to clamber up the rock strewn slope that the Corvette had tumbled down end over end. Big chunks of fiberglass covered with brown paper backing dotted the hillside. A door panel. A chunk of hood. A trunk section still attached to a chrome fender caught in a clump of knapweed. It looked like the car had exploded and what he mistakenly had thought was steel and metal turned out to be nothing but flimsy paper.

When he looked back at the girl from far above her, he could see her still strapped in her seat by the seatbelt and there was almost no car around her. Just chassis and tires and a dashboard. She must have hit her head. Blood was everywhere.

He told Rachel about how he didn't remember getting home, that some good Samaritan gave him a ride and dropped him at the security gate of his parent\'s house. He couldn\'t remember the code to key it in and instead, leaned on the buzzer and told Lupe the maid to come. His mother drove her car down the long drive in her night gown and she took one look at his injuries, and drove him straight to the emergency room. He remembered her standing in a blue lamb-printed nightie talking to the ER doc while he lay on a gurney. After that it was all a blur.

Months later, he learned from reading the newspaper that the girl was probably breathing her last breaths, while the wind riffled her henna-red hair, as he half crawled, half stumbled up the hill and walked two miles until a good Samaritan gave him a ride. She died alone while he was being ferried to the hospital by his neurosurgeon and he never mentioned one word about her.

He was staring at Rachel's catsup on the plate and seeing a featureless face bathed in red. Jesus. How Rachel could even look at him in his naked ugliness, he didn\'t understand.

"I know," she squeezed his hand during his recitation, her warm fingers reassuring him and keeping him talking till all the shame was out on the table. "I know."

Rachel revealed her own self at its ugliest in her epileptic fit--- when some alien spirit commandeered her body and transformed it into a being nobody recognized----and he recognized a kindred spirit. His body \-- the one he was so used to depending on for his balletic speed with the ball, his three-point sinkers from the corner or the inside \-- his own body had betrayed him at the crucial moment. It had taken him up the mesquite-strew slope, limping, his forearm pinched tight against his ribs as he walked and when he got home to his neurosurgeon mother who might have been able to do something, he never even mentioned the girl he should have saved.

LYDIA THOUGHT THE COWBOY'S name was Ned not Jed.

She had been meeting up with him in the NICC parking lot for a month. She\'d walked by him in his pickup one day at Dunkin' Donuts and he'd given her a ride back to campus. He'd squawked a little about how much she wantsd till she demonstrated a loss leader. She didn\'t know squat about him. There wasn\'t a lot of talking when someone was pressing his cowboy hat over her head to cover up what was going on in his lap.

It really surprised her when Margaret called him Jed. Jed? Like the guy on those stupid Beverly Hills Hillbillies reruns the maids in Grosse Point liked to watch?

Lydia didn't mind giving blowjobs. She wasn\'t squeamish about the smells or the taste. The sense of power she had with someone\'s dick in her mouth was worth almost as much as the money. \$100 for ten minutes seemed like an OK trade when it meant she could buy a Sephora makeup palette or a pair of Lulu Lemon pants, plus feel someone shiver and tremble under her tongue.

Her therapist Rosa was always asking her what all the sex was about. \"What do you get out of it?\" was what Rosa said when Lydia got caught. \"I get money,\" which is what Jed handed over when she met him between classes for a quickie. If she was honest with herself, it wasn\'t about just the money. Sure! She had something men\-- and once, a woman---wanted. A straight forward business transaction. I do this. You give me that.

She had done it with him standing up in an alley, she did it in the boys bathroom once when some other guy was peeing in the urinal, she did it in Jed\'s pickup, under cover of the table at Dunkin' Donuts, all because she liked how powerful she felt. Getting paid was a bonus when you could tap into someone\'s electrical outlet with a flick of a tongue. Men trembled. Men shook! They quivered and got goose bumps and groaned when she blew their brains out of the tiny slit at the tip of their joy sticks. That was the juice she couldn\'t get enough of.

She never felt more in control than when she was either promising sex or delivering it. The problem was the minute it was over the juice turned off. She felt out of control and bereft.

Lydia scooted to the far back of the van, as far away from Margaret as she could get after the altercation. She expected to be yelled at or guilt-tripped or flogged by her tongue or something. So when the silence stretched out the length of the ride back to Healing House, she wondered when the lecture was going to start. The back window was iced over inside. It was like sitting in a freezer after being in a sauna.

Margaret drove, chewing a piece of gum like she was trying to bite it into little pieces.

Jed had flipped Lydia off when Margaret towed her away from him. He seemed to have some weird idea that she should have defended him from Margaret and her lethal purse.

\"Hey Margaret,\" Lydia called out, moving out of frigid Barfland finally in order to get closer to the heater. \"Who called the doctor? Who called the Nurse? Who called the lady with the alligator purse?\"

\"What is *in* that thing?\" James asked. \"Rocks?\"

Margaret scrabbled around in the gap between the seats, driving one handed. First, she hauled out a lunch box with a Dilbert cartoon on the front from its black depths. Flipping open the latch, she said, \"Want some carrots?\" She offered them first to James and told him to pass them to Lydia. Then Margaret continued hunting deep in the purse's innards and after a minute, she made a cry of delight. \"There you are!\"

She held up a crescent wrench the size of a man\'s forearm. It must have weighed ten pounds and in Margaret's upraised arm, it look like a symbol of the Communist revolution.

"Damn! You could have killed somebody with that thing!" James said.

\"Why do you have a wrench in your purse?" asked Lydia.

Margaret acted like it was perfectly normal. \"There\'s a leak in the girl\'s bathroom. I have to to change the gasket.\"

\"Why don\'t you call the plumber?\" said Lydia.

\"It\'s just a gasket. Anybody can change one.\"

\"I can\'t,\" Lydia said.

\"You don\'t know enough to change a gasket or an o-ring? That\'s criminal. I\'ll show you after you tell your therapist what you were doing in Jed\'s pickup.\"

"Before or after I tell her you nearly killed him,\" Lydia said.

\"You wouldn\'t.\"

\"I would.\"

\"I definitely would," said James. "You\'re insane!"

\"The little shit deserved it!He was using Lydia. "Margaret shot a dark look at Lydia. "Did you know he's old enough to be your dad?"

Ewwwww. Lydia had had no idea.

"That\'s sick," said James.

\"So is hitting him on the skull with a crescent wrench,\" Lydia snapped. "Besides, what difference does it make how old he is? He likes me.\"

\"I can see he likes you. That\'s why he was making you give him head in broad daylight. Very romantic. Just because a guy wants something, you don\'t have to say yes.

It was impossible for Lydia to explain how she was the one using whoever she had sex with. Already, not half an hour after Margaret had hauled her out of Jed's pickup, she was feeling the emptiness, the power hungry itch that only one thing would scratch. It wasn\'t that she liked him --- she really had thought his name was Ned\-- but she loved the way she could control him. Shake. Quiver. Flood. It wasn\'t about her orgasm, not that she didn\'t like them. It was about making him completely helpless and under her index finger and her thumb.

Margaret waggled a finger at both of them \"You two. What am I going to do with you?\"

\"Nothing?\" James said in the manner of innocent choirboy.

\"Don\'t ask, don\'t tell,\" Lydia said. "Our lips are sealed.\"

\"Your lips better be sealed, missy." She shot a warning look at Lydia. "If I see you with Jed Simplot again\-\--,\" she gave her purse a shake and the sound of metal clanked like a dumb bell.

\"Against my better judgment,\" Margaret said.

\"Forget the judgment,\" James advised.\" Go for your own self-interest.\"

Margaret didn\'t just demonstrate how to change the gasket. She made Lydia pull the faucet and clean out the gunk in the trap and replace the washers and the rings. James went through the same routine at another sink.

It felt good to do something with her hands.

\"You\'re a wiry little thing. Stronger than I thought," Margaret told her. "Plus you're a quick study.\"

Lydia was surprised by the compliment. When the water gushed out of the pipe and shut off clean without a single drip, she felt a small surge of pride.

\"When we graduate from the program, maybe we can become plumbers,\" James said.

\"It pays better than Day Supervisor,\" Margaret said.

Does it pay better than sucking dick? Lydia wanted to know but had the sense not to ask.

Margaret packed up her tools and reminded James to meet Josh at his downtown office at 3:30. She told Lydia to be on time for her 3:00 with Rosa, her therapist.

\"Tell her what you learned today,\" Margaret said.

\"About changing gaskets or giving blow jobs?\"

"The one you learned more from,\" Margaret said.

LYDIA AND CHARLENE WERE ARGUING in the entry about why Lydia had to interview for her community service hours. \"I shouldn\'t have to work! My family already pays through the nose to keep me here.\"

\"You\'re not working for money,\" Charlene said. \"It\'s about learning responsibility.\"

"Horse shit,\" Lydia said. \"If you\'re not getting paid, why work?\"

Margaret had to agree with the spoiled little rich girl. Work was about the money, especially money that paid for healthcare.

\"Put your gloves on,\" she said automatically to Lydia. \"It\'s cold out.\"

Lydia made a snotty face at Charlene but drew a fur lined coat out of the closet and shrugged into it. She saw Margaret eyeing it and said \"It\'s mink. Want to feel?\"

Margaret touched a hand to the dark silken fur, then leaned past her and plucked her old down coat on a hanger. Fur, she thought, who needed fur when you could have a low deductible?

Omar bumped into Reza on purpose. He hit the closet door and the cheap handle fell off. Margaret sighed and picked it up, adding another task to a to-do list as long as her arm.

Omar called shot gun and bolted towards the van, but James beat him to it. There was nearly a fist fight until Margaret hollered, \"Would you three grow up!\" She fixed them with a glower. \"I\'m not in the mood.\"

Against company rules, Margaret turned up the CD player and let the sound system shake the car with the power of its bass. Macklemore to the rescue. She bet he could afford health care.

LYDIA FINALLY PASSED THE 15-month month mark at Inner Horizons.

Theoretically you spent the first 3 months in Intensive which was like being on lock down twenty-four hours a day. They treated you like you were on an ankle wire and kept you trapped in an endless cycle of individual therapy, group therapy, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Mindfulness Meditation, and Reflection Time when you were supposed to be thinking about your self without the diversion of other people, TV, video games, or even music.

Frankly, the Reflection Time was more than she could bear, which was why she tried to escape the 1^st^ time. Her reflections had led her to walk out the back door when Gretchen had her head in the oven (if there was a God, he'd light the gas stove and blow her to the high heaves). She rode shotgun on the Smith Brothers milk truck with the driver blissfully unaware she was freezing her ass off on his bumper. During his frequent delivery stops, she crouched down behind trees and bushes, and once, a mailbox in the shape of a cow, to avoid being spotted. Then she ran like hell and clambered back on the bumper when he took off.

She made it as far as E. Coeur d'Alene but she had the bad luck to be tailed by a state trooper who gave the Smith Brothers guy a ticket and drove her back to the program. They'd already issued an APB. It all added up to a month at Stabilization, and another three months in Intensive.

At the six months mark, they had finally loosened the leash and let her sign up at North Idaho Community College for classes. If you proved you could go to class without running and then show up to class on time and do the asinine homework assignments, the next \"privilege\" you earned was community service at your choice of "approved" non-profits.

She wasn't that motivated to get an interview until she met Lorenzo. Given a choice between bagging groceries at the Pend O\'reille Food Bank or cleaning toilets at the Povarello homeless center, she was amused to find herself sitting in the threadbare lobby of the Povarello Center awaiting the Head of Housekeeping. She hadn\'t seen Lorenzo for almost a week. He was a no-show at the Student Union. No show in Business Math, which was only tolerable because she sat behind him and could spy on his careful, square-lettered notes.

She hoped Caritas Ziemkowski, Head of Housekeeping, wasn\'t a female. She could wrap any man around her finger but it wasn\'t so easy, when they were women as street smart as Margaret. Pray for something with a dick, she was thinking, as she inspected the grisly cross with a dead body hanging under the Povarello sign in the lobby. \"In service to others.\" If this was what religion expected of you, forget it.

Oh holy crap.

She rose, uncertain whether to shake hands or kneel down to an ancient and creaky looking priest. Be careful what you wish for. He was the real meal deal: clad in a white collar and a black, long cassock belted with rope. A bunch of beads below his waist looked like he was hung with carved nutmegs. \"Brother Ziemkowski, my dear,\" said the priest---or was he a monk?\--extending a liver-spotted, bird-claw hand.

Lydia 's religious training was an inch thick and a thousand miles wide. She barely knew how to address a rabbi, much less a priest, so she settled for \"Hi there. I'm Lydia Bronfmann. From Inner Horizons.\"

\"You\'re Lydia? From Inner Horizons? You're here about the receptionist job?\"

\"No fa-- brother,\" she amended. \" I\'m here about the cleaning position.\"

\"On your knees\" he said. \" At least that\'s how it's typically done.\"

It took her a heartbeat to realize the little white haired elfin sprite was joking. He had no wrinkles -- none. Yet he could have been eighty, hell, ninety, even. He looked eye-to-eye with Lydia, who was five feet in her stockings.

\"You don\'t look much bigger than the mop,\" the odd little monk said.

Look who's talking she wanted to say.

"You\'d be surprised what I can do if I put my mind to it.\"

"Good," he said. "A mind of your own."

He asked a few general questions about her -- was she going to school? Affirmative. What was she taking? Business Math and English. Delightful!

Then Brother Boniface gave her the grand tour of the aging and hard worn facility. It looked to her like a pitched battle had been fought here daily. Scuffed walls. Linoleum so old, it was lifting away from the wall and cracked in places. Ancient plumbing wheezed and clanked like a million dwarves were at work in the basement as they walked the dim wax-smelling halls.

Finally, he led her up a half flight of stairs to a janitorial closet and said, \"The second floor hall could use a scrub. Mind if we test you out today?\"

Lydia knew what a mop was, of course. She'd seen the phalanx of house cleaners and maids and gardeners and cooks at work at their duties in the 26-room art deco mansion she'd lived in off-and-on with her grandmother and grandfather in Grosse Point. Dutifully, she took the mop by the business end, eyeing the grey ropy clump that looked like a Medusa\'s head of snakes.

"Call me Brother B -- not father!" he said. "I\'m a Dominican friar. Very different from a priest! And Brother B. Is simpler." He didn't say simpler for whom, just sent her to an ancient sink with deep rust stains to fill a bucket with water and detergent.

\"Have at it, my dear,\" Brother B beamed. \"I\'ll be back to check on you in an hour.\"

She left a trail of soapy water behind her as she lugged the heavy pail down a long hallway flanked by narrow cells. Most of the doors were open. Narrow steel beds. Gray-striped mattress ticking. One flattened pillow the thickness of a comic book to a room.

It took her a while to figure out that she had to keep wringing out the mop or she was just pushing the dirt around.

She wondered where Lorenzo lived. Did he have an assigned room or did he have to move in and out on some institutional schedule? She\'d never thought about being homeless. If dirty street people stretched their hands out, she looked away and kept her head down on her way into Saks or Nieman Marcus. \"Spare some change,\" she had heard them call but she never bothered to spare a look.

She flung the droopy mop back and forth on the wood and wondered why Brother Boniface hadn't asked much about her. When he wanted to know where she hailed from, Grosse Point seemed to stump him, but when she said Detroit, that seemed to snag his attention. \"Home of Motown!\" he beamed, which seemed pretty funny coming from a guy dressed in a brown sack tied with a rope.

He did ask her why she wanted to work at the Povarello Center instead of the Couer D'Alene Food Bank. The Povarello Center was two miles away from NICC. A long walk in the cold. The real reason was because she wanted to be where Lorenzo was and where James, who was doing his community service at the food bank, wasn't. Luckily she remembered the prayer she'd read in the lobby and paraphrased the phrase that got stuck in her head. \" Better to console than be consoled\" came out as \" Better to mop than be mopped,\" she said and to her surprise,Brother B. clapped his boney hands and laughed. He sounded like the clatter of dry leaves but his delight had been surprisingly sweet.

She was sweating up a storm by the time she worked her way almost the whole way down the hall, doggedly throwing the mop out in front of her wringing it with both hands. She had no idea how much time had gone by when she heard the gentle slap of sandals and Brother B called out to her. \"Look at you! You're making the old place sparkle.\"

It would have taken a load of dynamite to break the layers of grime off, much less make it gleam. Still, Brother B\'s praise made her inordinately proud of her progress.

He lugged the dirty water back to the sink for her, even though she tried to wrestle the bucket from him. The old bird was surprisingly wiry and tenacious. She was about to ask him if he knew Lorenzo, when the he said, \"Come. You can help me with an errand of mercy.\"

He took her down the backstairs to an industrial size kitchen. \"One of our clients is sick with the flu," he told her as he boiled water for tea and cut up cheese and bread and sliced several apples. He stopped, as if concerned. \"You won\'t catch it will you?\"

\"I never get sick."

Brother B looked like he\'d blow over in a strong breeze so she said, "Maybe you should let me deliver the food." She was thinking about old people having poor autoimmune systems. Lydia\'s grandmother, and the other old biddies in her Bridge group, were always wearing masks because one of the ladies was always getting sick.

\"Oh no dear,\" he said. \" We have to go up to the men-only floor. I\'ll have to be your escort.\"

Lydia carried the tray, the tea pot clinking as she climbed the stairs. Her legs felt like jelly by the time they climbed four flights while Floor Brother B. Barely had a hitch in his breath.

Halfway down the silent hall, he rapped his knuckles on a closed door. A raspy voice said something indistinguishable that Brother B. seemed to take as assent. He swung the door open and Lydia was amazed to see Lorenzo pale and sweating in the bed covers.

\"Come in, dear. Put the tray on the desk,\" motioned Brother B.

Lorenzo looked like shit. He hadn\'t shaved. A soft rusty fuzz covered his lower face and his red curls sproinged out every direction. He was staring at her like she'd grown another head. \"Lydia!\" he croaked. \"You\'re not supposed to be up here.\"

She glanced at Brother B. who was busy whipping a thermometer out of its wrapper. \"You two know each other?\" he asked.

A mass of brown freckles covered Lorenzo's chest and shoulders and his skin was so pasty white his freckles stood out like peppercorns on the large expanse of skin. Lydia felt suddenly shy without knowing why.

\"Lydia\'s our new janitorial assistant,\" Brother B told Lorenzo. \"Did you know she\'s a maestro with a mop?"

This was patently ridiculous but apparently Lorenzo was used to Brother B\'s humor. He said, \"Takes a mop master to know a mop maestro.\"

Lydia poured out tea in a chipped white mug and she automatically put in three packets of sugar with the milk. \"What\'s wrong with you? I was getting worried."

\"It\'s just the flu. A mean one," Lorenzo said.

\"I haven\'t seen you since last Friday,\" she said.

"You were worried? About me?\" Her admission seemed to flummox him. He had to speak around the thermometer Brother B. had stuck in his mouth like a lollipop.

Brother B peered at the mercury and then held it out to Lydia, saying, \"Can you read this? I misplaced my glasses.\" Lydia found the mark on the mercury without difficulty but frowned at what she saw. \"One hundred and three. Is that right?\"

Instinctively, she put her hand on Lorenzo\'s large forehead and felt heat radiating off him in waves. A memory of being very sick with a sore throat transported her to her old bedroom in New York when her mom and dad were still married. She felt a big cool hand on her head. Worried eyes in a dim and faraway face. Dad? Did he take care of me when I was sick? There was nothing else to the memory. Just a hand and a sense of concern. \"You\'re burning up," she said.

Brother B said, \"It\'s time to call Dr. George, Lorenzo. Your fever is too high."

"I'm fine, Brother. Just give me a day to recover.\"

\"It might be strep throat." Brother B was busy feeling under Lorenzo\'s jaw below his ears. \"Your lymph nodes are swollen.\"

\"I can\'t pay, Brother B. Don\'t call him.\"

"The Center will take care of Dr. George. You know he doesn\'t charge us like his regular patients.\"

Lydia watched Lorenzo take a sip of tea and grimace when the hot tea slid over his infected throat. A flash of pain darkened his eyes.

\"My mom will pay for the doctor. She can afford it," Lydia said. She didn\'t know how to tell Lorenzo or Brother B. that the Bronfman whiskey fortune could buy any number of hospitals plus the pharmaceutical companies that supplied them.

\"Absolutely not!\" The strain on Lorenzo's larynx sent him into a paroxysm of coughing.

\"My name is Lydia Heinz Bronfmann. You know how you were eating French fries the other day and pounding the Heinz bottle and swearing at it? That\'s the Heinz I\'m talking about. We also own Seagrams.\"

"You\'re hired,\" said Brother B. \"We need a new roof.\"

Lorenzo closed his eyes tightly and she realized he was trying to keep tears from squeezing out. \"I pay my own way," he said.

\"And how are you going to do that flat on your back, you big lug?\"

Lydia\'s mom, the serial marrier was always saying that men were idiots. If Brother B. was maybe the exception, Lorenzo was proving the rule.

\"Do you even have a job?\" she asked.

Lorenzo\'s eyes swept off to the window. \"Probably not now," he muttered.

\"So I\'ve got money and you don\'t. Who cares.\"

\"I\'m not your responsibility.\"

\"A family is supposed to be responsible for you. Yours is a piece of shit.\" For maybe the 1^st^ time in Lydia\'s life, it occurred to her that by Lorenzo\'s shitty yardstick, her own family wasn't that bad. So her mom got married a lot but Grandma and Grandpa Bronfman were in her corner. If she needed something, it was always there. Nobody would throw her out on her own to fend for herself, even with all the shit she pulled.

Lorenzo\'s voice was slow and stubborn. \"You\'re not my family.\"

\"I\'m a friend, and that trumps a fucked up family any day." She was imagining the scene at the bus stop when Lorenzo\'s stepfather handed him \$100 and turned his back on him at the bus stop without a backward glance. It made her mad just thinking about it. There was a first for everything. Didn\'t the Bronfmann Corporation employ a whole floor of corporate lawyers at its headquarters in Detroit? Wouldn\'t at least one of them have time to investigate a polygamist in Hilldale, Utah? Grandpa Ben wasn\'t big on hugs and compliments but he was hella-good at suing people. That's what Mom always said.

It took about ten minutes of Brother B and Lydia's tag-team to railroad Lorenzo into a visit from Dr. George. Then Brother B walked Lydia down the stairs to the front door. \"Will M-W-F, 2-6, work with your classes?\" he said, beaming. \"Good interview. One of my best!"

"Looking forward to it, Brother."

Lydia kicked her way through 3 or 4 inches of snow that had fallen while she was in the Povarello Center. The sound of car traffic was hushed, pillowed by the softly falling snowflakes. The street lamps lit golden arcs in the dimness and Lydia walked through golden light feeling the slightly pleasurable ache of hard work between her shoulders. \"Good things come to those who wait.\" It was an ad slogan from the family business in the '80s. She\'d seen it once on an office wall when she went to visit Grandpa Ira. It was a good one. Maybe she should tell him they should bring it back.

ON HER WAY INTO COSTCO, Magaret eyed the carts people had abandoned in the parking lot. It took maybe an extra minute to roll your cart to the return zone but people were so lazy or just didn\'t give a damn and nobody did it. Everybody do your part and the parking lot will be clear. That was Margaret\'s motto but apparently she was the only one who practiced what she preached.

A woman next to her was unloading cases of Coke, a hundred pound bag bag of dog food and an enormous stuffed kangaroo with its little paws up like it was ready to clock someone. Margaret had always wondered who bought those things. Her answer was a stylish grandma in leopard printed spandex and a pair of knee high fur boots.

Margaret was about to offer to take her cart back, when she decided to wait and see whether the woman would restore her faith in humanity.

Nope. The woman shoved the cart to the front of her saintly Prius and drove off, avoiding the lethal stare Margaret laid on her as she passed. If she could have, she would have issued her a Spandex violation!

It took nearly an hour of treading down every Costco aisle like a rat looking for the cheese for Margaret to finish her list. Margaret surveyed the checkout lanes for one that was less than 10 deep. She chose one that had only 5 people but every single one of them had industrial flatbed carts like they were shopping for the flood.

Of course her cart wasn\'t much better. She was shopping for 30 after all. A case of Maalox? Margaret perused the shopping list and wondered who the case of Maalox was for. She\'d have to ask Gretchen when she got back. It wasn\'t Hazey. That man never worried a whit even when all hell was breaking loose.

The next item, though, was definitely Hazey\'s. A case of laxatives. The man\'s drug use had his whole system so stopped up he often disappeared in the bathroom for hours. Gretchen had descended to lurking outside the john to get the good doctor to sign off on purchase orders for groceries and office supplies. Margaret didn\'t lurk. She just shoved papers under the door and she picked them up from the bathroom counter later. She'd read about managing upward. How about managing when he was sitting down.

A familiar voice called out to her. \"Margie? Margie Centerguard, is that you?\"

Centerguard was Margaret's maiden name. She hadn\'t used it since high school. \"Oh my word. Betsy Vance!\"

Betsy looked a hell of a lot better preserved than Margaret did. She stood in front of Margaret in the line with a small cart of groceries. Her hair was streaked with a professional mix of blond and brown and ash and she was wearing a professional pant suit with a silk blouse and high heels. Margaret was wearing her usual blouson top to cover her wide-load hips, stretch slacks (same reason) and Nikes to be nice to her falling arches. Gravity. Not her friend.

Betsy had been one of her pals in high school, before Hank and hormones took over. They'd lost touch when Margaret got pregnant and Betsy, who'd been a straight A student, went off to Gonzaga for college. Margaret heard though the grape-vine she\'d gotten a degree in accounting.

\"What are you up to? It\'s been a coon's age.\"

\"I just had my coon's wrinkles worked on," Betsy said. \"How do you like my face lift?\"

"You? A face lift? If I won the lottery, I'd go for a butt lift!" Margaret said. "Hell, I'd have it removed!"

Betsy, who had always been a sweet person, tsk-tsked. "You look fine, Margie. Besides, you got two kids out of the deal. All I've got is my eyelids stapled to the top of my head."

Both women laughed. Margaret remembered that Betsy had gotten divorced after marrying her college boy friend. It wasn't like eligible men---hell, men with health care---were thick on the ground in Coeur D'Alene. Small town living had its advantages but marriage after divorce wasn't one of them.

Betsy\'s face looked different for sure. Good different. Fresh and rested, while Margaret's always looked like she'd been run over by a Mack Truck. Margaret said truthfully, \"You look spectacular.\"

\"Oh honey, you were always the nicest girl in high school.\" Betsy hugged her and Margaret got a whiff of hairspray and a light perfume. \"What are you doing with yourself?\" Betsy was eyeing the case of laxative on top of Margaret\'s overloaded cart.

\"I\'m housekeeping for Inner Horizons. It's the rehab place for troubled kids North of town."

\"That makes sense. You were always trying to rescue people.\"

I was? Margaret could hardly imagine her high school self before husband and kids and aging parents and Hank's back problems. It was like imagining the dinosaur age. Come and gone.

"I just met your boss--Dr. Hazey?--he came into the bank the other day.\"

It turned out that Betsy, who was the branch manager at Wells Fargo had just approved a loan for Dr. Hazey. Very interesting.

Sounds like business is great,\" Betsy said.

\"Nuts R Us,\" Margaret said. \"You never run out of crazy kids.\"

\"Doctor Hazey seems like a ball of energy,\" Betsy said.

So Betsy had met him on a load of uppers. When she went in to his office to get the Costco purchase order signed, his eye lids drooped and he seemed practically catatonic. So old Hazey was in getting a new loan. What for? She was thinking.

Betsy was taking back her Costco card. She squeezed Margaret\'s hand kindly before she left, saying, \"Let\'s have coffee and catch up.\" She handed her a business card and Margaret read Betsy Vance, Branch Manager, with a silent whistle. \"You bet,\" Margaret said. \"I\'d love that.\"

\"Good luck on the expansion,\" Betsy said.

What expansion? Hazey had gotten a loan to *expand* the business? They were packed to the gills and Gretchen had said a new kid was expected at the end of the week. Margaret wasn\'t sure where they going to put her. In the rafters?

Well, that was good news. If Hazey expanded Inner Horizons with a new facility, he\'d have to increase her hours, wouldn\'t he? He\'d need somebody to run the new house or maybe he\'d move Gretchen to the new place (hallelujah!) and give her Healing House to Margaret to manage?

By the time Margaret loaded up the van and was returning her grocery cart to the cart corral, she had her new job--and commensurate benefits and salary all figured out. The man next to her in a Subaru finished unloading his car about the same time she did.

She decided to try out her new managerial skills on him. \"I sure hate people who don\'t return their carts, don\'t you?\"

He had already moved the cart to the front of his car so he wouldn\'t back into it.

She smiled beatificallly at him\--really beamed with all her considerable wattage\-- and he succumbed to the power of positive suggestion.

\"You\'re a good cart citizen,\" she said. And waved to him to back out before her as his reward.

You just needed to give people a little push to get them moving in the right direction, she thought.

Maybe she\'d send her idea for parking lot signs to the President of Costco. \"Be a good cart citizen.\" It had a nice ring to it.

Now all she had to do was figure out how to shove Hazey in the right direction.

RUSTY HOWLED AT THE TOP of his lungs and slammed his fist on the wheel on the night the tall kid wrapped up *his* blond girl in a blanket. He\'d driven like a bat out of hell back to the trailer at the Dump so he could get his rifle but by the time he got back to crazy house, all the kids were already back inside. The asshole with the blanket wasn't anywhere. It wasn't like he really had a plan. He'd been too furious to think. All he could see was the top of the asshole\'s head flying apart like a melon when a hollow point hit him between the eyes.

After a coupla days, he calmed down some and came up with a better idea. He didn't have to shoot the asshole if he just took the blond girl and put her somewhere safe away from the asshole and his wandering hands.

For months, Ned Simplot had been trying to sell him a used container from the potato fields so's he could store parts and tools that he kept in his old man's leaky shed. Ned kept telling him that somebody was going to break in and steal his tools. "Whyn't you use your brain instead a your dick and buy something you can padlock?"

Padlock. Key. He\'d been on his way to a garage sale when some story came on the radio about how they were using repurposed shipping containers for people to live in in Africa. That was what gave him the idea. He could fix up a potato container. Insulate it and make it livable for the girl. He already had the key. Now all he had to do was lock it.

He'd put in a call to Simplot the next day and like magic, a Sealand container was now backing into a spot he\'d cleared between his trailer and the collection of junkers he kept for spare parts. He set it right next to the trailerhe slept in so he could keep an eye on it. It would be easy to go back and forth when he wanted to watch the blond girl through the peep holes he was planning to drill and cover with a little door.

He\'d already bought a space heater. As soon as they unhooked the tractor, he\'d start to work on running electricity for lights and heat. Maybe he\'d even get her have a microwave so she could heat stuff up. It was fun to think of all the things he was going to do for her. He made notes on a clipboard. Blankets. Should he do a shopping run at the Povarello Bargain Basement? By the time people took bedspreads or quilts to the dump, they were pretty far gone. Back when his mom had been around, he remembered having sheets on his bed but then again, that was so long ago, maybe he'd just seen them on TV. He crossed sheets off the list. Penciled in *Sleeping Bag*.

He wisht he\'d thought of setting up the container for her to live in a lot earlier. Then he\'d have had time to look through stuff that people threw out for what he needed to furnish it. He\'d found some old dishes and silverware people had thrown out. And after the fire, he\'d hauled home the smoky mattress and box springs Margaret O'Leary had told him he could take.

He could smell the smoke of the fire he'd set at the nut house every time he went into the container. He hated the wet and cindery smell. It reminded him of the night of the fire when he realized his plan to impress the bitch had gone wrong.

Ned Simplot waved at him from the cab of his dad's K-whopper on his way out the rutted road. \"Lemme know when you want us to haul you some gravel. Damn pot holes are big enough to fall into," Ned called.

Fuck you and the horse you rode in on, Russ told himself. Who gave a rat's tiny turd about taking care of people\'s cars or trucks when they came to the dump? Everybody had trash they needed to get rid of. The place was a dump. What'd they expect? The fucking road to the Cabela's?

. IT TOOK OLD GIRL ABOUT SIX MONTHS to figure out that she was stuck in a Catch 22 for crazy kids. If you acted nuts---say you took the Etsy route and threw your breakfast bowl of Cheerios at Christian when he wouldn't pass the sugar or you smashed the mirror in the bathroom with your fist like Danny because you didn't like what you saw or you climbed on top of your therapist's desk and screamed to be let out as Old Girl had at the end of her first year, they just sent you backwards to re-experience Inner Horizons labyrinthine levels of Intensive or Transition or Stabilization or Aftercare.

If you acted normal, didn't engage, didn't misbehave, did all your chores, worked at being pleasant, turned in your DBT worksheets and did your homework on time, participated cheerfully in bowling and snowboarding and salsa dancing and trail running and whatever stupid R&R hike they tormented you with, you were treated as equally nuts. "Faking it." "Passing." "Severely depressed. "Obviously suicidal."

If she hadn't been suicidal when she came in to the Program, she certainly should have been by now.

No one got out on their own volition. You were stuck in Idaho like flies in Superglue, she thought. There was no incentive to the jailers for people to get well. Your parents---or in her case, her hard working, impoverished aunt and uncle---kept forking out the exorbitant fees and Dr. Hazey bought another Mercedes that he parked on the front curb so you knew that your fees had paid for it. The status quo staggered on. If she'd burned the money in a bonfire in front of her family, at least she could have gotten warm.

Old Girl was thinking these depressing thoughts when she and ten other residents of Healing House stood shivering in front of a depressing fire out in the middle of a silent and depressing wilderness. Josh, today's hike leader, had resorted to pouring a gallon of lighter fluid on the wet wood to get it to burn. After an initial whoosh of flame, the logs smoldered and spit and creaked, raising more smoke than fire.

They had started the hike to Pulaski Tunnel dry and warm, in relatively good spirits. Now, three hours later, they were sopping wet and freezing. They'd trooped up a mountain, breaking through crusted-over snow and slogged up to a flat meadow where Josh demonstrated how to build a snow cave. Survival time!

He'd divided the group into teams of three and he gave them a two-hour deadline to make their own caves. Old Girl got stuck with Reza who weighed about 95 pounds and couldn't keep his attention on a task if you tied him to the Ponderosa pine they built their cave next to. James was originally assigned to their team, but he convinced Josh that it was cruel and unusual punishment to put James be on the same team as the roommate who drove him crazy. So that left Old Girl and Essie to build a snow cave while Reza orbited around it driving them insane.

It was Esty's first weekend back from Stable after she'd stabbed Reza which in any other world would have made her an odd choice to partner with Reza. But since it was Inner Horizons and Easy was so pumped with whatever downers they were using to control her, that was that. On the four mile hike, she lumped along in her men's size 10 packs and size 22 red snow pants in sullen silence.

When the sky started to drizzle and spit, old Girl knew why death in the next minute seemed much more appealing. If somebody put her in charge, she'd push Etsy over a cliff face to put her out of her angry misery, then follow her over leaping with both feet into the chasm in a New York minute.

Unfortunately, all she was given were Idaho minutes, a euphemism for eternity, while they spent the next two hours digging deep, wet snow and forming it into blocks. She and everybody else sweated up a storm shoveling snow and forming blocks and before ten minutes had passed, they'd all stripped down to their tee-shirts and snow pants. Sans hats and gloves and jackets, they clawed and flung the concrete snow away into low rounded igloo-esque structures.

To Old Girl's surprise, Etsy took to snow removal. She was a one-woman excavator, chugging along like a machine with the one shovel each team was given. Why they couldn't all have shovels for the Sisyphean task of moving two tons of snow was anyone's guess. Welcome to Inner Horizons, a trip through interior and exterior and subterranean hell.

Reza wandered off during the digging to bug James, so Old Girl and Etsy hunkered down and concentrated on snow removal until they had a space big enough for maybe a fox or a small coyote to crawl into. The instructions were to construct walls that were three feet wide which was enough to conserve body heat. They'd followed Josh's instructions to create a round domed space and dig a trench below the level of the cave floor that would form a narrow tunnel for an entrance. Theoretically, the heat would rise and with three of them huddled together in the cave, their bodies would generate enough warmth to keep them alive in a snow storm. Theoretically.

At the end of two hours, Old Girl could barely shimmy on her belly through the passage to a dim, lumpen space that was impossible to turn around it. It felt cold and clammy lying on snow in your wet Capilene underwear shirt and rain pants that were soaked with sweat. Maybe you wouldn't freeze to death but you sure as hell would want to if you had to spend a night with Reza and Essie stranded in the woods.

Essie was outside, chugging away with the shovel, in some kind of unfathomable rhythm that Old Girl declined to interrupt. She lay on her back in the dim, claustrophobic space, listening to a muffled sound of whooping and shouting that was moving toward her in the grayish darkness. She was trying to imagine how much longer it was going to take for her and Essie to move enough snow to clear enough space for an Etsy-sized person, the hell with fucking Reza.

It was not that easy to flip onto her stomach with the ceiling nearly in her face and she stopped to consider how she was going to back feet first out of the skinny entrance tunnel when more whooping and hollering sounded above her.

Without warning, a giant weight whumpfed down on her back.

Old Girl's face was buried in wet snow in the well of her outstretched arms. It felt like a giant rhinocerous was standing on her head and back. It was dark and she had a nose and mouthful of snow and she could barely lift her head an inch to breathe because wet concrete encased her head to toe.

A cave in?

The astonishing idea that she couldn't move, that she was completely paralyzed, that she couldn't even wiggle or move her toes, in the suffocating blackness that surrounded her, was followed by the even more astonishing thought that she'd just been buried alive doing exactly what Inner Horizons had told her to do! She'd been following instructions to the letter and now she was being crushed to death and no more than a few feet from a dozen people, she was running out of air. I'm dying. There is a God. Her last cogent thoughts.

"Crap! Crap! Crap!" Somebody was singing a repetitive mantra that sounded like a rapper's prayer.

Old Girl came to on her back in the snow with Josh's mouth over her open mouth. He was giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which was slightly icky because she could taste left-over tuna fish on his breath and oddly, she could feel her own chest rise and fall with the strange sensation of someone blowing warm air and tuna-fish into her diaphragm.

She wanted to tell Josh she was all right. She wanted to say that she was okay, she was awake. She wanted to say she was conscious and aware that Reza was dancing next to Josh like a demented imp singing "crapcrapcrap" in a holy litany while Josh knelt above her and breathed for her into her lungs.

It seemed to take forever before she was able to wave one hand around or pat at him, trying to get his attention. She couldn't seem to put it together to turn her face away from Josh's mouth. Words wouldn't form though she seemed to be thinking the words and they wouldn't come out until she choked out a deep racking cough.

"Oh holy Christ, she's alive!" Josh cried.

Old Girl found herself hauled to a sitting position and Etsy, no longer sullen and wide awake, was slobbering on her neck and laughing and Josh was hugging her and laughing and pounding her on the back with tears in his eyes and Reza and all the other kids who'd been lurking in a worried circle were dancing around in the snow like they'd lost their minds.

Then it was her turn to pat Etsy who was now blubbering aloud, with tears running down her pillowy face, saying, "There. There. It's OK. I'm OK. I'm breathing."

The story was that Reza had started lobbing snowballs at James and Rachel and Paul while they worked on their snow cave and while Easy was busy shoveling and Old Girl was scooping out a tunnel for an entrance and then James and Rachel had joined forces with Reza and ganged up on Big Paul and a huge snowball fight with the other teams got rolling and when Etsy got hit in the back of the head with an ice clump, she chased Reza around the the snow caves with her shovel intending to brain him with it as payback. Reza, wiry and skinny and wicked fast, had no trouble running from Etsy but while he was running around her in circles and taunting her with names like Stanker and Tanker, he whipped around the Ponderosa pine where Old Girl and Essie used to lean their cave against, forgetting that they had been digging out the snow under his feet. Essie came after him, shovel raised, and Reza wiggled his skinny ass at her in a little war dance while jumping on the roof of their cave with both feet. As Old Girl understood it, when Old Girl had been thinking about crawling out of the hole backwards to see what all the noise was about, the cave fell in and buried her.

Fucking fuckity fucker Reza quite literally stood on top of Old Girl and did his mating gorilla dance. No wonder she felt like a Mack Truck had driven over her, she thought, as Etsy's pitying crying jag with her little gasps for air and wheezes finally slowed and the big girl's soft shoulders stopped shaking.

The fire and the gallon of lighter fluid that Josh threw in to start the flames were for Old Girl's benefit but because the logs wouldn't really catch, because they were wet and everybody was wet and cold and getting colder by the second, Josh frog-marched her down the trail half-supported by James and Etsy, the strongest people in the group. Old Girl felt light headed. Her ears still rang and though she didn't want to complain, her back felt like it was on fire. It felt good to have two people propping her upright and keeping her feet stumbling along between them.

Old Girl had an arm draped on Esty's shoulders and Etsy squeezed her at the waist. "If you were dead, I would have killed Reza."

She told Old Girl the news like a little gift. It was Esty's gesture of solidarity, an attempt to make amends for Reza being an idiot and a fuck-wad and a dick.

"Do it anyway," James said. "Then I won't have to keep him as a roommate."

They all laughed.

Reza was down in the front of the line next to Josh who was giving him insta-therapy of the basic, "You're an idiot" and "Don't you ever think?" variety. He plugged along, staring at his feet, and for one magic moment, when Old Girl saw the Inner Horizons blue van up ahead with the sky blue clouds she'd always laughed at, when she felt the body warmth and support of James and Essie flanking her on either side, it felt damn good to be alive.

**50.**

OLD GIRL WAS UNACCOUNTABLY MESMERIZED by Process Group the day after the snow cave fell in.

Eugene, who was Reza and Paul's therapist, asked Reza to read his accountability statement first. Old Girl had tried to sit in her usual spot, the chair everybody fought over that she liked to drag behind the couch, so she could stare out the windows and do her usual daydreaming.

\"None of that,\" Eugene said to her. "You're on the couch today." He fixed Reza with a judgmental eye and said, "Reza has something he wants to say to you.\"

Reza had the expression of a prisoner in front of the parole board, if the prisoner weighed 120 pounds and had a big Jewish schnoz and a case of ants in his home-boy pants.

He read from a much crumpled piece of paper in a halting, husky tone. \"Didn\'t think\...wasn\'t paying attention\...never meant\...horsing around ...,\" Old Girl caught perhaps one word in ten because Reza\'s voice tightened and stretched thin and stammered as he tried to breathe and express himself at the same time. She was watching his mouth, trying to make out what he was saying, when she felt a corresponding tightness in her own chest.

Oh holy shit.

Reza kept blinking like he was fighting back tears and Old Girl felt a matching heat and scratchiness behind her eyeballs. Shit no! this isn\'t going to turn into a cry fest, is it? The last thing she heard Reza say in his strangled New Jersey accent was \"So fuckin' sorry.\"

The crazy ass fruitcake lunged at her from the opposite couch and threw his skinny arms around her and before she knew it, everybody was on the feet and joining in a group hug, like a horrible, constricting football scrum. Etsy was pounding Reza on the back and Old Girl could feel her friendly blows through Reza\'s body, while Etsy seemed torn between congratulating the little shit and giving him shaken baby syndrome.

Everybody talked at once about their part in Old Girl's rescue.

James said \"I\'ve never shoveled snow faster in my life.\"

\"Do you know how hard it is to dig snow with nothing but your bare hands?\" Rachel's voice was as wobbly as her smile.

\"Josh screamed out 'Old Girl\'s gonna die under there' and we all went crazy,\" Manuela, who used to be Manuel six months ago he/she---they?---came into the program, said.

Everybody at Group wanted her to know how hard they fought to get her old. Old Girl had been blissfully in the dark, pressed down by what felt like a hundred tons of snow so she had no idea what they\'d gone through to get her out. People were showing off their hand scrapes and broken nails. \"It was easier to scoop without my fucking gloves but by the time we found your jacket, my hands were totally numb.\" Rachel said, holding out red and cold-chapped hands.

Old Girl had been in plenty of Group sessions where people cried and she thought she was inured to it. Somebody was always losing it, either with shame or grief or rage. But she had always been able to build up her own snow cave around her inner self with walls that were more than three feet thick. Now it felt like all those bodies furiously digging and shoveling with their hands and feet, were threatening her very foundations.

When she tried to extricate herself from all that body heat, yet another person would touch her touch her hair or pat her on the back or squeeze her arm, as if they were trying to reassure themselves that she was still alive.

Normally she turned her internal temperature down to minus-40 in Group. Now she was so hot, she was sweating.

The last time they\'d taken everybody to North Star to snow board, she\'d dropped a glove and it was so cold on the chair lift, the pinkie on her bare hand had begun to freeze. When she went into to warm up in the Lodge, the pinkie finger came down with a terrible case of pins and needles. Hundreds of sharp pricking points that hurt so bad she could barely breathe.

In the bathroom, when she\'d finally been able to extricate herself from the scrum, she felt like the horrible needles were back. Her heart was being poked by a thousands surgically sharpened points that made her long for the old deep freeze even though the walls seemed to be irrevocably cracked.

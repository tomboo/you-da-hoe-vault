051723 OG picks ponderosa puzzle pieces

On the way to Two Mouth Lake, Rachel surprised OG in the act of peeling a puzzle piece of bark off a Ponderosa tree. Why do you keep picking stuff off tree trucks? she asked.

"It smells like caramel," OG said truthfully. That was all she was prepared to admit. Why was it people at Inner Horizons couldn't keep their noses out of everyone else's business? If she wanted to offer up the smell of Ponderosa's inner perfume to Gabe, who hadn't lived long enough to smell it himself, what business was it of the new girl?

Rachel came up to the tree OG was standing next to and used her thumb to pry up her own puzzle-shaped piece of bark. She held it to her nose. "You're right. It smells good." But of course, she couldn't leave it at that. "Is that the reason you tear off the tips of the cedar trees too?"

OG wanted to tell the nosy snitch to go catch up to James and stop spying on her but then decided maybe it was better not to make a big deal out of her smell offerings to her dead. Would part of the truth satisfy when the whole truth was too personal to admit? She held out a green-tipped branchlet. "It's incense cedar. I just like the intense smell of it."

"That one's not incense cedar. It is a cedar, but some kind of variegated type. I can't remember what it's called."

OMG, it's wasn't enough that the Program saddled her with a roommate but of course, she had to be a brainiac botanist.

"What do you care what I smell? We haven't been outside in more than three weeks. It just feels good to smell something that isn't bleach." Margaret was an ehthusiastic cleaner but eco-sensitive, she was not. So, time to turn the tables. "What about your crush on James? How come you're back here bugging me?"

Rachel said, "I don't have a crush on James. What are you talking about?"

"So that wasn't James down on his knees back there adjusting your snowshoe?"

"I accidentally stepped on his webbing."

"You didn't do it on purpose? Everybody here is hot for James. Just don't let Lydia catch you or she'll eat you alive."

Rachel laughed. "She is kind of scary, even if she only weights 92 pounds." They walked up the trail that followed a burbling creek, then the girl really surprised OG by handing her a pale green stalk of a plant she didn't recognize. "Smell this. It's a weird one."

OG took the long onion-like stalk and ran her finger along it. Rough and abrasive She inhaled expecting the bite of onions but only got a hint of musk. She offered it up silently to Gabe like a prayer, anyway. "What is it?"

Rachel sped up ahead of OG on the trail, calling back over her shoulder. "It's called mountain death camus. It's not like I want a roommate either. Feel free to eat it."

OG blinked. So the kitty has claws.

Rachel's snowshoes kicked up a scrim of snow as opened up the distance between the two of them. A minute passed. The distance widened into a silent wood. So Rachel didn't want to be friends. Who gave a shit? OG didn't have time for friends, especially now that she was out of here. *Especially* now that she was out of here.

And like that, in the tick of an unseen clock, OG made her decision to really go.

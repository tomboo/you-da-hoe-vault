122418 Winter landscape in OG POV at Two Mouth

The winter landscape looked masculine and forbidding.

Bush stubble broke through snow like a man's beard. The color of hills without snow were also masculine, like men's khaki pwork ants and dark forest green work shirts and brown worn work boots made by White's in Spokane. No pastels or even light colors: always variants of khaki landscape in a cap without a logo, heavy green or bark-colored winter coat. Even his boxers were faded and pale, leached of color from many washings in iron-heavy water.

In Winthrop, the winter mounts were predominantly blue-white with pale swaths of yellow grasses sticking up through snow crust. Green pine trees were covered with snow. Lighter and greener close to the bole and blobbed with heavy snow out at the ends where weight accumulated. The trees looked Christmas tree flocked with weighted snow boughs drooping toward the ground. Everywhere snow touches, it weights the thing down.

In the early morning when it was still dark, the sky had started to lighten. The clouds hung low. Light limned the bulbous shape at the horizon line so there was a swath of light between the snow and the clouds like an upside down bathtub ring.

Light fixtures buried in the snow pooled yellow light around their low mushroom shapes. Beyond the golden ovals, the light on the snow looked blue, then icy purple where the light dimmed and was only reflected by snow.

Snow muffled sound. Footsteps on the thin dusting of snow were softer. The flakes swallowed up sound with softness under foot. Crunches sounded on the cement and asphalt. Om the \[arlomg ;pt amd rpadway, a thin layer of snow, maybe a quarter inch, covered ice with an occasional skating spot that gleamed under foot.

When you walk, you instinctively search out thicker snow to avoid slipping. You walk gingerly, aware of where your foot is stepping or you might fall.

Yellow willow trees weep against whiteness. Red sap rises in creek bushes like veins and capillaries of color.

The scrape of snow shovel is rough against bare asphalt, muffled when the shoven scrapes heavy snow. Scrap-whumpf.

Snow in an even dusting obscures the ice underfoot so what looks soft and benign holds a threat.The landscape looks pretty and pristine and benign but it always carries an edge of something beyond or under the beauty. Beautiful but... dangerous.

Low cloud cover obscures the tops of the hills. Ribbons of low fog curl in the ravlleys, ravines and coulees.

Homesteads, barns, houses, sheds, haystacks covered with tarps to hold off moisture from the stacked wood are separated by fields and fields of white and blue snow. It's broken up and dotted and stubbly looking until you get far away from the towns where the land empties out. Fences enclose larger and larger fields, pastures, then that barrier dissolves and the fences tive way to rising slopes with distant tree breaks that disappear into fog that's the same blank color as the snow.

120818 Queef word play and 2018 opening

James and Reza conversation or Rachel and OG?

"You know what queef is?"

"Something you shoot up or ingest?"

"It means "expulsion of air through the vagina."

"A vagina fart? Gag me!"

"I don't think they smell."

"Really?"\
"They just squeak."

"You know there's an English meal called bubble and squeak," said James, trying to change the subject

But does it come from the vagina, Reza wanted to know.

Hazey/purple drank

Purple drank. The word bubbled up and Hazey remembered a staff session where one of the therapists was discussing codeine -- or was it cough syrup---and what the kids like to mix with it. Or was that Circle-K? Wasn't that the store like 7-Eleven? If you mixed codeine and cough syrup and sprite with a purple Jolly Rancher, it was voodoo. Maybe he should buy some. He could use some voodoo in his life and if drinking a purple drank was required for the good of science, he was for it. Don Ho would approve, he thought, right before his head thunked to the desktop like a ripe melon.

Rachel was ashamed that she somehow let the baby go. She fell asleep and when she woke up, it had been spirited away and she did nothing to keep it close. "I could have screamed. I should have made noise, banged on the bars of the bed---something. All I did was go silent. I was stunned." She looked down at the keloided pink skin that ran across her wrists. "Then this." She looked up at James. "No help to the baby. But helpful to me. At least I thought it would get me away from the pain."

James could feel her wintry shiver of regret. The acid taste of shame in her mouth. It was as if he had entered her body and felt the pain of loss within her.

"How old were you when you had the baby?"

"Seventeen."

"You were a baby yourself," he said. Her bare hand was on the counter and he gripped her hand with both of his hands. "What could you do? You were a minor. Your parents were guardians of you and your baby."

"Some guardians," she said. "Why didn't they just let me die if they were so ashamed of me."

"Ashamed? They were trying to save you." He thought of his own parents' reaction when he blubbered out that he had walked away from the crash. James's mother, a neurosurgeon, had gone to the site of the crash in case she could help. James's dad took him straight to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion, broken ribs and a detached retina.

The next time he saw his mother, in his hospital room, she couldn't meet his eye. "Did you help her?" What he meant was, did you save her?

"She was gone, James. Nothing I could do."

For a moment, he misunderstood. "She walked away? But how\--."

His mother put her hand on his to still his questions. 'She probably died instantly. She hit the windshield. No seat belt."

He realized then that he and Rachel were gripping each other's hands as if neither one of them was ever going to let go. And then he was talking, talking, talking as the pressure in his chest blew out and the shame he'd bottled up came out in a horrible flow.

The harder the pressure on his hands, the more details came out of his mouth in a dirty ooze of caustic blame and regret and self-hatred. He could smell the stink of his words and was amazed that she didn't shrink back away from the ugliness and rot that ran and ran.

"You hit your head, James. You were concussed."

"And stoned and wired on lean and drunk on Tequila shooters, not to mention a hit of Circle-K. What was I thinking?"

"Same thing I was thinking when I slit my wrists. Get me away from the pain."

"Have you told your parents all this?" Rachel asked.

A vision of the reams of crumpled paper with his many efforts to explain that filled his garbage. "No, I can't."

She shrugged. "You just told me. And you didn't implode."

He reached across the table and wiped a wet track off her cheek. "But look. I popped my zit and it got on you."

"We've both got a lot to cry about," she said.

"Have you told all this to Josh?"

"He says I should tell my parents the facts."\
"But the facts are only part of it. The important part is how you feel about it."

"Not if you're the dead girl," Hames said bitterly. How he hated his craven self in that moment.

She said, "Look at me."

He obeyed. Her hazel green eyes contemplated him from her beautiful dark face and James couldn't see a hint of judgement or distaste.

"Tell Josh and your parents the real story."

"The real deal, you mean?"

The rill dill, she said.

His chest felt slightly easier, less pressurized and tight. It was easier to get air in to his lungs now that the ugliness and rot was out in the open. It still stunk. It would always stink. But at least he could live with it now that he'd admitted to himself what he'd done. He wondered if he should ask Mom and Dad to come to Couer d'Alene to hear it from the horse's mouth. Right animal, wrong end. Better to have them all in the same room so he couldn't look away.

Is this what Josh meant about not treating Rachel as a white person? Just treat her like a person? One with ears and heart and eyes that saw the ugly truth about James and didn't turn away?

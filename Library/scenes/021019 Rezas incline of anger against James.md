021019 Rezas incline of anger against James

First James apologised for "Monkey Boy" which Reza heard, but sloughed off, as always. It wasn't that his skin was thick or hardened, it was actually slickened, smoothed out and wicked fast from all the hits that fell to his feel in a river of stones.

"Monkey Boy's not the worst of it," he said. "What about Shit-for-Brains? I figured out how to make meth without blowing myself up. I'm not stupid."

James opened his mouth, closed it. Like a fish.

"I don't remember saying that."

"How about Midget, do you remember that? Gnat Boy? Mosquito and Shortie and Motor Mouth and 'Talks A Lot But Says Nothing?' "

Was it Reza's imagination or was James a whiter shade of pale. He played the guitar riff inside his head experimentally, to see if he helped him understand what he was seeing.

James hemmed and hawed. "I... hmmm. I guess... I do that a lot. Call you names, I mean."

"And fucking Apu. I hate Apu the most!"

James, now derailed, tried desperately to get back on track. He'd thought this would be easy. It was Reza, for God's sake, not Gandhi."

"And once, you even called me Ganhi. How many times do I have to tell you I'm not Indian, I'm Pakistani?"

"Gandhi was a saint," James said, diffidently.

"A Hindu saint, maybe. Not to Muslims."

"Oh, I guess I just didn't understand..."

"After all that other shit you called me, why apologize for Monkey Boy? Did you wake up in the middle of the night and get converted from asshole to Shiva H. Vishnu?"

James, nonplussed. Reza on a roll was Reza on a tear.

"Why now?" Reza repeated. "What brought on the Gandhi act to the lowly Muslim slave?"\
James said, without thinking, "Josh told me to."

"Oh!" Reza cried out triumphantly like he'd found a \$100 bill in a pile of dog turds. "Josh told you to. Did he also tell you to quit calling me 'Apu' because it's racist?"

Unsure how to extricate himself from this deepening circle of hell, James nodded.

"Let me ask you. Would you ever call Josh Apu or Monkey Boy?"

"No." James shook his head. "You know he outweighs me by forty pounds."

"And you outweigh me by forty pounds." Reza gestured to the small distance between him, shrunken in to the tiny corner, and James looming over him on half the bed.

James thought the weight difference was sixty pounds but didn't correct him.

"My point exactly. You don't expect me to fight back because I'm small and brown and I'm just Weirdo Boy when you deign to notice me."

Like all arguments, there was one moment when they were talking rationally and then an instant when rationality lifted off to Def Con 5. James noticed that Reza's body was quivering, he was so wound up. Josh had said it was going to be hard but he hadn't told James it would be like eating glass.

"Jesus, James, you're the clueless on. 'Apu' is a sterotype. Some white guy who doesn't know anything made him up and now every clueless white guy in America is calling every brown guy with an accentthe Indian who runs a Korean grocery store. I'm a Paki and I'd rather be called that than fucking Apu because at least it's correct!"

That's when Reza eeled himself out of the corner James had boxed him into like Houdini.

James had seen Reza wound up, but he'd never seen him shaking with barely contained anger. If Reza was a bomb, this was the moment of silence at the final 'tock.'

A sudden image of Reza's favorite, Dr. Pushwill, came to James like an apparition. Careful where you aim that thing, he heard the doctor saying.

At the door, stiff and outraged in a state of righteous dignity, Reza said, "Take your apology, White Boy, and shove it where the sun don't shine." He added a punctuation note to the statement and flipped James off.

The silence that followed was broken by a knock on their door. Dat-dat-pauuuusssse -- RAP!

Reza opened it. Big Paul hulked in the doorway.

James had the impression that he'd uncovered something. He'd unwrapped Reza's bandage and somehow, just the act of ripping off the protective covering encouraged something inside Reza to blow.

Free from the corner where James had thought they were having a friendly conversation, Reza became incensed and grow bigger and louder than usual and powerful in his righteous offense. James was used to seeing Reza below him; now he was so upright in his rancor, so enlarged by his sense of outrage, James felt he was seeing Reza for the first time. Boy to boy? No, man-to-man\-- no, more than that: human being to human being. James was for once feeling sub-human while Reza grew super-human in his disgust.

When Reza cried "Apu!", it was like something that had been growing in pressure and strength gave way. Suddenly, the wound opened and everything Reza had pushed down poured out in dark and ugly waves that made James blanch inside. He had no recollection of all the names he'd called Reza. They were all not-very-finely veiled insults: Short Stuff, Hairy Boy, Greasy Spot, Stinko, Put-Put, Dweeb, Dork-o, and on and on. The blandest, least offense in the long litany was 'Braniac' which, given its associations in a psychological treatment facility, wasn't saying much.

"I'm sorry," James said. "I didn't know."

"You don't have to know," Reza said with bitterness. "You're white and privileged. You can get away with clueless. Try that when you're small and brown and it will get you killed."

Reza's head came up. James got the idea that something else occurred to him and it fueled a whole new stream of thought.

"You were there, James. You know how it feel. When those guys in the truck were yelling at us."

All Reza's pent up outrange and anger at James' callous treatment streamed out of him in a white hot river of pass and odoriferous obnoxious smell that James had put there over the last 9 months with his clueless insults. He couldn't deny he'd said those things, not that he remembered half of them. They sounded like stuff he would say, semi-joking, semi-not. He'd used the names thoughtlessly, thinking Reza had a hardened carapace, not realizing that the insults and casual teasing had a vicious edge that hadn't bounced off but had burrowed their way into Reza. They'd seethed inside in warm darkness and now they were pouring out in splatter and reek all over their clueless source.

James to Rachel

"I apologized to Reza the other day."

"For what?"\
"For calling him Monkey Boy and Apu."

"Did you mean it?"

"Yes."

Rachel turned in profile to him, her liquid brown eyes shining and sad. James had the sense she was really seeing him in all his naked shame.

"That's good," she said. "You hurt him."

"I know."

"You hurt me too, when you said it."

"I know that too."

"Don't do it again or I"ll have to snatch you bald."

"Did your mother say that to you?"

No, Margaret said it. Same difference."

He smiled. She smiled. The tension he'd felt forever -- between her and him, between himself and Reza, between himself, his family and everyone else he cared about in his life, seemed somehow lessened. It wasn't gone. Apologies didn't work like magic. But once the crap was out, the healing could begin. It would take James years to learn how long it would take but at the moment, he could see that he would learn. That was better than the hopeless, closed, airless feeling he'd had before. The bandaid was off, let the healing begin. However slow and stumbling and pained.

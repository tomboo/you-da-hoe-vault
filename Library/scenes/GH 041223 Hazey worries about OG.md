GH 041223 Hazey worries about OG

Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, Old Girl was his only patient left. He'd had to drop all his other longterm relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of dreck of the administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections, and managerial problems he loathed?

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her? He'd fought tooth and nail to keep her on his crowded schedule though it was hell to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include this vestige of his past life. OG made him laugh. She continually surprised him and sometimes frightened him with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. And if he didn't get through to her, he was deathly afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to get through to Old Girl's depression and suicide ideation. Suicide had been so much of part of her life since her family was killed, Hazey couldn't seem to jolt it out of her system. It was like she'd been on the path to her own destruction for so long that the dirt walls had built up over her head while the path she walked sunk deep into granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair she couldn't see the stars above her.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit. He was also lazy. He was unproductive. He wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for pick-me-up before his session with Old Girl.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. And he couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a beautiful young woman would wear those moldy graying scraps mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with nine weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her hormones and her will to live and she buried it all in matted hair that made her look sexless and old.

He really wished she'd find a boy friend. Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horions from becoming a bed-hopping swap fest. But he would make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way than procreation, one of life's most creative urges. That goodlooking athletic boy from Malibu---John? Justin? Jamison?---he was fit and athletic and except for drug addiction and severe grief and PTSD as a result of killing a woman with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a good reason for the No Fishing Off the Company Dock rule. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at NICC now that she had graduated to taking classes after two long year in Intensive. If a kind boy, or girl, Hazey didn't care which one, got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought. The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the muscle relaxant calling "I love you" from his pocket.

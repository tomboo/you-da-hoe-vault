120518 Reza's carbuncle jones

RESA SAID ONCE THAT THE THING HE MISSED MOST about the technology they'd taken away was watching carbuncle popping on YouTube.

"What's a carbuncle?" James had asked.

"A boil with multiple heads."

When James didn't seem to be able to visualize it, Reza took it upon himself to educate him on boil anatomy learned from his viral YouTube hero, Dr. Pushwill. Apparently, specialization in large growth removal was a thing.

"Pushwill? You're making that up."

"Pushmiller." Reza stressed the 'mill' syllable but then he seemed to like 'Pushwill' better and said he'd earn a four on the Daily Quadrant by writing a thank you letter to Dr. Pushwill for his educational services.

James was thinking darkly about his own benighted letter of accountability, wishing he could wax on and loosen the pressure of evil-smelling keratin and dead cells that had built up an explosive force.

"I'll congratulate him on how he always knows how to stay out of the way! He starts to shove on the skin around it, man, and he has an unerring sense for when the thing is going to blow." Then Reza wents off on the story of seeing Dr. Pushwill spray his assistant JeanAnne in the neck. "She screamed and said she'd never get the stink out! Doc got her to laugh when he said any boil could be a lethal weapon if they weren't so hard to aim."

James felt sick to his stomach when he stared at the white paper he couldn't bear to write on. Would it hurt less if he let the truth blow. Or would the stink follow him around forever?

"Have you ever smelled one?" he asked, idly.

Of course Reza had.

His father, a New York investment banker, got one on his hairy back and Reza's mother, a nurse, operated on it on the kitchen table.

Ewww. James wondered how they could bear to eat on the table afterwards.

"Pure evil" was the way Reza described it. "Like something died in there and rotted while he carried it around for years."

This was not helping James get his own pus down on paper. He shoved thoughts of Reza's favorite pastime away and stared out the window. The pressure was building inside him but all he could do was stuff it down in a warm dank place and let it simmer. He hoped he had Dr. Pushmill's luck when it blew.

NaNoWriMo II

Today I\'m writing about a story that\'s bookended by death. You think Old Girl dies on the road and in reality she\'s reborn when she sees the reality of death when the garbage man crashes and a steering wheel punctures his chest and he bleeds to death holding her hand.

Other characters \-- James, the new girl with epilepsia, the sex nut and bulimic with the fucked up mother, the terrible cook \_\_\_\_\_\_ of trying to poison everyone in the Program, and Margaret, the house cleaner and common sense voice of life, everybody is trying to figure out how to live their lives. The factor that binds people together \-- or maybe it separates them into non-binding atoms \-- is that all the residents are supposed to be crazy. In fact only the external characters \-- the psychiatrist they call Dr. Lazy and Crazy, and the psychotic garbage man are definitely nuts.

The story has two villains. Dr. Lazy Crazy and the Garbage Guy who needs a name. Some of the kids\' parents are crazy too: the sexy fuck-up\_\_\_\_ in pants girl has a serial marrier for a mother, some of the parents are born again or fundamentalists or too crazed with work to pay attention to the cries for help from their children.

Many events from the natural world present moments of grace.

On the play day hike to a frozen lake they see a moose who\'s fallen through the ice drown. A coyote flashes eyes red and feral in the headlights of the garbage man\'s truck on the road from town toward the residential house; it\'s the coyote who causes the garbage man\'s truck to swerve and hit a Ponderosa Pine missing Old Girl\'s supine body lying in a dip at the bottom of a hill. Other moments of grace: Margaret, the housekeeper, makes homemade tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches when the vile cook gets ptomaine poisoning from some soup she\'s kept in the fridge too long and the kids feel with common sense and love, stop their bickering and trash talking to taste something a woman made with her hands because she cares for them. Moose, coyote and simple homemade meal, what are other moments of grace? The weather in \_\_\_\_\_\_ Idaho is constantly \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ commentary with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ stars and frost crystals that gleam and crunch under one\'s boots. It\'s winter in this novel, a dead time, but when Old Girl leaves the truck after the garbage man dies, she\'s headed to spring.

What is the time frame of my novel?

It feels short, like a few days in the dead of winter, when in truth it could be until late March or early April. Maybe it\'s a month between winter quarter and spring quarter at Idaho Community College where only losers and rednecks take classes. What fits with the emotional landscape of the story about living in the present in some \_\_\_\_\_\_ way. That\'s an all seasons choice. Dr. Lazy is going to Idaho to get away from endless winter. The garbage man has never been away from rural Idaho where he keeps his guns and traps small creatures and watches them die in their traps. Can\'t think of many signs of spring until later. Marjorie brings hyacinths into the house and the kids can\'t figure out where the peppery sharp smell of life has come from. The winter animals are mostly hidden; the occasional track of a lynx or pitter pat trail of a rabbit or of a fox visiting the garbage dump for a handout.

It\'s a close-up picture of a residential treatment facility where rich parents put kids they don\'t know how to deal with. I\'d like to take a page from the wire when the bad characters have some good and the good ones have bad behavior. Nobody is black and white even though that\'s the prevailing color scheme of winter.

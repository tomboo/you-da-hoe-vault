James Reveals His Fuck Up

\"Want a bite?\"

Rachel was eying his burger with a look of longing. \"Why didn\'t you order one if you\'re hungry?\"

\"It\'s not that easy to admit if you want something."

Wasn\'t that the truth. James wanted so much, in the middle of the night to not wake up to horrible screaming. The sight of blood.

He cut his burger in half and slid it over on the french fry plate. Then he ate his in about three bites while she was elegantly cutting hers into bite-size bits that she speared with his fork and ate one at a time. It was so controlled, almost an elegant performance, so much in contrast to her graceless lunge and ball drop on the bowling lane. Same story on the ski slope where she careened and slid on her butt, one foot dragging the snowboard like an anchor. She was tall and gangly, built like him, he realized, but not quite in command of her limbs. He remembered feeling the same way when he was 12, the year he shot up 5\" and felt like his body had gotten away from him.

\"What are you looking at?\" she asked.

\"You,\" he said. It was true. It was hard to not look at her and want to hold her hand.

> \"So tell me why you\'re a fuck up.\"

The terror and helplessness of holding her kicking and jerking legs was in his thoughts. How he wanted to help her. To stop the involuntary and embarrassing loss of control with her eyes rolled up in her head and her feet drumming the floor, despite James\' efforts to keep her still.

\"I killed a girl,\" he muttered.

\"How?\"

\"I was driving. We were drunk and stoned. I went off the road in Topanga Canyon and we rolled.\"

\"Is that how you hurt your shoulder?\"

He nodded, feeling the ghost of the ache that was like a reminder that he couldn\'t ignore.

\"She died in the crash?\"

Why did it feel like he was flaying himself alive? His moves felt raw and exposed, yet he sat forward and plowed on. She\'d exposed herself to him in all her ugliness and most vulnerable. It only seemed fair.

\"Worse than that,\" he said. \"I woke up and got out of the car and left her to walk home. She bled to death.\"

\"Did you know she was hurt?\"

\"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"There was blood all over.\" Who would have thought so much blood in her? Macbeth and the shame those words inspired in him the first time he read them.

\"Was she close to you?\"

\"Right next to me in the passenger seat of the Corvette that flew apart like a cardboard car in the crash.\" He shook his head. \"She asked me for a ride home. I didn\'t even know her name until later.\" Later, meaning when the cop who interviewed him when he was being charged with manslaughter and reckless driving, told him it was Charlotte Shantz and he thought it was just his luck to kill a girl named Chance.

He realized belatedly that Rachel had reached across the table. She held one hand with both of her hands, covering the top and the bottom with long fingers like a protective shell. \"I know,\" she said. \"I know.\"

The low words. The warmth of her fingers. The crappy café with the odor of French fry grease and the fog of bar smoke was an odd place to get forgiveness but James wasn\'t about to complain.

\"Hurts,\" he said.

\"I know,\" she said.

It had been months and months of therapy sessions and Group Groping and calls with his bewildered and frightened parents and he\'d never been able to talk about that night. The blood he\'d wiped on the cheat grass to get it off his hands. The way the girl \-- finally he was able to name her Charlotte \-- had been breathing high in her chest. He\'d tried to rouse her but she\'d been so far under in her unconscious dream land all she would do is groan. He\'d had vertigo and it seemed like it took forever to climb the rock strewn slope the car had tumbled over. Big chunks of fiberglass and what looked like brown paper backing dotted the hillside. A door panel. Part of the hood. A piece from the trunk with a chrome fender nearby. It looked like the car had exploded and unbeknownst to him, he found out what he thought was steel and metal was nothing but flimsy paper.

No wonder there was so much blood. When he walked away from the girl still strapped in her seat by the seatbelt there was almost no car around her. Just chassis and tires and a dashboard.

He didn\'t remember getting home, that some good Samaritan given him a ride and dropped him at the security gate at his parent\'s house. He couldn\'t remember the code and had to lean on the buzzer and tell Lupe the maid to come. his mother drove down the driveway and took one look at him and drove him straight to the hospital. After that it was all a blur.

Now he knew that the girl had been breathing her last with a \_\_\_\_\_. And wind ruffling her henna-red hair. Alone while James was being ferried to the emergency room like a prince.

The thought of what he had done just about cracked his chest open. He looked at her catsup on the plate and wondered if the sight of red would always make him want to lay his head down and howl.

He didn\'t want forgiveness. He wasn\'t expecting a benediction or blessing or relief from his guilt. It wasn\'t being fair. She\'d revealed her own self at its ugliest, not that she had any control over her epilepsy or how it commandeered her body and threw it into an alien nobody recognized. James felt like a kindred spirit. His body \-- the one he was so used to depending on for his balletic leaps at the basket and his swoopy throws \-- his body had betrayed him at the crucial moment. It had walked him, hurt and limping, while he held his forearm against his middle so it didn\'t bring him to his knees with pain, up the side of mesquite strewn slope away from someone he should have saved.

Jesus. How Rachel could even look at him in his naked ugliness, he didn\'t understand.

Margaret Confronts Hazey to Negotiate a Paying Job

What are the stakes? Hazey doesn\'t want to be exposed. his license will be revoked if he\'s caught using drugs and writing prescriptions for kids no longer at the program. Margaret wants the cook\'s job and she\'s willing to go to night school to get dietician credentials if Hazey will pay for the classes.

What\'s the instigating event that Margaret uses in order to play this card?

I would like to knit several threads together here.

Margaret would play her card when Hazey wants to get out of \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_ in she can mercilessly talk the good doctor into something when he wants to get her out of his hair. Grinchin gets a job offer? Grinchin gets pregnant and announces it\'s a virgin birth? Is it Hazey\'s baby? Boy howdy, Hazey better get Gretchen out of Dodge before Mrs. Hazey comes back from her month at the fat spa.

Kid involvement? One of the kids gets food poisoning from Gretchen failing to throw out some old turkey soup in the back of the fridge. James and Reza, the boys who are always hungry, and Gabe the new kid, who\'s just come in from wilderness camp and nobody knows what deep dark fuck ups he\'s living yet. Three boys Margaret finds puking their guts out and after cleaning up a mess in the hall where James cannot make it to the bathroom because Reza was using the toilet to puke himself dry, she marches into Hazey\'s office where she finds Grinchin in tears and Hazey in a state.

If Hazey impregnated Grinchin, he\'d have to help her. What if she\'s pregnant by one of the randy boys? Hazey won\'t have to get rid of her. One of the other therapists? No fishing off the company dock. The treatment program is just another fucked up little business with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ employees in addition to crazy kids and crazy parents and sometimes Margaret believes she\'s the only non-fruitcake in the bunch.

Margaret is on her white horse and her royal charger and she\'s wearing one of those helmets \-- the ones with horns that the opera singers wear \-- she\'s so over the top mad. A huge puke splash in the hall that splattered above the chair rail for God\'s sake. That James must have a stomach like an exploding device. Margaret had never seen a kid blow chunks that far and wide. This was after Reza had puked around the toilet in the room he and James shared, as if he\'d been so poisoned the kid couldn\'t keep his head over the bowl.

It had taken Margaret a while to piece together the parts of the puke puzzle. She\'d found the turkey tetrazzini soup still in the refrigerator, after quizzing both boys about what they\'d eaten that none of the other kids had had. She smelled the soup. It had a sweetish smell, odd for turkey and noodles, with Gretchen\'s boiled beans the standard nutritional aid she\'d added to bulk it up. Margaret remembered her boiling a pot of navy beans and then leaving the pot on the stove for the past tow days. Gretchen had been distracted. Snappish. Then she got the call from Coeur d\'Alene clinic and she\'d told everybody she was sick and had to go home. Bat out of hell, was more like it. Had she left the beans out without refrigeration all day and overnight and then used them in the soup?

Margaret banged into Hazey\'s office without knocking. Her intention was to give it to him with both barrels when she realized Gretchen was on the therapy couch and Hazey had a box of Kleenex he was holding out to her.

\"This is private!\" Gretchen snapped. Her nose was the color of a fire engine and her mascara ringed her eyes in a raccoon mask of grief.

\"Not on your life!\" Margaret cried. \"Just the two people who need to hear this.\" She glared at Hazey and pointing to Gretchen said, \"She nearly killed two of the kids! Reza and James have food poisoning.\"

Both Hazey and Gretchen stared at her.

\"How?\" Hazey said.

\"They ate her turkey soup and they\'ve been puking since 4 a.m.\"

\"I didn\'t do anything!\" Gretchen cried.

\"You sure didn\'t. You left the beans out when you rant out of here like a bat out of hell and they must have gone bad overnight.:

Gretchen promptly burst into tears noisy racking sobs that made Margaret want to slap her.

Hazey handed her another Kleenex and said automatically, the way he\'d said it a million times to a million traumatized kids, \"Blow. You\'ll feel better.\"

\"I\'m not going to feel better, you asshole. I\'m pregnant!\"

It was Margaret\'s turn to open her mouth in a silent Oh.

\"Who\'s the father?\" she said. Gretchen was so skinny it occurred to Margaret she wouldn\'t be surprised if Gretchen was still a virgin. Her assessment of the woman went up a quarter inch. At least she wasn\'t pinched down there.

Hazey said,\" It\'s Brady Udall.\"

\"Are you getting married?\"

\"That\'d be kind of difficult seeing he\'s still married to his first wife,\" Hazey said. \"Gretchen and I were just discussing her options.\"

A dawning joy seemed to build in Margaret\'s size double DD chest. Sleeping with a fellow employee. What\'s there something about that in the Employee Manual? Add in food poisoning, by the registered dietician no less, and firing seemed only slightly better for her than a firing squad.

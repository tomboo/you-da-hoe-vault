04122023 James Shames Reza about sex

Dark red flushed Reza's already swarthy skin. He'd been lying about having a girl friend. Lying about all the sex they were having. How could he have even kissed a girl when he was convinced deep down inside that no one would ever want him unless he paid them?

What James couldn't credit was the level of detail: the color of Susan's eyes, the dark silky hair that hung between her shoulder blades, how smooth it felt, so different from Reza's wiry poky hair that felt like a wire brush if he didn't oil it flat to his scalp.

"Vaginas don't smell bad. Not during sex."

Reza looked askance. "Pee comes out of it! How can that be?"

A strange thought stole over James. How in the hell could Rez be so into Renate with the big boobs and the fondness for sex in closets and yet be so clueless? "Renata isn't into oral sex?"

"What?"

"Your tongue? Her pussy?"

"Of course she's into it." Reza looked affronted like he was doubling down on an imaginary friend.

"It's kind of weird that you don't know what she smells like if that's true."

Reza was silent. A red flush was climbing his neck above the Romantasy Rocks tee shirt he loved.

"Renata is real, isn\'t she?"

"She's real," Reza gave an empty-handed shrug. "In my mind, she is.

Ever after, James understood this revelation with the same disappointment of realizing the Velveteen Rabbit wasn't real.

"I'll kill you if you tell anyone."

The last thing James was thinking about was how Reza could hurt him. James was thinking of a specific and colorful story about how gleefully Reza had fucked Renata against a wall. Reza stood 5'5" tall on a good day. His legs were hairy and spindly and bowed. He called his biceps "sick pythons" when it was a stretch to call them corn snakes. Yet Renata was tall with a prodigious ass and boobs that he liked to bury his face in up to his ears.

"Not my story to tell," James said, truthfully. Then, to get rid of his shamed and despondent face, he added, "Better go get Margaret's lunch cookie before she scarfs it."

Reza slunk out of the room while James continued to contemplate all the stories about sex around the clock where Reza and Renata were always almost getting caught.

Did keeping James' mouth shut about Reza's virginity belong on the positive column of his accountability letter?

Or did the list of all the lies and obfuscations and blaming other people for things he had done still stink up their shared room?

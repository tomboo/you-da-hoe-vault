4:13 AM

LEAVING BEHIND THE WAKING KITS AND THEIR WHINES, a coyote pads her usual trail. Stops for a drink in the river. Then skirts the edge of dark trees, pads across an open meadow and climbs up a hill toward the death road, silent at this time of night of its bright lights and noise.

She can smell a far distant vole, now hidden deep under the snow, safe in its subterranean nest. Her stomach rumbles, reminding her of its growing pinch, the crying of hungry kits a mile away from the rush and tumult of the river.

She edges through the trees and climbs the snowy slope, swinging her muzzle side to side, gathering in familiar smells of cheat grass and vetch and aspen shoots crushed in the snow piles next to the road. Snow snapped boughs of pines droop, releasing resin from the snow's weight. A faint tinge of exhaust and oil and diesel register as past, not present dangers.

On a freshening breeze, an interesting smell reaches her --- something promising enough to make her pause before stepping over the edge and onto the road. Something foreign, edible, maybe rotting, that she half remembers smelling on a trot down a back alley looking for an off-kilter garbage lid or something piled too high for a metal rim to pinch shut against her.

She pads further down the road to investigate. Curiosity-killed-the-coyote wary. Ready to turn and flee, she picks her way toward a dark shape in the road that wasn't there on her dawn hunt. What\'s it doing? It's not moving. A slight wiffle of frosted breath rises and hovers a few inches above it, as if it\'s trying to cover itself with a small fog of life.

The coyote is drawn against her wariness by the smell. Something \-- meat? cheese?\-- is near and she salivates though she knows whatever is in the road might not want to give it up.

Torn between the desire to come closer and stopped by fear of the unknown, the coyote freezes to take stock.

Then it's lit up by unnatural brightness. A roar of death.

She springs to safety an instant before the snow bank she's paused in front of flattens with a crash that tears the night.

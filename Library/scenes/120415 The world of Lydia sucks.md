120415 The world of Lydia sucks

Lydia stood in her stocking feet in the frigid tub enclosure. It felt like she was stranded block of ice. She was waiting for James to make his way to the bathroom off the family room for stand up sex but he was taking forever. Was he waiting for her to be carried off by the frigid wind she could feel oozing in through the single paned bathroom window?

The longer time lengthened, the madder Lydia got. What in hell was taking James so long? Time was like that at Inner Horizons. You were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward or and a 50-50 chance that you were going to go backwards if you misbehaved or fucked up.

By the time James shoved the shower rings open, Lydia was already clawing her way up his long, thin body and scissoring her legs around his waist. She groped at his belt buckle, trying to undo it and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!" She was feeling like the top of her head was going to blow off.

"No!" James pushed at her hands and shoved at the death grip she had around his hips. "I can't. What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" she cried, patting and pushing at the area below hi belt, looking for evidence of the welcome she was expecting. When she came up flat, she said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way her eyes rolled up in her head in that fit?"

He kept pushing at her but her years of gymnastics and ballet tightened the scissors grip on his hips so she ended up being pushed slowly toward his ankles. She felt like a donut being worked down to his shoes.

"Don't hold out on me. I need it."

"I'm not holding out. I can't..." James paused as if he was seeking the right word but in Lydia's mind, all she could feel was a volcano of heat and rage moving up her legs to her crotch and she slapped him as hard as she could with one hand.

"What the hell? Why'd you do that!?" James's cheek flushed bright red where her hand had lit his skin like a flare.

"I want sex. Give it to me."

Now the flush looked more like a trouble light on James's pale cheek. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly enticing me."

They were both breaking like they'd run a long distance. James had managed to scrape her off his body and he was backing up toward the rear of the tub with an expression of disgust.

"You're a dickless wimp," she said. "Fucking wimp."

"Now you're calling me names? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

She threw out the worst insult she could call up from the pressure that was rising in her chest. "I get it. You're gay, aren't you?"

He was stepping over the porcelain basin to the floor, the curtain rings jangling like an alarm bells, when he got his hands on the porcelain door knob.

"You faggot!" she screamed. She didn't give a shit how many demerits or punishments she got or who heard her berating him. If James wouldn't get her off before she met her mother in an hour, she was going to implode anyway.

"Why would I fuck you? You're a crazy bitch," he cried.

The door to the bathroom shut before she could think of anything worse to fling at him. She let her body slip down the wall and laid her head on the smooth white surface. It felt like he'd abandoned her on an ice flow out of sight of land.

Her mother laughed when Lydia wanted to climp up on her lap. She pushed at her small hands in order to hold her away from her skirt the way that James pushed her away from his belt buckle.

All she had wanted was to get close. To feel his heat, to warm up with hot sex and gushing body fluids and that feeling---even if only for a fleeting moment---of bodily connection.

"I can't," he said again. "That girl's fit... I can't even think about sex right now."

"Don't think," she cried. "all you have to do is feel." She scrabbled at his hands, holding tight to his waist with her legs while his superior weight inched her body down his legs like a donut.

That's when volcanic rage took over her. She forgot her coldness. She was so hot, it felt like a furnace blast of anger was fueling her.

"You fucking faggot!" she cried. "You can't get it up. You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked up in surprise. The red on his cheek bones where she slapped him burned brighter in his pale blue-white skin.

"Limp dick! "she screamed, slapping him again as hard as she could. "Dickless wonder!" Another slap.

He got hold of her hands and held her upper body away from him while her lower body scissored him about the hips. "You're nuts! Fucking certifiable. Can't you think of someone else for a goddamn minute?"

The clock ran forward for a short time but then if you earned a demerit for failing to take the trash out or you fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed or you wouldn't participate in some stupid game during Process Group, the clock would turn around run backward away from you. Lydia would think she was heading toward more perks or weekend recreational passes or a chance for a week long trip home and just when she thought she was inches from her goal, the crazy clock would rewind and she'd find herself back at ground zero.

If she had known the clock was broken, she could have accepted it but the fact that the clock ran fast sometimes and slow at others and then took a god-awful leap backward to put her at zero over and over again, made her hopeless with despair.

042514 what we need here are raccoons

No title

Carla fought with the nurses. She got it into her head that she wanted floor mats between the bed and the bath and the head nurse said no and Carla said, \"I\'m the one dying not you.\" And there was a Mexican standoff that day until the head nurse stood down. How you trump \" I\'m dying so I get what I want.\"

Carla told \_\_\_ her hair cut made her look like a dyke. \"Fuck you, I\'m dying. I can say what I want\" was the \_\_\_

She told me I liked my friend Nina more than I liked my own sister. In that moment it was true but that wasn\'t the moment we \_\_\_to fight till it was over.

In [Machlemore\'s]{.underline} should the house light so dark [arid]{.underline} he says \"This is the moment.\"

Raccoons. What we need to break this up are raccoons.

Somebody calls out-- a firefighter? The fire chief? -- and Rachel hears them say, \"What the hell?\"

The crowd of refugees from the house wrapped in blankets, huddled in pajamas and spare coats someone grabbed from the front hall, all turn en masses to the half circle of pines that surround the house. Lights front half a dozen flashlights play around branches.

A pink starburst glows above, up one of the trees. Beady black eyes set off by a narrow black mask peer out from the neon pink polka dot like a face in a radioactive flower.

Another flashlight hits a Day-Glo green splat-- same feral face in the center of an unnatural neon splat. One by one all the radioactive colors [­­­\_\_\_]{.underline}- dot the dark branches like dreams from a strange Day-Glo vision.

\"Coons?\" one of the firefighters says. \"What\'s wrong with them?\"

\"Are they sick?\"

Rachel joins the kids from Healing House distancing herself from the firefighters who are watching them like they\'re afraid to turn their backs.

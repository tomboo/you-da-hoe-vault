010519 OG sees Rachel overtaken by electricity

OG had never seen the body take over and drive itself. In her experience, even in extreme pain and grief, she'd always been in charge an now, Rachel seemed to have disappeared and her body was doing its own dance and creating all kinds of alien moves. Who is that? She thought. It's not Rachel.

It looked like an electrical charge. A lightning bolt, maybe. It animated her. Somebody breathed, "Freddie Krueger." But it was more alien. More primitive. Rachel seemed plugging into an electric source that kept circulating. It zapped her. Her heels danced. Sound tattooed off the floor. Her neck arched. Her teeth clacked. It didn't even look like she was in her body. It looked like someone else shoved Rachel into oblivion and took charge.

James was wide-eyed, appalled. "What should we do?"

"No!" Darlene barked at him. "Stay away from her mouth. She'll bite you." He looked like the news hit him in the solar plex. "Grab her ears. Hold her like a jug."

Jesus. Only Darlene could turn an epileptic fit into a rodeo.

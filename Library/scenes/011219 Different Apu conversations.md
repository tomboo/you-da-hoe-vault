011319 Different conversations about Apu

"Who's Apu?" Margaret asked.

"Don't you watch the Simpsons?\
"My husband does."

"He's the Indian guy. The one who runs the little store."

Margaret went home and Googled Apu. A small brown man who reminded her of what Reza would look like at middle age. She couldn't figure out what Reza didn't like about the little man but it was clear to her that calling him 'Apu' didn't sit well. She made a note to take James aside and tell him to knock it off.

OG and Rachel

"He's kind of clueless. He's always calling Reza 'Apu.' It drives Reza nuts," said OG.

"You mean Apu from the Simpsons? The little guy?

"The Indian shopkeeper," OG said.

"What's so bad about that?"

"Reza isn't Indian. He's from Pakistan."

"That's lame."

"He's pretty mean to Reza." OG turned the page where the boys were turning against Piggy. "Reza's annoying as shit though. I'm glad I don't have to live with him."

"Glad to know I just moved up a run on your ladder."

"Don't get cocky. Maybe you and Reza share a rung"

"Because he's brown and I'm black?"

"Crap! No. That's not what I meant." A minute or two later, OG said, "You know they've never heard of Pakistan in Idaho."

"Tell me about it. I'm the only black person in the state. They all think Reza comes from the reservation."

"He does, kind of. The rez of Inner Horizons where everybody is a pariah."

"Glad to now I'm with my peeps."

OG gestured to Rachel's book, lying open on the crazy quilt. "How are you liking Pariahs in a Strange Land."

Rachel looked at the Heinlein sci-fi cover. "It's OK. Makes you think."

"About James? That's interesting."

"He is gorgeous."

"Too bad he's clueless, not that Lydia gives a shit about his brains."

"They're an item?"\
"If giving blowjobs is an item. Lydia's a nympho."

"No wonder we're pariahs."

"What can I say? Every DSM in the book."

Margaret and Lydia

Margaret studied Lydia while she at a monkey's nibble of cheese and one slice of apple. At this rate, it was going to take her an hour to finish three hundred calories.

"Why do you and James call Reza 'Apu?'"

"Because it pisses him off," said Lydia, without missing a beat.

"Who's Apu? Someone you go to school with?"\
"From the Simpsons. You know. The little guy who runs the store."

"I don't watch much TV."

"Neither do we because you won't let us," Lydia said, with some bitterness.

"Not my rules," said Margaret. "I just enforce them."

"Apu is the little brown guy. The Indian. Lydia spoke in a high, sing-songy accent. "I want you to get out and go to hell and thank you and come again."

Margaret shook her head. No idea.

Lydia tried again. "Shiva H. Vishnu. What was that?"

Margaret said doubtrfully, "Maybe I remember him." Down went a minuscule amount of cheese. Watching Lydia eat was like watching paint dry when it was just about to rain. Get on with it! Margaret gestured to the food on Lydia's plate. "Come on, hurry it up."

"I'm watching my weight," Lydia said it primly. "Not like some people."

"I'm watching my weight too," said Margaret. "It's always going up."

"That will never happen to me."

"You'll be surprised. Your metabolism changes as you get older." Especially when donuts and apple fritters and whole baskets of chips jump into the grocery cart of their own accord.

"Quit with the Apu talk. It's mean and it's hard on Reza."

"Reza's hard on everybody else. He deserves it."

"What do you think it is that bugs him," Margaret asked, really wanting to know. It sounds like Apu is funny."

"He's a stereotype. And he's Indian," Lydia said. "And Reza is from Pakistan.

Margaret had no idea that it made any difference. "Well, lay off it anyway or I'll have to give you a one."

"Trade you an apple slice for an Apu," Lydia said, holding out her plate.

"Deal." Margaret took the applie slice and ate it with a piece of cheese. "What? She said when Lydia laughed at her finishing off her lunch. "I'm watching my weight. This is just a healthy snack."

Lydia grabbed her beautiful leather bag with the Italian label Margaret didn't recognize either. Balenciaga. No doubt it was as expensive as her fancy boots.

"I don't get why that's offensive," Margaret said. "Apu is funny, if I remember him right.

> "You know Reza is from Pakistan?"\
> "I thought he was Indian. Aren't they close to each other?"

Margaret's grasp of geography wasn't any stronger than her grasp of history. There was some kind of war between the countries back in the day, she thought. British partition? People stabbed or murdered on a train? What that had to do with Reza and his complaints about racist comments from his peers, she didn't really know. They'd had a discussion about it at Staff Meeting.

"We just do it to annoy him," Lydia said.

"Well, quit doing it. It's hurtful."

"How are we supposed to entertain ourselves? You took away the TV and all our electronics. It's a desert here."

"Doesn't mean it has to be a war zone. It's not worth it. Reza can't help being ADD."

"What?"

Lydia was smiling at her. What a difference those lovely teeth made to her usual resting bitch face. Then she realized Lydia had slid her plate close to her and Margaret was absently eating the girl's cheese.

"Shit!" she cried. "You tricked me."

"Go ahead," said Lydia. "Trade you an apple slice for an Apu."\
Margaret watched her own hand reach out and pile a piece of cheese onto an apple slice, like it belonged to someone else. "You!" She was laughing helplessly with Lydia. "Now I'll have to give myself a one for eating your lunch."

"Could be worse, Margaret. I could have called you 'Homer.'"

The girl skipped off, seemingly in a better mood. Busted, Margaret thought, absently touching her finger to the cheese crumbs in order to hoover them up.

OG and Rachel

"Reza is Pakistani. He's not Indian."

"That's lame. What is James thinking?"

"His dick is doing the thinking for him."

"With Reza?"

Rachel's expression fell and OG had to correct her. "James isn't gay or bi, as far as I know. I meant with Lydia."

"What's the story there?"

"No story. Just blowjobs and hookups whenever they get the chance."

"I thought sex was against the rules."\
"Since when has that ever stopped anybody?"\
"Yeah," said Rachel, holding up one wrist like a pink corsage.

"At least you're not a motormouth like Reza."

"No. I'm not a blabber. That's the only thing my mom likes about me."

"Just a garden variety cutter."

"Takes one to know one."

OG held up her own wrists with the stupid horizontal pink scars from grade school. Rachel's vertical scars were the real deal. Angry and purple, so fairly fresh. "Who saved you?"\
"My dad broke the bathroom door down."

"Kids," OG said. "We're hell on the furniture, aren't we?"

"If I had a knife now, I'd show you."

OG contemplated that offering in silence, thinking of the aftermath of a double suicide in Room #8.

"I'd hate to make Margaret clean up the mess," she said. "I owe her."

"For what?"

OG was thinking about the boy nobody knew who died in Margaret's arms earlier in the week but she wasn't up to telling Rachel the story. Too late for that kind of bonding when she had to get up in the dead of night.

"Sorry," she said. "I gotta get some sleep. I'll tell you another time."\
A lie. But a permissible one. She'd be long gone before Rachel could talk her into describing Margaret's stricken face.

***Sense of Place on the Page* \~ Wendy Call \~ Sample Chapter Excerpts \~ [Draft]{.smallcaps}**

*Included here are excerpts from two of the book's chapters: Chapters 4 and 9. These excerpts are works in progress, each about half of the material from a complete chapter.*

**Chapter 4: Places We Play**

> "Our attention is precious, and what we choose to focus it on has enormous consequences. What we choose to look at, to listen to---these choices change the world."
>
> \~ Thomas L. Fleischner, "The Mindfulness of Natural History", 2011

"We are what we pay attention to," natural historian Thomas L. Fleischner likes to say. He means this literally; he is referring to neuroplasticity. The neurons in our brain are linked together in neural networks, which develop as we experience and learn new things. As a person observes, does, or experiences something over and over again, the neural networks in the brain grow stronger. The networks' firing threshold lowers---that is to say, less stimulation is needed to activate a particular neural network. As a result, the person will recognize a particular pattern with less auditory or visual information than was previously required. Not only is that person able to identify a sight or sound more readily, but will actually need *less* visual or auditory data to see or to hear.

Whether we spend our leisure time binge-watching television series on Netflix, watching the batter give hand signals to his team's catcher, or admiring the colors of 250 million-year-old rock formations at a national park, our day-to-day activity affects us neurologically. The connections between our brain's neurons proliferate or wither based on how and where we focus our attention.

As writers seeking to recreate the places we have experienced or imagined, this is good news. It means that the more we listen, the more we look, and the more we pay attention, the more that we will hear, see, and learn. Observation is the first action of a writer; the plasticity of our brain's neural networks means that the more we observe, the more we will perceive. Later in the book, we will delve far more deeply into the science, psychology, and practice of perception. Here, we will stay focused on how to recreate on the page those places where we play.

How do you spend your leisure time? What do you do when you aren't working, studying, or meeting your other daily obligations? Do you escape to a backcountry trail? Or to a seat high in the baseball bleachers? Let's consider how one place, the baseball field, can come alive on the page.

**The Ballpark**

What sights, sounds, smells, and emotions come to mind when you think of a baseball game? Even a place so commonplace and clichéd as the baseball diamond has great specificity in the hands of a skilled writer. In fact, the writer's challenge is to bring the specialness of a particular baseball game to the forefront. We will look at how three contemporary writers take us to the ballpark---and how a fourth invites us to a different kind of ballgame.

In his novel *Underworld*, Don DeLillo sets the scene in the stadium during the first nationally televised ballgame, when the New York Giants beat the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1951. In the book's prologue, Cotter Martin, a 14-year-old baseball fan, skips school to sneak into the stadium grandstand:

> He runs up a shadowed ramp and into a crossweave of girders and pillars and spilling light. He hears the crescendoing last chords of the national anthem and sees the great open horseshoe of the grandstand and that unfolding vision of the grass that always seems to mean he has stepped outside his life---the rubbed shine that sweeps and bends from the raked dirt of the infield out to the high green fences. It is the excitement of a revealed thing. He runs at quarter speed craning to see the rows of seats, looking for an inconspicuous wedge behind a pillar. He cuts into an aisle in section 35 and walks down into the heat and smell of the massed fans, he walks into the smoke that hangs from the underside of the second deck, he hears the talk, he enters the deep buzz, he hears the warm-up pitches crack into the catcher's mitt, a series of reports that carry a comet's tail of secondary sound.

Readers see, hear, and even smell the grandstand, the field, the crowd, and finally, the game. DeLillo keeps most of the attention on the grandstand, where Cotter Martin looks for a place to lurk "behind a pillar," since he's not paid for a ticket. A homerun hit by outfielder and third baseman Bobby Thomson during that 1951 game became known as "the shot heard 'round the world." DeLillo's metaphorical language recalls that bit of history, with the reference to a comet zooming through the sky.

B.H. Fairchild's poem "Body and Soul" invites us to a different kind of baseball diamond, in small-town Oklahoma in the mid-1940s:

> These were men's teams, grown men, some in their thirties\
> and forties who worked together in zinc mines or on oil rigs,\
> sweat and khaki and long beers after work, steel guitar music\
> whanging in their ears, little white rent houses to return to\
> where their wives complained about money and broken Kenmores

In this first stanza, we are firmly rooted in the workplaces, homes, and quotidian lives of these "grown men."

One night, a team is one man short, and they agree to let a 15-year-old teenager---known to none of them---join the game. The pitcher gives the teen "nothing fancy, just hard fastballs." The boy hits the third pitch "so quick and sure"

> that they pause a moment before turning around to watch\
> the ball still rising and finally dropping far beyond\
> the abandoned tractor that marks left field. Holy shit.

This is nothing like the ballfield that Giants fan Cotter Martin watches in 1951, though this Oklahoma game takes place only a half-dozen years earlier. Same time, wildly different place. The young batter in Fairchild's poem hits the next pitch "over the Allis Chalmers," a brand of tractor. Then, the teen---who turns out to be Mickey Mantle---decides to bat left-handed:

> He swings exactly the way he did right-handed\
> and they all turn like a chorus line toward deep right field\
> where the ball loses itself in sagebrush and the sad burnt\
> dust of dustbowl Oklahoma. It is something to see.

As readers, we watch the ball---and the men's sense of pride---disappear in the sagebrush of a small Oklahoma town where the Great Depression never really ended. In a poem about a ballgame, B.H. Fairchild has offered us a glimpse into richly imagined place and time.

Poet and essayist Martín Espada also takes us to the ballgame in his poem "Rain Delay: Toledo Mud Hens, July 8, 1994." Half a century after the teen-aged Mickey Mantle knocked it past the tractors, Espada conjures an audience only partly focused on the minor-league team they have come to watch. Like Fairchild's Oklahoma miners and oil-riggers, Espada's baseball fans are located in a land of financial worry. The poem begins:

> Despite the rumors of rain,\
> the crowd spreads across the grandstand,\
> a hand-sewn quilt, red and yellow shirts,\
> blue caps. The ballgame is the county fair\
> in a season of drought, the carnival\
> in a town of boarded factories,\
> so they sing the anthem as if ready\
> for the next foreign war.

The farm-worker audience, a "hand-sewn quilt," sees the team mascot, "a lightning bug called Louie" sponsored by the local electric company. While readers think about Midwestern summer evenings filled with fireflies, in the poem's "season of drought,"

> Men in Caterpillar tractor hats\
> rise from seats to yell at Louie\
> about their electric bills.

Here is the poem's final stanza:

> Ballpark lit in the iron-clouded storm,\
> a ghost dirigible floating overhead\
> and a hundred moons misting in the grey air.\
> A train howls in the cornfields.\
> When the water strikes down,\
> white uniforms retreat from the diamond,\
> but in the stands\
> farm boys with dripping hair\
> holler their hosannas to the rain.

Espada evokes a sense of rural place, as the train to somewhere else without stopping. These Ohio sports fans care more about their crops than about the white-uniformed Mud Hens, cheering for the drought-busting raindrops that pre-empt their game.

While we think of locations like the baseball diamond as "generic," they are generic only if we fail to make them specific when we recreate them. DeLillo's ballfield is unequivocally urban, with steel girders holding up the huge grandstand full of fans smoking cigarettes, the infield carefully raked, and a high fence surrounding it all. Fairchild's ballgame is informal, without even an official diamond, the outfields marked by farm machinery and encroaching wildlands. Espada tells us his "ballgame is the county fair," the biggest entertainment "in a town of boarded factories," a place that has fallen on hard economic times. In just a few words, each writer offers social and economic context.

The particular places we spend our leisure time are never generic to us. On the contrary, they are imbued with heartbreakingly specific detail. Think back to a childhood front yard or back porch, and what you experienced there. Early childhood memories of important play spots are often bright and crystalline in their specificity.

In her memoir *An American Childhood*, Annie Dillard takes us to a pick-up ballgame very different from the baseball games we just saw. In the Pittsburgh suburb of the early 1950s, she describes learning to play ball at age seven:

> Some boys taught me to play football. This was a fine sport... Your fate, and your team's score, depended on your concentration and courage. Nothing girls did could compare with it. Boys welcomed me to baseball, too, for I had, through enthusiastic practice, what was weirdly known as a boy's arm. In winter, in the snow, there was neither baseball nor football, so the boys and I threw snowballs at passing cars.

Dillard goes on to describe the setting of a kids-versus-cars snowball fight:

> It was cloudy but cold. The cars' tires laid behind them on the snowy street a complex trail of beige chunks like crenellated castle walls. I had stepped on some earlier; they squeaked. We could have wished for more traffic. When a car came, we all popped it one. In the intervals between cars we reverted to the natural solitude of children.

Dillard brings in temperature, color, texture, sound, an architectural simile, and a bit of action to set the street scene of the snowball fight. As with DeLillo, Fairchild, and Espada, we can see the results of Dillard's long practice with observation. Even when relating a long-ago event, she draws on a wide range of sensory detail to draw a full picture of place.

This ability to notice and reproduce detail is a special skill of writers---one that we share with several other vocations. Visual psychologist Laura Sewall explains:

> Well-honed attention---as evidenced by \[wildlife\] trackers, mindfulness practitioners, athletes, hunters, artists, writers, ornithologists, and more---is something quite different. It can be focused narrowly or distributed across the entire visual field at will. Its focus can be internal (on the contents of mind) or external, and it can be sustained for long periods. It is penetrating, quick, and efficient, picking up signals that are all together unseen by the untrained eye.

If this depth of attention seem daunting, it's important to remember that Sewall is describing something that a person develops over many years of practice. That's the good news: innate talent is not necessary. On that note, let's practice.

**Exercise: Exploring a Place to Play**

This is an experiential exercise---you need to go directly to the action. Visit a place where people spend their leisure time: a backyard, a city park, a ballfield. Go when you have at least an hour to spend: watching, listening, perceiving and writing. Following the suggested writing prompts below will fill your hour.

First, walk around the area for at least ten minutes, not writing anything, just noticing the sights, sounds, smells, patterns and voices in the space. Once you have explored the immediate area on foot, find a good spot to sit and take notes. Choose a vantage point that offers you a view of whatever activity is happening, but also allows you to work without interruption.

Next, make a list of the words that come to mind as you sit in this place. No need for sentences or a narrative line, just write down all the words that come to mind. Do this for several minutes. Try for words that are as *specific* and *precise* as possible.

On a new page (in your journal, or on your screen), list the letters of the alphabet down the left hand side of the page. All 26 of them. Next, try to think of a word related to something that you see, hear, perceive or feel in this place, beginning with each of the letters. You might be able to think of ten for the letter S and none for X, but that's OK. The idea is to use the alphabet to deepen your observation and to use different words (than you already have) to express your observation in language. Devote at least ten minutes to this exercise.

Now, it's time to do what poet and performer Anastacia Tolbert calls "ear hustling." For the next ten minutes, write down everything that you hear: sounds that are nearby and far away, disruptive noise, bits of overheard conversation, anything that drifts to your ears. It might help to close your eyes for a few seconds, mentally record what you hear, and then open your eyes---focusing only on your notebook---and write it all down.

After those ten minutes of listening, move on to other sensory input. For the next five minutes, describe the space visually. What do you see? Answer that question both literally and figuratively: What is here? And what does it remind you of? Allow yourself to move from actual description to metaphorical impression.

Next, ask yourself: What **smells or other physical sensations** do you perceive? (This might be harder to answer, closing your eyes and really concentrating can help.) Devote about five minutes to this step.

Next question: What is the **weather** and **quality of light and air** that surround you? Describe them in as much detail as you can. Spend three to five minutes doing so.

Next, look around and listen for at least a minute without writing anything. Ask yourself: what is the emotional tenor of this place, in this moment? Write about it for three to five minutes.

Finally, return to the alphabetized word lists you created when you first sat down. Choose ten or twelve words that feel particularly rich in specificity of meaning, or that especially evoke this place. Write for ten minutes, using those words as a jumping-off point.

**Chapter 9: From the Senses**

> "Making reality real is art's responsibility. It is a practical assignment, then, a self-assignment: to achieve, by a cultivated sensitivity for observing life, a capacity for receiving its impressions, a lonely, unremitting, unaided, unaidable vision, and transferring this vision without distortion..."
>
> \~ Eudora Welty, "Place in Fiction," 1951

Our direct experience of the world, of every particular *place* in the world, comes to us through our senses, through our human bodies interacting with the physical world. Writers are often given the advice to "use sensory detail" in their writing; place-based writing is particularly enriched by the use of such detail. We tend to focus on visual detail in our descriptions. Many writers need to be reminded to augment their literary settings with auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile elements.

Like so many of the tools that we apply to our writing, "the five senses" is a system of categorization that stretches back to Aristotle. In his work *Sense and Sensibilia*, he listed four human sensory systems: sight, hearing, smell, and touch. He considered taste to be a subset of touch. A generation earlier, Socrates considered humans to have a wider range of sensory systems, which (according to Plato) he listed as: hearing, sight, smell, and the senses of temperature, pleasure, pain, desire, and fear. As we understand it today, nearly 2,500 years later, Socrates was closer to correct than Aristotle was. We continue to talk about "the five senses," but scientists now understand human sensory systems to be far more complicated than that.

Before we delve into this complexity, I suggest that you try a writing exercise, to begin thinking about the importance of sensory experience in place-based writing.

**Suggested Exercise**: Find an image that represents a place that is important to you. It might be a photo of a beloved vacation destination, a postcard from a favorite hang-out, or a drawing of a home that was difficult for you live in for some reason. Place the image in front of you and go through the writing prompts below, devoting at least five minutes to each step.

1)  Describe the important visual details of this place, for someone who has never seen anything like it. Be specific.

2)  What is the soundscape of this place? When you think of it, what do you hear in your head?

3)  What does this place smell like? In general? At different times of day? In different seasons?

4)  What kind of physical movement (of your body) do you associate with this space? Is this movement pleasurable? Arduous? Painful?

5)  When this place causes pain, exactly how does that pain feel?

6)  What other bodily sensations does this place invoke? Describe them in as much detail as you can. You might try doing a "body scan," from the crown of your head to your soles of your feet, considering the physical sensations you experience in this place.

Now, let's take a look at how several authors have used the familiar "five senses" to anchor their poems, essays, and stories in place. Written descriptions tend to rely heavily on the visual, but master writers focus on the visual only when it serves some other purpose in the writing. In *The Devil's Highway*, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction, Luis Alberto Urrea introduces us to U.S. Border Patrol agents, "signcutters," who search for signs of undocumented migrants walking north across the Sonoran desert into Arizona. Urrea explains:

> Cutters read the land like a text. They search the manuscript of the ground for irregularities in its narration....They are land grammarians, got the PhD in reading dirt. On lava, a displaced stone will reveal a semicircle of light or ground underneath, likewise a pebble kicked out of place on the hardpan with the desert varnish that accumulates on the ground reveals a crescent of paler sand.

A few paragraphs later, Urrea explains precisely how the cutters "read the land," demonstrating the tiny visual cues on the desert floor that carry meaning:

> Signcutters know most walkers pass between 11:00 at night and 3:00 the next morning. They can tell how old a track is by its sharpness---even in the desert, dirt holds some humidity and it is this humidity that defines the track's edges. As a track ages, it dries, and as it dries, its edges soften. Bug-sign is created when small creatures begin to scurry about just before dawn. Often, this hour is the only comfortable moment of the day, and in a burst of breakfast exuberance, lizards, rats, and insects set off in a willy-nilly marathon.
>
> If bug-sign crosses over a walker's footprint, the cutter knows the walker has passed nearer to midnight than to dawn. If, however, the footstep flattens the bug-sign, the cutter knows the walker has recently passed, and is in the immediate area, and is probably in trouble. The sun is up, the temperature is rising, and the day will only get more brutal."

Urrea pulls readers down eye-level with the desert sand, showing them how to read the land "like a text." Seventy years earlier, legendary British journalist and author George Orwell used a similar tight focus in *The Road to Wigan Pier*, to expose the grim living conditions of workers in England's industrial north. In the book's first chapter, he takes readers into the rooming house where he lived:

> I never discovered how many bedrooms the house contained, but strange to say there was a bathroom, dating from before the Brookers' time. Downstairs there was the usual kitchen living-room with its huge open range burning night and day. It was lighted only by a skylight, for on one side of it was the shop and on the other the larder, which opened into some dark subterranean place where the tripe was stored. ... In front of the fire there was almost always a line of damp washing, and in the middle of the room was the big kitchen table at which the family and all the lodgers ate. I never saw this table completely uncovered, but I saw its various wrappings at different times. At the bottom there was a layer of old newspaper stained by Worcester Sauce; above that a sheet of sticky white oil-cloth; above that a green serge cloth; above that a coarse linen cloth, never changed and seldom taken off. Generally the crumbs from breakfast were still on the table at supper. I used to get to know individual crumbs by sight and watch their progress up and down the table from day to day.

In this passage, Orwell's excellent "camera work" guides readers' attention from the overall layout of the house to one room, then a single piece of furniture, and finally to the movement of crumbs on the tablecloth. He invokes the senses of touch and even taste, with the "sticky" and "course" table cloths, the dribbles of Worcester Sauce, and the personified crumbs surviving from one dinner to another.

Later in *The Devil's Highway*, Urrea employs both scent and sound (real and imagined) to demonstrate to readers the desert's deadliness. At this point in the story, several of the migrant "walkers" have become lost; most will lose their lives to exposure as they wander through the hottest hours of the day. Urrea interviewed those who survived---and the Border Patrol agents who found and the medical professionals who saved them---to piece together the story. The scene begins: "The group started to break apart as the demons and angels started to sing. They could smell their own stench. It was embarrassing. It was frightening." Later in the same scene, as the men's bodies begin to succumb to exposure and thirst:

> A voice was heard in the light-shatter, saying, "He's going to die. Lay him down here and let him die. Keep walking."
>
> The desert, out of focus and suddenly terribly sharp, burst white and yellow in their eyes. It tilted. Elongated. It was at an impossible angle! It tipped up toward the sun, and if they didn't crawl, they would slide right off it and fall forever. It made noise: THERE WERE ENGINES BENEATH THE DESERT. It made evil grinding noises, mechanical humming. No, it was insectile, the screech of hunger and derision. The devils were under the rocks, spitting insults. ... Hundreds of footsteps. Crunch. Slide. Gasping: that was the sound. Gasping and sobbing and coughing and heartbeats. *Canta y no llores!* The ragged breathing of those walking beside them made the men cringe. Stop to piss: piss in cupped hands, lick every hot smear of it from your fingers.

The power of Orwell's and (especially) Urrea's words becomes clearer when we consider the complexity of our human sensory systems. For example, what we label "sense of touch" is actually several different neural sensory systems, one each for perceiving pressure, friction, itchiness, and internal or external temperature (thermoception). In *The Devil's Highway*, Urrea's representation of the migrant men succumbing to exposure hints at several other human sensory systems:

1)  **Sensory receptors** in the throat perceive swallowing, gagging, and vomiting. These receptors can be triggered by emotional stress, as when someone describes their throat closing out of anxiety or fear.

2)  **Proprioception** allows us to know where the various parts of our body are in space and relative to other body parts. When drivers suspected of being under the influence are asked to close their eyes and put a forefinger on their nose, their sense of proprioception is being tested.

3)  **Tension sensors** in our muscles allow the brain the ability to monitor muscle tension. Writers can convey much about the terrain they are describing by mentioning (or just hinting at) the tension or fatigue in the characters' muscles.

4)  **Nociception** is our sensory system for pain. In fact, the human body contains three distinct types of pain receptors: **cutaneous** (those in the skin), **somatic** (that monitor our bones and joints), and **visceral** (those that enervate our internal organs).

5)  We are able to maintain our sense of balance, change the direction or velocity or our body's movement, and sense gravity, thanks to **equilibrioception**. This sensory system is regulated by the beautifully named vestibular labyrinthine system. It functions by sensing the movement of tiny calcium carbonite crystals in the liquid-filled canals of the inner ear.

6)  The brain medulla receives messages from **chemoreceptors** that monitor blood-borne hormones and drugs, triggering the vomiting reflex when they sense something dangerous.

7)  The basal ganglia in the human midbrain manage **temporal perception**---the sense that time is passing.

Many neuroscientists and experimental psychologists believe the human sensory systems extend far beyond the dozen I have just mentioned, including neural systems to perceive hunger and thirst, detect magnetic fields, and monitor the body's internal functioning---such as blood pressure, blood oxygen levels, and lung inflation.

One of the most effective ways to convey details of a place to readers is to describe its particular impact on the body. In her essay "The Solace of Open Spaces," author Gretel Ehrlich uses subtle sensory detail to emphasize Wyoming's brutal climate:

> Winter lasts six months here. Prevailing winds spill snowdrifts to the east, and new storms from the northwest replenish them. This white bulk is sometimes dizzying, even nauseating, to look at. At twenty, thirty, and forty degrees below zero, not only does your car not work, but neither do your mind and body. The landscape hardens into a dungeon of space. During the winter, while I was riding to find a new calf, my jeans froze to the saddle, and in the silence that such cold creates I felt like the first person on earth, or the last.

The focus is on the winter climate and the accumulating snowdrifts, but the narrator's physical experience is noted, as well. She is not only extremely cold, she is disoriented, sick to her stomach, confused, and terribly lonely. Place and character are inextricably entwined. As Eudora Welty puts it, "\[P\]lace has a good deal to do with making the characters real, that is, themselves, and keeping them so."

**Exercises: Using All Our Senses**

**Exercise #1:** Think of a place that has been extremely important to you, where you have spent a significant amount of time. Find a way to describe its impact on *each* of your sensory systems, working from the list below:

1)  **Sight**

2)  **Hearing**

3)  **Smell**

4)  **Taste (with separate receptors for sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami)**

5)  **Touch (pressure, friction, and itchiness)**

6)  **Thermoception (internal and external)**

7)  **Esophageal sensory reception**

8)  **Proprioception**

9)  **Muscle tension sensory reception**

10) **Nociception (cutaneous, somatic, and visceral)**

11) **Equilibrioception**

12) **Chemoreception**

13) **Temporal reception**

14) **Thirst and hunger sensation**

15) **Magnetoception**

**Exercise #2:** Think of a place you would like to write about. Now, think of a particular experience you have had (or a character *could* have, if you are writing fiction) in that place. Choose *three* human senses that capture that experience---trying to use at least *two* that are not "the big five" of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Write for at least fifteen minutes.

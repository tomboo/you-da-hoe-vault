Plotting Idaho

One idea is to plot the internal development arc for the main characters. James proceeds from frozen into thawing. Lilia, the sex addict, proceeds from cold clinical sex to warm hand holding and comfort. Old Girl goes from wanting to die to wanting to live.

Dr. Hazy whom they call Lazy & Crazy, wants to \_\_\_\_ rural idea and crazy fucked-up kids so he goes from \_\_\_\_\_ to free.

What does the Garbage man want? He\'s out in the dirt and cold alone; he wants to e close and warm even though he has no way to appropriately get it. He sees the daughter of the two girls in their room and it\'s like a song he\'s never heard \_\_\_\_\_ and exerting a pull. He leaves stuff he finds interesting as little gifts of his friendship like a small child. He wants connection but he\'s frozen out.

In [When Will There Be Good News]{.underline}, Atkinson plots her story using characters who all circle around a crime. Each character is revealed in their own fucked up lives and the events that drive them to solve the crime connect them.

Is there an equivalent in my story. The crime solving drives what\'s next.

Look at it from the POV of connection: Graham\'s impending death drives One Good Turn; Graham\'s shoddy building practices impact Louise who has bought one of his shitty homes; Martin runs into the baseball wielding \_\_\_\_\_ of Graham at the beginning and the real killer, whom Gloria has hired, fades \_\_\_\_ from the crowd.

Maybe the key is to find the character or event they\'re all orbiting around? It feels like tension with be a better driver \-- not convinced this is a lyrical, all \_\_\_\_\_ story. I like stories driven by what\'s next and that have an internal tension that presses the reader forward.

It could be something with the gargabe man. The kids think of themselves as so much garbage. They\'re thrown away along with the key while their friends, parents, families, even their despised high school teachers, live free outside the walls. The garbage man lives outside society and he wants to breath in and rape the girls and club the boys and torch the place.

Maybe he\'s the source of the fire in one wing?

So, two types of conflicts: external and internal.

Garbage man wants to break in and pillage.

Dr. Lazy & Crazy wants to escape \_\_\_\_\_ Idaho and move to Hawaii.

What are Garbage Man\'s escalating actions?

Garbage man starts out circling Healing House and watching and observing. He\'s visible but nobody really sees him.

He leers at Rachel or Old Girl in underpants and tee shirt when she runs out to dump her pills she hasn\'t been taking. Makes her feel uncomfortable.

He leaves a maggoty crow on James\' pillow.

He can\'t leave a pasted together collage of people parts put on the wrong way that simulates having doggy sex.

He could build a crazy creature of doll parts and crab claws that he leaves on Rachel\'s bed.

He moves things around in people\'s rooms with his claw in the night and it gives people the creeps.

At first, his forays into Healing House are multi-directional, anyone and everyone is an object of fascination.

Later in the story, Rachel becomes the one he has his eye on and he becomes infatuated when she says hello.

Maybe the dolls he makes from the parts are surrogates for Garbage Man\'s twisted idea of love. He gives her a doll with her face pasted on it. His representation has one eye on a huge man\'s penis and a mechanical heart. Look at Chris Griffin\'s creatures for inspiration.

Maybe he has a messed up baby who\'s the product of the union in his own heart. Old Girls find on the truck seat next to him.

Maybe it\'s just a box of stolen baby doll parts he intends as a gift. He doesn\'t have to do anything \-- he can\'t \_\_\_\_ the terror in crazy behavior.

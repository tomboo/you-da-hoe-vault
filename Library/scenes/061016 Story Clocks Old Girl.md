Old Girl opening

Every resident has a time line but what they don't tell you about the Program is that the clocks run backwards and forwards with the result that you are stuck in one moment of endless forever.

Old Girl's clock had started two years ago. She made the mistake of thinking she was moving forward in ordinary time at the beginning of her stay. What she didn't realize was that her clock also ran backward based on every infraction she committed. Fight with your roommate? Automatic extension of your stay for another month. Hurt yourself on purpose Three months in Stabilization, then another two months before you could start again at Square One. Go into a depressive funk and stop talking or smiling and eating, you get the picture of clock with its innards sprung.

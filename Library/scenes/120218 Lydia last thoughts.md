120218 Lydia last thoughts

Lydia was used to being in charge of her body. It had never betrayed her like Rachel's body when it slipped from her conscious control. She did not know yet that the body made its own decisions, divorced from what went on in the mind. But she would.

When Lydia's body would go no further, even though her mind was telling her to walk on, she swayed at the lip of the road. It seemed as if the snowy path had darkened. The moonlight had dimmed as if the road which had started out as bright as a highway, now fell to darkness on both sides. The road forward became only a pin prick of light like the stars winking out in the darkness above.

Maybe a deer, an elk, some warm bodied ungulate like a moose, had sheltered in the well overnight. She felt drawn to the heat of its body. It was dark in the shelter of the pine but could it be warm away from the frozen road?

In the well, she let herself sink to her knees. Her side rested against the caramel smelling tree bark. She would just rest there a moment. Catch some warm from the just departed creature who had left its winter den.

In a short while, her eyelids dipping down and then semi-widening awake, that she became a woodland creature as she let her body settle onto its side. And in time she wasn't a creature as sleep pressed its coffin lid over her, but a glacier lily that was dreaming of pushing its head above the ice crystals now embedded in her cheek. She was a white flower, then a yellow bloom, flaming bright against the pinpricked sky that could be sensed but not seen overhead. In the spring, she would rise out of this restful sleep and brighten the wilderness within a field of beauty.

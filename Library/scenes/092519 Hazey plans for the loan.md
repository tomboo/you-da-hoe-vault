092519 Hazey plans for the loan

Hazey had a plan for expanding Inner Horizons.

"I can't go to the bank like this," he said.

Margaret's eyebrows rose up like antennas. "The bank? What are you meeting about?"

"Outer Mongolia," he said, absently.

"What?"

"A little joke," he said. "We have to expand beyond Podunk Idaho. People on the East Coast think this is Outer Mongolia."

"Isn't Mongolia somewhere in the Far East? Like the Himalayas?"

"So is Shangrila," said the doctor, gnomically. "Now what about those shoes."

"I think they wear sandals."

"The Mongols wear felt. I'm talking about my shoes. The black ones that go with this suit."

"I can't go to the bank like this."

"Why not?"

"With one brown shoe and one black one? They'll think I'm nuts."

Well, you are, was Margaret's first thought. "You could go home and change if it's that important."

"Lydia's mother will be here at 10."

"Keep your feet under the desk and she won't notice."

"The loan officer is taking me to lunch. Plenty of time for you to go get my shoe and bring it to me."

Margaret opened her mouth to protest but Hazey was still talking. "We need to make a good impression on the bankers."

We? White man? It was the first time Dr. Hazey had included Margaret in any of his plans. Did that mean he was starting to recognize her for her contributions?

"Is there trouble with the finances?"

"Oh, no." Hazey pushed that thought away like a bad smell. "I'm getting a loan because we're out of room."

Boy, howdy. The Program had doubled kids in rooms that used to be singles. All the doubles were triples. I All the kids were crabbing about roommates they couldn't stand. If anybody mentioned bunkbeds, there would be a revolt.

"I thought the loan was on hold until the Certification Board came back with its ruling."

"Oh, that." Hazy waved his hand like a scepter. "My lawyer came up with a nifty solution."

"Oh?"

"I made a donation to Dr. Evensong's research. Easy-peasy."

Easy-peasy if you have money coming out of your ears.

"Squeaky wheel gets the grease,"Hazey said.

It wasn't clear to Margaret whether Dr. Evenson was the grease or the squeaking wheel. She had tried to fix Healing House's raccoon problem in advance of the Certification Review Board's visit but unfortunately, they showed up early in the day when she was shooting at them. Holy mother of graham crackers!. Was that why Hazey had called her into his office? Not because Gretchen had ratted on her?

Margaret was well aware that the Review Board visit two weeks earlier had not gone well. She held her breath now, hoping that Hazey hadn't called her in to fire her for her part in that fiasco. Was it her fault the Review Board didn't understand that the time change between Seattle and Couer d'Alene.

Margaret's heart sank. Is that why Dr. Hazey had called her in to the inner sanctum? Was he going to fire her for shooting at the raccoons? How was she supposed to know that the Review Board would show up an hour early because they didn't understand the difference between Pacific Time and Mountain Time in Couer d'Alene.

"How big is this loan?" she asked idly.

"Big enough to expand Inner Horizons by 50%," Hazey said.

"I thought the Certification Review Board\--." Margaret stopped herself. That was slippery ground that she didn't want to tread.

"What about the Certification Review?"

"I thought we were in hot water with Dr. Evensong. You know, after the concussion."

"Served the old busy body right for wearing new shoes instead of boots. Besides, I made a donation to his stupid research."

"Is he out of the hospital?" Dr. Evenson had slipped on the ice under the snow on Healing House's driveway. Margaret could still hear the thunk like the crack of a melon.

"He's well enough to count a lot of zeros," Hazey said with some asperity.

Margaret saw her opportunity and slammed the door on the racoon danger zone. "I know, Dr. Hazey. I'll go get your shoe for you."

"Well, he did get a concussion," she said.

"Too bad you didn't shoot him too," Hazey said. "Who would wear new shoes in the snow?"

"I'd be happy to go pick up your shoes," Margaret said smoothly, steering the conversation away from any more discussion of raccoons and the rifle she brought in from home.

"I thought the Review Board had to approve the expansion."

"They do. I just didn't say anything about their visit to the bank yet."

"Maybe the Board will approve us anyway," Margaret tried to brighten the gloom-and-doom in the room. "It wasn't our fault they showed up at a bad time.

"When you bring a gun on the premises with mentally unstable adolescents is there such a thing as a good time?" Hazey wanted to know.

"I can't go to the bank like this," he said. "They'll think I'm crazy."

She nodded, agreeing that he was crazy, but at the same time shaking her inner head at the fact that ordinary people avoided seeing what was right in their face.

"What's the meeting about?"

"I'm just going to reassure them that everything is on track."\
"Is it?" She wanted to ask about the Certification Review Board's decision but was afraid to bring up a sore subject, especially since she herself was the reason for it.

"They haven't voted on certification yet. Dr. Evenson is still on medical leave for his concussion." A concussion that was Margaret's fault, Hazey seemed to imply, though it was through no fault of her own. Hazey was the one who told her to clean up those raccoons.

Hazey had a crafty glint in his eye. "I'm going to get the bank's approval for this." He pulled out a green check from a folder on his desk and held it up.

Margaret blanched at the amount of zeroes that trailed off behind the dollar sign like a row of amazed eyeballs.

"What's that for?"

"It's a donation to Evensong's research." He leaned back in his chair. "Think the bank'll go for it?"

Marget was personally impressed by any amount with more than three zeroes. She had no experience with five zeros and above. "Isn't it the bank's money?"

"No, it's mine. I just have to pay it back from future earnings." He smiled beatifically. "Plus I can write off the donation as a business expense. Cost of doing business."

"It's a lot of money."

"Your problem is that you don't know how the world works, Margaret."

"Oh?"

"Aren't you familiar with greasing the skids? Payola? You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours?" Hazey was studying his mis-matched shoes. "Speaking of, would you go get my shoes?"

"That isn't in my job description."

"Neither is payola, but it still exists."

Those fucking raccoons. They had a lot to answer for."

"Is it payola if it isn't in my job description?"\
No, he said. That's "do it because I said so."

Well OK then, Margaret thought when she got behind the wheel of his new gold Lexus.

"Did you hear from the Review Board?"

"Not yet." Hazey's expression changed from doom and gloom to the craft look of a fat fox. "I think this'll help."

"What?"\
He plucked a check from a folder on his desk. The number of zeroes on the back end of the amount made her own eyes spin.

"Wow. Can we afford that?"\
"We can if the bank approves the loan," he said. "That's why this meeting is so important."

"To get their approval?"

"No, to force them to cover it. It's already in the mail."

Margaret eyes were bigger than all those zeros combined. She'd never written a check she couldn't cover in her life.

"Shut your mouth. A fly could get in," Hazey said. "Your problem is that you have no idea how the world works. Haven't you ever heard of pay-ola? You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours?"

"So the check is good?"

"Oh, hell, no. I'm just applying a little leverage."

If that's leverage, what's extortion? Margaret thought, when it also occurred to her that either one of them paid pretty well.

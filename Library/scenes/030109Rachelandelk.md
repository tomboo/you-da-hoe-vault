030209 Rachel and elk

Rachel

Rachel heard it before she saw it. A sound like distant breaking glass. Then thrashing and gnashing accompanied by jagged hoarse snorts like a horse in distress. Angela \-- she'd told Rachel to forget her name, the only name she answered to was Old Girl -- raced ahead, followed by James who was fleet as a deer, tailed by Rachel. A thunder crack. An odd whinnying that wasn't like any horse Rachel had ever heard in her junior riding days, got louder, more intense, as they ran.

By the time they reached the lake, the elk was already tiring. Rachel could see the cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged pool of out a hundred yards from shore. An elk floundered there, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. She would lunge part way up, heaving her massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break with her weight. Every time it seemed to get a purchase on the edge, another cliff of snow-covered ice would crack off like a whip. The black water was dotted with snow clumps and floating ice that shuddered and bobbed while the creature swam in circles.

"Holy shit," James voice was awestruck.

"How can we help?" Angela cried out like she'd seen struck. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight of the drowning creature, she registered the fracture of Angela's careful cooler-than-thou facade. *So she has a heart* flitted through her mind while the elk made another lunge. It had huge antlers and starting eyes that rolled in terror as it circled in the freezing water.

"Don't go out there. You'll fall in." James voice was matter-of-fact, as if he'd already accepted the inevitable.

Angela wasn't having any of that crap. "We need a stick!" She started yanking at a clump of downed aspen partially submerged at the lake's edge. She got her hands on a stout branch and was using her bodyweight, trying to break it off at the trunk.

"What's it going to hold on with?" James was looking at Angela as if she were nuts. "Don't even think about going out there!"

"Maybe we can lever it up. Just enough to help it onto the thicker ice. " Angela addressed Rachel like a drill sergeant. Rachel grabbed on to the branch with Angela and with them both jumping near the joint, it finally began to splinter and crack.

Rachel had the ice-laden branch in her bare hands when the elk made a final shuddering heave. It fell helplessly back, and then, as they gazed in amazement, it seemed to give up. For a few unearthly seconds, as its head and body sank, Rachel saw the candelabra points of the antlers floating as if suspended by unseen strings above the black surface. When the antlers finally slipped soundlessly under water, the only sign that the elk had been there were a few slowing whorls in the jagged hole. The rest of the group caught up to them, led by a pissed off Josh. What & hell were you thinking. You're supposed to stay with the group." Jose issued his second warning of the day on James, and he said Angele and Rachel we both getting ones for poor peer interactions and rule infractions. Rachel was still fuzzy about Inner Horizons arcane system of "consequences," which involved numbers from one to three for everything from household chores to therapeutic learning. Angela didn't seem upset, and James was also unfazed.

Rachel was about to tell the group about the drowning elk when Angela shoved her snowshoe into Rachel\'s boot. *What the\--?* James was also giving her the stink eye, so Rachel took the hint and clamped her mouth shut, "Jesus, watch where you're going," Rachel said to Angela, pulling her snowshoe out from her weight..

Josh, who apparently thought of himself as Mr. Wilderness, pointed out the jagged hole. "Look. Something fell through the ice out there."

Everybody, except Rachel, Angela and James, had an idea for what fell through. Reza said it was a bear. "Look how big it is."

An acne-inflicted kid Rachel hadn't met, contradicted him. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else thought may be a moose. "Look at the tracks."

A few light snowflakes began to drift sideways. That ended the argument. Josh called for an about face so they could hightail it back to the Suburban before the snow got serious. Josh, a native Idahoan, had some weird local expressions. On the car ride up to the trail head, he'd yelled back at one of the kids to shut his pie hole. Not a phrase common to the New York bedroom community in Connecticut where Rachel had from up, before her parents were killed in a fire.

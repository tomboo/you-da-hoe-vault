Old Girl doesn\'t watch the vehicle hurtling toward her. She doesn't want to witness gravity and tons of metal speeding at her to crush her into a bloody spot. Why look at ugliness? Her mom used to say, It\'s a beautiful world. Why shouldn\'t Old Girl\'s last view of life on earth be of something beautiful?

That\'s why she\'s staring at the Ponderosa pines that line the winding road. The road curves sharply before the dip in which she's lying and she can see the anxious hop and flutter of the car's headlamps in the trees. The lights catch caramel colored bark, lighting one after another bole reaching for the stars and she\'s thinking about the smell of caramel mixed with vanilla when you peel the puzzle shaped pieces of bark off the tree. Why does it smell sweet? She\'s thinking, expecting oblivion to answer.

A terrific bang. Hailstorm of falling snow and ice. Bark, branches, wood splinters, chips pelt her in the face and neck like someone has hurled a shovel-full of sharp gravel at her.

Old Girl is on her feet and scrambling up the high berm of snow on the roadside before she even realizes she is moving. Her feet are numb and she\'s wobbly and uncoordinated, falling and slipping on the icy bank toward a heap of crumpled metal with still spinning wheels.

The engine rumbles. High beams light the tree tops at a crazed angle. A big ancient truck has hit one of the tallest pines head on and the front end is embedded in a trunk bent backwards from the crash.

She clambers up the snow berm pushed far above her head by the snow plows and she manages to half-slip, half-slither down the back side of the berm to the passenger side door. The truck has hit a gigantic Ponderosa Pine dead center. All she can see inside is a dark hunched form leaning forward with arms protectively hugging the steering wheel. No luck yanking the bent door open. The glass on the windshield is crazed but still holding together. She crawls up on the crumpled hood and starts kicking at the broken glass using the blunt toes of her packs to break out the shards clinging to the rubber molding like jagged icicles.

"Are you hurt?" she calls through the hole she's enlarging with her feet but all she can hears is the breathy rumble of a rough-running engine. She smells gas and some unidentifiable stink. It takes a lot of work to kick a hole in the glass big enough to let her get inside and she brushes at the glass shards with her gloves trying to clear an entrance. Finally she just backs into the jagged hole using her heels to kick aside the shards. A gymnastic eel turn and shimmy deposits her in the front seat next to the driver which has become a weirdly narrow space between the dashboard and the rear of the cab. Litter covers everything. A tangle of ropes. Hamburger wrappers. Paper cups. Orange peels A roll of duct tape. Something metal.

It takes her a minute to understand why the space is so cramped. The engine normally under the hood has driven itself forward into the cab and the steering column is resting in the chest of the driver. The man isn't hugging the steering wheel. He\'s leaning forward and his arms are wrapped around the column because it\'s embedded in his chest.

\"Holy shit,\" Breathing in, she's assaulted by the wet penny smell of blood. To her astonishment, the driver opens his eyes and he turns his face towards her He\'s looking at her with the expression of someone who has something he doesn\'t and she has no idea what that might be.

\"Are you hurt?\" she says again. The absurdity of the question\--for Christ\'s sake the steering column is sticking into his chest!---propels her into reaching for the ignition key and she turns the engine off.

A dark, almost black stickiness wets her fingers. It\'s coming from the steering wheel. Engine fluid? Lubricant? The head lights stare crazily up at snow capped branches. Enough light is reflected into the cab to reveal the pallor of the man\'s face. Black greasy hair frames a puzzled expression.

\"Who are you? he wants to know.

For the first time in all her years in treatment, Old Girl says, \"Hope. My name is Hope." What's the point of going into the chapter and verse about how she got the name Old Girl when it seems beyond the point?

"Pretty," he says, his voice raspy and faint.

The man is filthy. He\'s grizzled and his hair is dark and stiff. He's got a gash next to his temple that is dripping red. He waves his hand vaguely at the steering column. \"It\'s stuck,\" he says. "Can't move.\"

It dawns on Old Girl then that the dark flow that is dripping quietly on the floor mat is coming from the man's chest. "I should go and get help." She wants desperately to scramble out of the truck, but he holds his hand out, dark and wet, and he grasps hold of her fingers. \"I\'m scared," he whines. For a man who has a steering column embedded in his chest he\'s got the grip of Hercules and she's never seen an expression of such intense longing. "Stay," he says. "Don't leave me."

\"Don't close your eyes." Old Girl is thinking about something she read about not allowing a person with a concussion to fall asleep, a useless fact that\'s stuck like a lot of other useless information in her head. He nose is bleeding and she tries not to count the black beads that are flowing down the steering column. The drips are falling like an irrigation hose on high.

\"I didn\'t do nothing," he murmurs at one point. Later, he says, "Unfair."

Old Girl nods, in complete agreement. Life isn\'t fair. She doesn't have a steering column sticking out of her chest, for example. She is the one who laid down in the road expecting death to find her and instead, it found this dirty, stinking man.

\"What are you going to do about it?" He says philosophically.

"Shhhh." Old Girl squeezes his hand, then tries to count his thready pulse. Is it multiply by 6 for 10 seconds or is it count the beats for 10 seconds and divide by 6? She gives up because even an idiot can tell that his pulse is gaining speed like a train pulling out of the station. She\'s watching the drops that are dripping from the column like the ticks of a slowing clock to the floor. \"Who knew that he hath so much blood in him,\" the line from Macbeth comes to her. Now she wishes she\'d paid more attention in Elizabethan Lit and especially in First Aid and Home Accident Prevention, the class she took to become a certified baby sitter. Now she\'s not sure that even if she had paid attention in babysitting that the instructions would have covered a dying man holding her hand with a death grip. About the time it occurs to her it is a death grip, she perceives a relaxation of his fingers as if he\'s drifting off to sleep.

The last thing he says to her, after brushing restlessly at his chest, is, "Always rain. Never any goddamned sun."

The tick of the engine. A drip like a leaky faucet. A rasp, dry and dull as wheat chaff, exits from his lungs.

Something feels enormous. Ever after she will remember this moment but have no idea why except that she feels she\'s in the presence of death. The only time that will come close to this feeling in her later life will be the birth of a baby that is so far from conception at this point it might as well be one of the stars scattered like diamond dust across the sky. Before, in his fear and terror, she had been feeling like the man \-- grubby, dirt-encrusted, smelling vaguely of hamburger grease and motor oil \-- was holding on to her as if to life itself. As his breathing started to change from an even breathy rasp to deep in inhalations with long silences between \-- she realizes she is the one gripping him.

If she had all the power in the world, she\'d keep him in the cab, among the burger wrappings and old styrofoam coffee cups, the ripped seat with the guts of it spilling out.

His eyes are closed. His color, when she got in the cab, was ruddy with life, and now his lips have whitened and he\'s a dusky blue on the tip of his nose. The black stubble of his beard looks blacker, more light resistant in contrast to his whitening skin.

When the silence between his gasps get longer, she knows he\'s going. Four... five... on the sixth slow rasping breaths, the silence elongates. His jaw opens and closes like a fish without water over its gills. A light gust of wind riffles the papers on the dash. Goose bumps pass over his neck and chest, then his face turns dusky, gray and dim as salted snow.

For all her longing for death since she was nine or ten years old, she\'s never seen it. In the moment of recognition that the light in his flinty eyes has switched off, she holds tight to his hand, willing the warmth of her own blood and life into the man's cooling fingers. A sudden vast longing to turn the hands of the clock back to the moment when his eyes still gleamed fills her.

It is easier this time to back out of the cab feet first, reversing her direction from the way she came in, as if she\'s squirming out of a birth canal. She kick-steps a trail up the tall plowed berm and makes her way back to the road toward town feeling new blood pulsing in her feet, the pain like ice crystals tumbling and tearing her veins.

The silver snow light seems colder. A few snow flakes sift down from pine branches bent over by the crash.

A strange half human-half crab monster doll she found on the floor of the cab nestles in her pack. It has a shaving brush for a head with large goggly eyes mounted to the handle that bounce on metal springs. A unicorn-sharp shell for a penis. Its arms are mismatched doll parts, one brown, the other pink. It's bottom half, naked as a newborn, has claws instead of legs.

Her plan is to walk into town and thumb a ride to I-90, then hitch to Seattle, where she intends to ask her aunt and uncle to help her get on her feet.

She's wanted to die for so long, it is hard to imagine a life directed at living. Instead of blowing her nose and wishing she could blow her brains out, she now has to think about reaching for a Kleenex. Life was complicated when all she was thinking about was getting rid of past nasal drip. Maybe the truck driver who picked her up would have one of those pocket packets of tissues. Or possibly a box between the seats. A whole world of possibilities opened up when you were thinking about how to live your life. Maybe she should just stop by a 7 Eleven and grab some napkins.

In the meantime, she begins to trudge along, feeling life, painful and biting, reawakening her frozen toes.9

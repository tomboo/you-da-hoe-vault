Esty Responds to Bullying: Old Girl POV

Cynthia Hartwig

Late afternoon or what her mom used to call Cyanide Hour.

For most of the afternoon stupid cow Esty had been sitting on the plaid couch like a lump of blubber and just taking the group's jabs like a beaten creature. Did Reza and Danny torture her just to see if they could get a rise out of her? Or was it some kind of need to get a reaction to prove they were strong and Esty was weak?

"Esty, you've got a lard ass." Danny said from her queenly perch on the only wingback chair in the living area. "Don't you ever look at yourself in the mirror?"

Danny had had a double all to herself for two weeks while Esty was at Stable being drugged to the teeth on whatever antipsychotics they were giving her to calm her. You'd think Danny would have been thankful. Unless the little bitch was trying to engineer another blow up?

"Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?" Reza, the ex-meth addict, who was small and wiry as a ferret, seized the floor. "A smart ass!"

Picking on Esty was like punching a bowl of Jello. Fat, blobby Esty just absorbed the blows and shook. She didn't fight back. Wasn't quick enough to make snappy comebacks. Never defended herself. An hour ago, she'd been zoned out and zombified, so far deep within herself, she barely registered anything they dished out.

Old Girl wasn't positive but she thought it was possible that Esty might be waking up. Her red-rimmed eyes had lost their vague haziness. Her foot jumped in her slippers. The pokes might be landing in Jello but they were starting to make her irritable like jello shots laced with too much tequila.

Right before Darlene called them in to dinner, Esty lumbered off to the bathroom. While she was gone, Reza and Paul started arm wrestling on the floor. One of them kicked over a glass of water on the end table next to the flowered couch. They ignored it, letting the spill soak into the cushions, not that the old couch would be worse for wear.

Esty came back and immediately sat on the wet spot and that made everybody whoop with laughter. Her face was blank as milk. No clue why everyone was hooting.

Jesus. Was Esty so slow she didn't feel her butt getting wet?

Reza, with a feral gleam in his eye, said, "You just went to the bathroom. How come you peed in your pants?"

Esty wrinkled a bovine forehead. "Did not."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

You could almost see the gears in Esty's drugged brain clanking toward the awareness of dampness on her pants. She stood up and turned her broad, cottage-cheesed ass to the group and tried to peer at herself over her shoulder as her hand groped at the dark and spreading stain.

A few days before, Old Girl had overheard Margaret tell Dr. Hazey that they needed to buy Reza a rubber sheet because he kept soaking the mattress. If Old Girl had been wetting her bed, she would have kept her mouth shut when somebody else couldn't control their bladder. Naturally, Reza did the opposite. Apparently, if you hated yourself for being weak, the second you got a chance to hurt someone even weaker, you piled on with both feet and then used your kidneys to piss on them. Did hurting someone else feel that much better than being hurt?

Soon, the whole group was in on it. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Piss and vinegar!" "R. Kelly and Etsy---PiSSSSS!!" Nobody came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit, Old Girl told herself for perhaps the millionth time.

Etsy threw Old Girl, a look of silent pleading that Old Girl ignored. She wanted to stab her for being so stupid. How could she be such a fucking victim. "No wonder Esty stinks," Old Girl called out. "She's piss poor at holding her water!"

Darlene finally called them into dinner shouting, "Meat loaf, yay! and it took Old Girl a few minutes to figure out their next little game.

Paul picked the seat across from Esty and Danny plopped down beside her while Reza took the chair on her other side. When the meatloaf dish was passed to Danny, she took a slice, then slid it across the table to Paul, who sent the dish down the opposite side of the table away from Esty. Reza speared a boiled potato and sent the serving dish the opposite direction. He repeated the action when the butter came to him, then the gray peas. The only food that landed near Esty was the undressed spinach salad with a lonely slice of hardboiled egg and two mushrooms (only therapists doled out dressing).

"Hey, Danny, " Esty eyed the nearly empty meat platter. "The meat loaf skipped me."

Danny made fakey, shock-eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Yes you did," Reza said like an oil sprocket. "Right after you refused the potatoes."

The only thing on Esty's plate was the lone dinner roll the Program allowed people on the "high energy/high protein" diet. Skinny Paul, on the high fat diet, was busy shoveling glops of butter onto Mt. Spudmore. "What?" Paul said, looking up. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't," said Etsy.

Darlene, sensing something brewing at the end of the table, interrupted her rant about black ice and called out, "Esty, how come you're not eating?"

Reza turned to Esty's plate and slopped a load of naked, wilting spinach on top of Esty's dinner roll. "Have some greens. It makes your shit smell sweet."

For a second, Old Girl thought Esty might bawl with frustration. She was grimacing at the spinach and when she picked up her fork, Old Girl thought she would flick the crap to the floor. Instead, Esty gripped the handle in her fist and drove the tines into the back of Reza's hand.

Reza screamed. He tried to bolt up from the table, but was stopped midway by Esty who threw her considerable bulk over his forearm and drove the fork deeper into the tabletop.

"Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated the babble. "Bitch!" "Esty, let go!" Stop! Stop!" A crazy, high-pitched laugh from Danny rolled on and on

while Darlene and Reza tried to dislodge Etsy's grip.

Old Girl, seated at the bottom of the table, watched the herky-jerking bodies like a movie reel. She chewed and then carefully swallowed a bland boiled potato. Dessert was definitely off the table, she thought. If Margaret had been on duty, she'd make sure they got popcorn later, but Darlene---fucking clueless Darlene---would have no idea how to feed the hungry.

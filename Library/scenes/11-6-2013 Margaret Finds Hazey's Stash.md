Margaret Finds Hazey\'s Stash

Through the cat door the smell of smoke wafted into the kitchen. Shit. Rusty\'s taking a smoke break. Margaret, on no impulse she could name except human curiosity \-- Pandora\'s box and all that \-- worked her way back through the antique furniture and china-stuffed cabinets and new overstuffed couches covered in white \-- white? That cans it. Hazey really is insane! She managed to stop herself from lying down and taking a nap. Lloyd\'s back had him twisting and resetting himself to find a position where he could relax and Margaret hadn\'t had the heart to leave him to his misery and sleep in the spare room. She shoved off the pull of the white couch. What if she had a grease spot on her butt? Then went back to the master bathroom to pee:

Marble counters. Gold faucets in double sinks. She played with a switch on the towel bar wondering what it was for. She abandoned it in the on position then idly opened the medicine cabinet. Holy fucking shit! Hazey\'s cabinet wasn\'t just a medicine cabinet; it was the whole of the drug cornucopia that Life Journeys stocked for the kids. Her first thought was Hazey must be dying. Is it HIV/AIDS? The man seemed to love women now that his crazy wife, Donna, had taken up semi-permanent residence at some fat farm in Mexico.

She read a label for a prescription for Klonopin. Another one for Atavan. Diazapam. (Look up a list: \_\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_). She read out the name April Hunt. The girl who\'d been a part of that \_\_\_\_ family richer than God and a kleptomaniac? She reached for another bottle; this one belonged to Reza Cohen. \_\_\_ milligrams a day of Ritalin. The poor kid could not help himself from jumping up at meals and practically \_\_\_\_ the halls to work off his terrible ADD. By the time she looked at most of the pills on the shelves, Margaret was up to 150 prescriptions of a psychotropic circus ride for kids who\'d left the program. the Ritalin prescription for Reza was dated in October and the kid had been gone since New Year\'s.

Dimly she registered the rumble of the dump truck leaving the driveway. But Margaret\'s brain was busy solving the conundrum of an enormous drug stash living in Dr. Hazey\'s bathroom for kids who were gone from the treatment program. Hazey was writing new prescriptions for whatever drug he wanted in the names of kids he\'d treated?

She lined up about 20 brown plastic bottles across the marble counter like obedient faceless soldiers. If the date of the prescription was 2013, she remembered every kid. Earlier dates, before she got hired, she had no idea who they were. But the records were available in Hazey\'s office. Margaret cleaned there every week and she knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the top right drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and anybody else who wanted to know the gory details.

She regretted taking the bottles of drugs for the kids she knew out of the crammed shelves. Fuck. What if Hazey, now officially incontrovertibly crazy in Margaret\'s mind, had an order to his drugs. They sure as hell weren\'t alphabetized but maybe he put his favorites on a \_\_\_\_\_\_ shelf. She randomly tucked the canisters in wherever she found space and shrugged. Nothing she could do about it if Hazey figured out she\'d spent an interesting half hour perusing his Pleasure Chest.

She was so distracted, she almost forgot the black wingtip she\'d been sent for. She\'d left it on the kitchen counter when Rusty Barrow sat on the front step and smoked his cigarette. She remembered the shoes when she was turning the SUV around in the circular driveway. So she left the car running and retraced her path to the kitchen for the damned shoe. A long curl of brown sausaged skin twisted on the step like a coiled snake. Rusty Barrow\'s calling card, along with the butt he\'d crushed in the pot of topiary rabbits.

Margaret has to decide what to do with the drug information.

The day after Margaret\'s interesting trip to Dr. Hazey\'s house, Grinchen and Margaret got into it again. The fight started with some sniping on Grinchen\'s part when she called Margaret away from vacuuming to set the dinner table.

Margaret said, \"Why don\'t we make the kids set the table? Seems like they\'re big enough to help around here.\"

\"Do you have any idea what their parents pay to park them here?\"

Margaret wasn\'t born yesterday. She assumed it was a lot but she\'d never stopped to figure it out.

\"It has nothing to do with our fees,\" she said. \"How the hell are they ever going to learn responsibility if they never have to work?\" About eight of them were lounging in the family room, spread out on the couches and chairs like a troop of monkeys.

\"Mind your own business,\" Gretchen said. \"Nobody pays you to think.\"

Margaret stood up to her full 5\' 9 ½ \". She\'d always been a big girl, now she was an even bigger woman in her fifties. Gretchen Beekmans was spindly as a Norfolk pine and twice as prickly. Margaret took a step forward and Gretchen held her ground, though Margaret thought she saw her swallow spit.

A Nerf ball flew between the two women. It landed in Gretchen\'s lame idea of a salad: iceberg lettuce, pale, watery tomatoes and Baco-bits. \"Who threw that? That\'s an automatic black point for the day.\"

The silence of the dead lengthened from the family room where every kid pretended to be reading a magazine or doing their homework.

Gretchen stomped over to the salad and removed the Nerf ball. At least the kids got to pick their salad dressing instead of having to choke down one of Grinchen\'s over-vinegared conconctions that routinely brought on bouts of choking from the tart, \_\_\_\_\_ bite.

Grinchin said to Margaret, \"We\'ll take this up with Dr. Hazey later.\" She whacked the dinner gong that doubled as a mediation gong. It sat on the side board and its rich bell filled the dining room like a new round of a prize fight.

Shit, shit, shit, Margaret said to herself. Me and my big yap.

The vision of the line of pill bottles marched like obedient soldiers across the marble counter came to her. It occurred to her that maybe she had something she could hold over Hazey, if Grinchin tried to force her out.

How do you explain a medicine cabinet full of other people\'s drugs? She\'d make sure to ask Hazey when he wasn't stoned.

Margaret establishes what she wants.

So she didn\'t have a college degree. So what? She didn\'t even have a high school diploma \-- she had Charlie, her big 27 year old boy, she\'d had to drop out of school for when she and Lloyd had been humping like rabbits in the backseat of his car. She remembered having one leg draped over the back of the seat. The feel of the plastic under her butt. And the burst of stars the day she had her first orgasm which was fairly late in a lot of rodeo rides. Since Lloyd hurt his back, she missed the rodeo rides and she hoped old Lloyd wasn\'t permanently out to pasture or she didn\'t know what she\'d do. She\'d seen vibrators in the window of the Coeur d\'Alene Love Nest, but can\'t imagine being that desperate for a piece of cold rubber.

Grinchin had the degrees, both a college degree from Central Washington University in Ellensburg and a Masters in Nutrition she never tired of bragging on from the University of Washington. What those degrees hadn\'t taught her was how to make a goddamned thing that was edible.

Margaret knew in her heart of hearts that she could cook circles around skinny Gretchen. What was it about skinny people that made them so bad at food? Margaret and Lloyd had gone to a Christmas party at the owner of the freight hauling business Lloyd drove for, when he wasn\'t laid up because of his back. The wife of the owner of Idaho Freight was a tiny, bird-boned woman, no bigger than a 12-year-old child. Margaret had never tasted a worse Xmas spread. \_\_\_\_ potato salad. Tarts with a kind of watery quiche that tasted like lard and blue cheese. You weren\'t sure if they were supposed to be dessert or dinner bites \-- they were mixed in with the brownies from Safeway and Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies that were the size and consistency of hockey pucks. \"Isn\'t the food divine?\" the owner\'s wife had trilled. \"My tennis friend just started a catering business and I\'m her first customer.\" Margaret hoped the woman was her last customer, grimly thinking about the Christmas party next year, assuming Lloyd wouldn\'t get permanently laid off if his back didn\'t improve.

She could do the cook\'s job that Gretchen was supposed to be doing and the kids would think they\'d died and gone to heaven. She didn\'t have the proper degrees but she had common sense enough to follow a recipe and try some variations to improve the taste. Hell, she\'d take a nutrition class at night and now that she was motivated to learn and not blinded by her own hormones and Lloyd\'s football player\'s butt, she\'d be just fine at studying and reading the material.

She slapped the last place setting of cutlery next to the plate. Gretchen wandered by and she turned the knife over at each place setting where Margaret set the knife blade facing away from the fork.

**Margaret**

Around ten, Hazey called Margaret into his wood-paneled office. Gretchen, who was at her desk filling out menus, shot Margaret a Grinchy smile. Margaret\'s heart sank. Had Gretchen ratted her out for complaining about the burnt oatmeal?

Margaret needed her crappy, low paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional psychiatric treatment facility West of the Mississippi." That's how she'd heard Gretchen describe Inner Horizons on the phone with a colleague trolling for another job.

Margaret couldn't afford to leave Inner Horizons, no matter how crappy the job. Her husband, Hank, ruptured a disk moving a 300-pound patient at his job as a nurse at Benewah Health. They'd been living on one income for 18 months. The taxes on their ten-acre farm were due next month. She had no idea how she was going to pay them.

Hazey was enthroned behind his gleaming walnut desk. Not a loose paper on it. Only a folder and a Mont Blanc pen shaped like a bullet disturbed its blankness.

\"Gretchen said you contravened her authority and questioned her personal worth in front of the residents.\" Hazey loved to talk in big words with giant mouthfuls of syllables. In fact, what she'd said to Gretchen Beener, the world's only trained dietician unable to follow a recipe, was, \"This oatmeal tastes like charcoal. The kids won't eat it."

Hazey's eyes focused, then unfocused, as if he was both here and not here.

\"The oatmeal was burned,\" Margaret said, carefully. \"The kids were complaining. Wouldn't eat it.\"

\"They\'re always complaining,\" he said. \"They\'re kids.\"

Well, Hazey had that right. Even though all the kids in the program had psychiatric issues, they were still, at heart, kids. Quick to laugh at her dumb jokes. Quick to whine and complain. Quick to point out the disappointing behavior of adults. Just like her own kids in their teenage years, just more fucked up, and with parents who weren't worried about defaulting on their taxes.

\"I\'m a good cook,\" Margaret said. "Maybe I could take over breakfast. Gretchen says she doesn\'t have enough time for meal planning.\" Gretchen also complained that she was dying for a cigarette which perhaps accounted for the fact that every taste bud on the woman's tongue was charred to a crisp.

Hazey frowned down at the folder in his lap as if he was learning how to read. He was was silent for what seemed like five minutes, until Margaret asked, "Is everything OK?\"

\"I need a vacation," he said. "The stress is killing me.\" From her perch on the edge of the chair in front of his desk. Margaret could see that Hazey was staring at a glossy color brochure gloved in an official looking leather cover. The cover photo glowed with a setting sun over a tropical blue ocean and gently waving coconut palms.

Hazey didn't look stressed. Reclined back in his chair with his feet on the desk, the head of Inner Horizons appeared to be in his early forties though he had just turned 50, the same age as Margaret. He was tall and regal-looking, with a full head of salt-and-pepper hair, freshly gelled. His professorial tweedy sport jacket had suede elbow patches, his slacks neatly pressed. A red paisley tie gave a slight impression of spinning eyeballs.

Two big shoe soles were thrust in her immediate field of vision and that's what sat her back in her chair. One size 12 foot was encased in a black wingtip with a shiny, flesh-colored sole. The other, jauntily crossed at the ankle, was shod in brown. It was a wingtip, but scuffed and worn through on the sole.

"Dr. Hazey, do you know your shoes don\'t match?\"

The doctor's head edged the palm trees over an inch and peered at the feet that were resting like two large barges on the lake of his desk. A long pause, as if the news took a few heartbeats to reach his brain. \"Damn. I can\'t meet Lydia Hunt\'s mother in these.\"

The only family of Lydia Hunt that Margaret knew about were her grandparents who owned a worldwide freight hauling business in Detroit. She hadn't even known Lydia had a mother. Margaret racked her brain and couldn't recall any phone calls or letters that warned she was making a fly-by.

"I thought her grandparents had custody?"

Hazey shook his head. His hair didn't move. "Her mother shares custody but she has to see Lydia once a quarter or she'll lose it."

In Yakima, where Margaret came from, custody was when they drove you in the back of a police car to the Walla-Walla penitentiary. Did children turn into custodial assets you fought over if you were rich?

"Lydia swears she won't see her." Hazey sighed.

"Look on the bright side. The odds are good that she won't notice your shoes."

Whatever Hazey meant to tell her was supplanted by the shoe mix-up, and the next thing Margaret knew, she found herself driving to Hazey's house behind the wheel of his new Lexus SUV. She was out of gas so he handed over his keys with a look of misgiving. She was amazed to drive a car with only 1600 miles on the odometer and heated leather seats. She got the Lexus up to 80 on Highway 90 before she hit the turn-off to the gated community on the west shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene. She parked in the driveway of an austere, cold-looking contemporary house of steel and concrete that seemed to go on forever. The house had lake views from every window, with black slate floors and black shiny counters, and framed art of black splattered ink blots that looked like someone had thrown darts in a paint can. When she finally located the master suite, she found a black whirlpool bath in the bathroom and two walk-in closets bigger than Margaret's entire living room.

Hazey's closet---shit in a Size 13 shoe!\-- held about forty pairs of Italian loafers neatly organized side by side in mahogany cubby holes. Anybody could make the same mistake with so many of the same damn shoes, she thought, except that the closet had a chandelier big enough to light up a small city. Who would put a chandelier where no one would see it? Margaret had a long held opinion that getting a Ph.d pushed out most of one's common sense, and the unmade bed with a white coverlet proved it.

Margaret plucked the black mate to the loafer on Dr. Hazey\'s surprisingly narrow EE feet, then headed back to the kitchen.

She decided to grab a cup of tea -- what good was a hot water dispenser if you didn't use it? -- and was rustling about in the cupboards for a cup when she heard the clanging of garbage bins. Rusty Harrow, who owned the local dump, had a contract to pick up trash for the Program because unincorporated Kootenai County was too backward to have official garbage service. His pig-truck was now parked in the driveway behind Margaret's car, blocking her in.

Short and stocky, Rocky had a balding patch on the back of his head which was shone like a pale beacon as he pawed head down in in Hazey's garbage. He held up a pan to closer inspection. Margaret assumed he was collecting whatever was salvageable to sell at the dump he'd inherited from his old man. Margaret had gone to high school with Rusty back in the day.

Margaret was used to seeing Rusty pick up trash at Healing House or some of the other six residences that made up Hazey's empire. Occasionally, his rickety green truck sped by her on her way to work as he passed Stranger Road on his way back to Harrow Dump. She hadn't talked to him in years, other than to yell at him for leaving the bins overturned at Healing House yard or to remind him to pick up the yard clippings he always forgot. He looked like time hadn't been much kinder to him than it had been to Margaret. He'd always been built like a fireplug, but now his greasy hair was receding and he'd gone to flab around the middle, though he was still powerfully muscled in the shoulders from hefting barrels his whole life. It was possible his Carrhardt overalls had started out light beige but they were now dark with filth. She still remembered the musty, feral smell that trailed him in the halls of Coeur D'Alene High and how people complained about having to sit near him. It was possible he hadn't bathed since then. The skin on the back of his neck was dark as dirt and his sweatshirt was encrusted with stains. Everybody knew there something off about Stan Harrow, Rusty's dad, who had started Harrow Dump some time in the fifties. He beat the shit out of all the Harrow kids until they ran off. Rusty was the only one who stayed.

The smell of smoke wafted into the kitchen through the cat door. Margaret hadn't seen any sign of a cat but you never knew what kind of secrets her boss kept. Damn. Now Rusty was taking a smoke break on the front steps. Holy Shmolean, would the man never leave?

On no impulse that Margaret could name except maybe Pandora\'s box and a missing kitty, went back up to the master bathroom, to look around. While she was scratching her head at Hazey's choice of a white loveseat in the master suite -- that did it, her boss was certifiable \-- she went into the bathroom to use the black, low-slung toilet. Maybe Alma, Hazey's ex-wife who was rumored to have run away with a horse whisperer, wanted to get away from the couch that would never stay clean.

Margaret washed her hands and idly popped the door to the medicine cabinet thinking she'd cadge an Advil for her aching knees. Holy shit! Hazey\'s cabinet was a drug cornucopia that rivaled Inner Horizons medical stock room for the residents. Her first thought on seeing the rows and rows of pills was that Hazey must be dying. HIV/AIDS? Cancer? But then she started to read the labels one by one and a different diagnosis started to become clear.

A newly filled prescription for Klonopin. Another one for Atavan. Diazepam. Valium. Delaudid. Tirazepam. A bottle labeled Klonazepam fell off the shelf that Margaret was pushing pill bottles around so she could read the labels. When she picked it up, she saw that it was prescribed to April Cohen. Margaret knew an April Cohen whom she remembered clearly as a starved New Yorker with the investment banker dad who moved her to McLain at Harvard when they opened their new anorexia wing.

An Adderall prescription was made out to Reza Silverstein. \_\_\_ milligrams per day, to be taken in the morning. Reza was the motor-mouth ADHD kid from Camden, New Jersey, who was recovering from a Meth addiction and still couldn't sit still for love nor money. Hazey had gained weight after Alma's departure but lately, he'd been bragging about how he'd lost over twenty-five pounds." He'd punctuated how easy it was --"just like that!" \-- with a snap of his fingers. "Just say no!" he said to her when he caught her looking at a third cupcake during his stupid birthday that staff -- meaning her---had organized.

Was Dr. Arlen Aloyisius Hazey saying No to food while he said Yes to Reza Silverstein's Adderall and Jeannine Possly's Ozempic?

Behind a bunch of pill bottles prescribed to people whose names Margaret didn't recognize, she found a half-full bottle of Tirazepam prescribed to Angela \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Margaret's maternal hackles went up. Angela, AKA Old Girl, OG for short, had a hell of a time sleeping. The kid was famous with the Night Supervisors as a card shark. It was common knowledge that if you needed help staying awake on your shift, all you had to do was walk by OG's room and she'd come out with a deck of cards.

Margaret loved her. OG was wicked funny. Not a complainer. Personally, she would have preferred that Old Girl would bitch and moan or even howl at the moon if it helped relieve the poor kid from her unrelenting depression and grief.

Occasionally, Gloria, the nurse, would use Tirazedone to give Old Girl a night of rest; you couldn't keep her on it too long without getting dependent. Was Hazey using it to to calm himself down? If the man got any calmer, he'd be practically catatonic.

Yesterday at Process Group, Old Girl had asked Margaret about the danger of falling icicles. "You're not thinking of standing under one are you?" Margaret had asked.

"What---you think I've got a hole in my head?" Old Girl said.

"No, but I think you might want one."

"You never let me get away with anything!"

Old Girl tossed a floppy carrot-colored deadlock away from her face and sighed. "Of all nut houses in the world, I get the one with Mother Fucking Teresa."

"Margaret Fucking Teresa, if you don't mind," Margaret said.

Next to OG's bottle of Tirazedone, another bottle of Tirazedone was prescribed to James Olson, who had come to Inner Horizons about six months ago from a Wilderness Program. If there was one thing Margaret knew about teenagers because she had two of them, it was that they slept the sleep of the dead and acted like irritable grizzlies if you woke them up. No way was James Olson taking Tirazedone for sleep. The boy was quiet, not like the rest of the magpies, so he wasn't taking it for anxiety either. Margaret had discovered a stash of books hidden under the boy's bed that ranged from Great Expectations to Moby Dick. Books Margaret wished she'd read at his age instead of Seventeen Magazine and Cosmopolitan. Now she had no time to read because she had to fork hay out in the field for the horses or break the ice in their water trough with an axe, which were all the outside chores Hank used to do before he was laid up.

By the time Margaret counted up all the labels on the shelves, she had 89 prescriptions of a psychotropic nature, the majority for kids who had left the program.

Halfway through her inventory, she heard Rusty Harrow's truck rumble and choke down the driveway like it was on its last legs, but Margaret\'s busy brain was adding up the conundrum of the enormous drug stash in Dr. Hazey\'s bathroom. Most of the plastic bottles marching across the shelves like faceless soldiers were dated from the last two years, all for kids Margaret knew or had known. Earlier than that, she recognized a few names but mostly she had no idea who the people were.

But those records were available in Hazey\'s locked records room. Margaret cleaned there every week and she knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the top right-hand drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and anybody else who wanted to know things he didn't want them to know but was too lazy to hide. If Hazey was writing new prescriptions for whatever drug he wanted in the names of every kid he\'d ever treated, those records would tell the tale.

By the time she tried to put a zillion bottles back on the crammed shelves, she regretted taking them down. Damn. What if Hazey, now incontrovertibly nuts in Margaret\'s mind, had organized his drugs in a certain order? She finally gave up worrying and just randomly tucked the drugs wherever she made space. Nothing she could do about it if Hazey figured out that she\'d spent an interesting half hour perusing his personal Pleasure Chest.

She was so distracted, she almost forgot the black wingtip she\'d been sent for.

Thank God she remembered it when she about to pull out of Hazey's circular driveway. Every other driveway in the hoity-toity neighborhood had berms of shoveled snow and patches of snow and ice. Oh my every loving God. Hazey's driveway had *heated* pavers that melted any snow flake that had the temerity to fall from the sky on the Good Doctor's fiefdom.

She left the SUV running. Retraced her path to the kitchen for the shoe. She stepped over a long curl of brown sausage skin twisted on the top step like a coiled snake. Rusty Harrow\'s calling card. Trouble in paradise, doc, right next to the five feet tall topiary rabbit Hazey was so proud of.

**Lydia**

Her itch was the size of Godzilla. Lydia had been hoping the newbie would be a boy. Actually, a hella-boy with a hella-itch. She had been seriously bummed when the tall bleary-eyes girl named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when they told her she could have herbal tea!

James had stuttered all the way through his accountability list during Process: Darlene's lame idea of "welcoming" the new girl. He spoke to the popcorn-coated ceiling while a flush crept from his shirt collar and climbed his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school?

James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Lydia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Lydia's experience, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch and its implacability, they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

You could have knocked Lydia down when Rachel dropped like a pile driver into James's lap. Why James? The girl jerked and popped like the whore strung out on Angel Dust Lydia had seen in Times Square on New Year's Eve. *They should have given her the coffee,* flashed through Lydia's mind.

Darlene yelled at her to get a towel and Lydia ran to the kitchen. What the hell good was a fucking towel? she wondered, until Darlene rolled it up and forced it between Rachel's teeth. Lydia plopped in Darlene's chair while the seizure shook the girl like a rat terrier. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary Lydia couldn't watch, which was lucky because she spotted Darlene's bag sitting next to the wingback. A wallet was clearly visible on top. Everybody else tuned into the horror show, so Lydia plucked a twenty-dollar bill and it was safe in her pocket before the twitching finally stopped.

Darlene and Bruce bundled Rachel up in a blanket. When the coast was clear, Lydia nudged James from behind, their private signal, then slipped into the bathroom off the kitchen.

The bathroom was colder than a meat locker. She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the claw-footed tub naked from the waist down. It was outfitted in faux-homey Shaker shit just like the living and dining rooms. Heavy on blond oak --- even the toilet seat was wood grain--- with bead boarding on the walls and an old fashioned claw-footed tub the size of an iceberg. James had better be quick or Lydia would shiver herself into an orgasm. Was that even possible?

While she waited behind the shower curtain, she speculated on the purpose of the tub. Who would put a tub next to a kitchen? she wondered. Didn't people in the West get the concept of a powder room? Or was that an East coast thing? There wasn't even a showerhead in the tub. All the showers were at the ends of the dorm halls. She supposed they'd been added on at some point when they turned an old farmhouse into a crazy house.

Lydia could hear one of the maids at her aunt's mansion in Montreal where she always stayed when Mom got remarried telling her to "get in and get out" of the tub before David, her cousin, figured out she was taking a bath. The maids were afraid of him and they weren't the only ones waiting in dread for 15-year-old David to crawl in bed with her "to get to know her."

Maybe that was why David, who was three years older, started crawling in bed with her when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. This was perhaps the only kind thought she'd ever had about kitten-killer David. Was this Inner Horizons shit finally working? She dismissed the thought like a bad smell in the room.

The jingle of the shower rings cued Lydia to climb up James's body faster than Pavlov's dog. She threw her legs around his waist and James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He was kissing her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard. The door shut and the pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear. "That was close."

"Not as close as this." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands and held them away from his waist.

"Don't," he said. "I can't concentrate. Not after all the shit that went down."

By then, Lydia's itch was pounding like jungle drums. She had a momentary flash of empathy with the epileptic girl who'd had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Lydia was having inside without any flopping or jerking. "Don't concentrate. Don't even think!" If James didn't help her get off, she was going to fly into a million jagged pieces.

"Chill," James said, as the curtain rings jangled behind him.

The temperature in the tub dropped another twenty degrees. Pavlov's dog had an empty bowl.

091019 White head and whitehead

She resolutely pushed the face of the dead boy -- white, inert, staring --away from her. She concentrated on the goings on down the table. Get away from me, dead boy. Leave me in the land of the living where I can do something about all this pus.

She opened the door to the incessant ringing of the doorbell. A white faced boy was strung up between two burly men in matching fish hats and Cabela jackets. The men were in a hurry to light up, apparently, so within minutes, she was left in her flannel nightgown sitting awkwardly next to the boy on the couch. She tried not to breathe strep throat germs all over him wondering where the hell Margaret was.

At his question of 'where am I?', a quote from an ancient AP English class came to mind. "Is this hell or am I in't?" she said.

Then, with a jerk of a scrawny arm that encompassed all the portraits on the wall, he asked, "Who are all these cats?" referring, it seemed, to their eternal severe and judgmental expressions.

"People who died here," she said, hoping to add a note of levity to the situation that the boy didn't get to understand.

"What's your name," she asked.

He was busy slapping at himself, patting his back pockets, his chest, his knee, his thigh, and even one surprisingly delicate ankle as if he was working on a Mr. Bones act, while he swallowed what sounded like Jason or Chasen or possibly Mason.

"What are you looking for? Did you lose something?"

"Anything," he said. "You got something on you?" Which was universal code for weed or meth or crank or whatever he was high on that was beginning to drain from his blood stream.

OG was covered from neck to toes in a red flannel nightgown like a grandma. Her socks belonged to Rachel. They were star spangled. She raised her own arms and patted ruefully at her thighs. "No pockets," she apologized, like her own crank had been left in the pockets of her jeans which were sitting next to her bed.

"Bummer." Another universal reply.

"Is this hell or am I in't," she said again. Sometimes AP English came in handy at the strangest moments.

A joint, life-wearying sigh bonded one to the other in a shared moment of depression and despair.

Margaret banged through the big double doors. The paint gun rifle was cracked open over her arm. "Damn raccoons," she was muttering. "I need more ammo to take them out."

When Margaret saw OG on the couch, she said automatically, "You! What are you doing out of bed. Get back under the covers before I have to bury you."

The strange visitor, now scratching furiously at something in his armpit took Margaret's pronouncement with a wondering expression. "Hell and now I'm in it? Is that what you said?"

OG shrugged. "Good luck." She halfway meant it. What she really wanted to say is "you'll need it."

"Back to bed, missy," Margaret shooed her off down the hall. "Strep throat is nothing to sneeze at."

OG listed back to her room, holding onto the wall to keep her upright. When she looked back at the kid on the couch, he was stretched out against the pillows and she caught a glimpse of his flat white belly with an outie navel that reminded her of the white head she'd noticed sprouting in the crack between his nose and his cheek. Should she have mentioned it? How it was at the perfect state of ripeness to pop? Or should she gone to her room to get her own tube of Oxiclean to lend him? None of the above, she told herself. She was leaning against the wall, feeling too sick to holder herself up, and all she wanted to do was crawl under the covers and die.

The next time she saw the white head, the boy who was growing it would be dead.

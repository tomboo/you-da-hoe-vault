012115 they did it for the money

No question Nick and Aarthi did the malaria study for the money. Aarthi now makes \$15 an hour and she doesn't get any benefits at her new job, though she does get the joy of working with a lot more modern equipment than Seattle Biomed could afford. Nick makes \$37,000 a year (until funding...) . When Seattle Biomed told Nick that he had to fill out benefit forms, they had to bring in someone to help him because he'd never done it. The first time's the best, his dad told him.

These are smart, educated people steeped in science. They know the odds against getting malaria are good, or the trial wouldn't have been approved. And if by chance the stubborn parasites get through, they also know the drugs to cure it are good., as long as you're not poor, black and living in an African village with no access to medical care. "People get infected with malaria all the time and don't get to stay in a hotel for ten days with three doctors to tend you. I wasn't scared a bit," said Nick.

Still, both said the experience of offering one's flesh to 200 feeding anopheles mosquitoes was "nerve wracking" (Aarthi) and "off-putting" (Nick).

"You could see all 200 of them flying and hopping and making their way up to the mesh and looking around for something to feed on," Aarthi said. The whole time she held her arm over the mesh, it felt counter to her natural instincts of self-preservation. "you want to slap at them but you can't. Your body is telling you, 'You need to move your arm! But your mind is saying, 'Don't move! Don't dump a load of infected mosquitoes in this room!'" There was a lot of joking in the test room about not letting the mosquitoes out to infect their peers because there wasn't enough money around to pay more people.

Steve, the \_\_\_\_\_\_ (title) made a valiant but lame attempt to distract the small group.

The room off the insectary where the mosquitoes are bred was small and claustrophobic. The techs passed the mosquitoes through a glass window in a sealed room, so no mosquitos can escape. Nick says the quart-size \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (name) looked like Molly Moon ice cream containers "without the good stuff."

At one point, Steve asked, "What is the largest landlocked port in the US?" Nobody guessed right until Steve said it was San Francisco and then the group hooted him off the floor. "That's ridiculous!" Scientists question everything.

When the trivia distraction switched to baseball, Aarthi, who's not a sports fan, concentrated on a malaria education poster tacked to the wall. "In the timek you're watching a TV show, you could be saving a life," it said. Aarthi was telling herself that she only had to spend 10 minutes to save lives, not even the 30 minutes of TV show watching on the poster.

Everybody compared bites when it was over. Nick had a several hundred bites like little dots all over the patch on his forearm; they all swelled up and turned red when the histamines in the red wine I served got into his blood stream.

Aarthi told us that her bites started out like islands of puffiness. "Then the whole thing puffed up and it looked like one giant mosquito bite." Overnight, it swelled up even more, "until it was one soft congealed mass of itch."

Aarthi couldn't sleep ll night. "I kept waking Nick up all night\--." She pauses, with a little embarrassed laugh, like she's not sure if I know she and Nick are sleeping together. I want to say, hey, I remember hormones very well. In fact, I miss them every day since turning 50. Since I'm not writing about that middle-aged woman's word that starts with an M, let's return to those mosquitos.

The mosquitoes that bit Nick & Aarthi on January 8, 2015, carry malaria parasites genetically altered or "attenuated" by the researchers in Stefan Kappe's lab to weaken them. They'll know if someone in the study comes down with malaria by the early February. There not too much time to wait for Nick's mom and dad and Aarthi's father and mother and the families and friends of the rest of the study participants, not to mention Stefan Kappe and his research team, along with the President of Seattle Biomed, Alan Aderem, who need the funding to complete the studies and find a delivery mechanism for a vaccine that must be delivered to to millions of people at risk.

My husband, Tom and I are doing the best we while waiting on parental tenterhooks for the study results. In part I wrote this essay to distract myself.

The malaria parasite took about a week to enter Nick's blood stream and mount its (EXPLAIN THE TIMELINE FOR MALARIA TO TAKE OVER)

Meanwhile, we wait. Will Nick and Aarthi get the disease? Will they make it into a graduate program at the same school so they can perhaps entertain the M words? Will it be possible for the M word to be followed by the C word that Aarthi's mom and I are afraid to bring up? Will the US Government relax the strangle-hold on science funding so that these two lovers and thousands of post docs, junior researchers, mid-career scientists and even rock star scientists can continue their studies and find new answers to the world's problems?

As my mother used to say, worry about one thing and the rest will follow.

Seattle Biomed is a nonprofit research institution with a 40 year history of studying orphan diseases that --big surprise!---Big Pharma has no interest in. Think river blindness and Chagas disease and sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis, the disease that Nick and Aarthi were working on when they met---that's the one that causes boils and runaway infections in poor people from Saudi Arabia to the Sudan and anywhere in the undeveloped world where sand flies breed.

Nick has experienced first hand the malaise and dread that can beset a research institution when funding dries up. A few months ago, one of his research mentors at Seattle Biomed summarily lost her funding. The woman's grant didn't even run out. It was just cancelled out of the blue and 15 years of research went down the drain. Of course she had two weeks to clear out her desk and figure out the next step in a life devoted to science.

Seattle Biomed's shrinkage isn't unique. Government funded labs all over America are downsizing, academic institutions are squeezing people out and investigators around the US are quailing, wondering how to go on without the necessary life flow of money to fund their own salaries, as well as the salaries of their research teams plis all the expensive equipment needed for increasingly complex studies, including the massive computational power required by to genetically-based research like Kappe's malaria studies.

Aarthi reminds me "when the US Government opened up funding for cholesterol studies, twelve Nobel laureates and the studies that gave us statins that are now saving millions of lives was the result." Nick makes a strong --and most heartfelt---argument for the US government to open its coffers for more scientific research instead of letting the US lag 50 years behind the rest of the world. "It's impossible to know where knowledge will take you\-- or where it will go," Nick says. "Thinking that's based on curiosity is how we make progress.

Everybody knows the story of how penicillin, another lifesaver, came about.

In 1928, a bacteria researcher named Alexander Fleming noticed a green mold growing on some of the bacteria in his petri dishes that he surmised came from the open window. That's the story we all know. In fact, nothing happened with this information

Many essential elements of how all chemical synapses function were first discovered by studying the squid giant synapse.  Early electrophysiological studies demonstrated the chemical nature of transmission at this synapse by making simultaneous intracellular recording from the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals in vitro ([Theodore Holmes Bullock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Holmes_Bullock) and Hagiwara (1957), Hagiwara and[Ichiji Tasaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichiji_Tasaki) (1958), Takeuchi and Takeuchi (1962)). Classical experiments later on demonstrated that, in the absence of action potentials, transmission could occur (Bloedel et al. (1966), Katz and Miledi (1967), Kusano et al. (1967)). The [calcium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium) hypothesis for synaptic transmission was directly demonstrated in this synapse by showing that at the [equilibrium potential](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_potential) for calcium, no transmitter is released ([Bernard Katz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Katz) and R. Miledi 1967). Thus, calcium entry and not the change in the transmembrane electric field *per se* is responsible for transmitter release (Llinas et al. 1981, Augustine et al. 1985). This preparation continues to be the most useful for the study of the molecular and cell biological basis for transmitter release. Other important new mammalian preparations are now available for such studies such as the [calyx of Held](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calyx_of_Held).

In 1937, [John Zachary Young](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Zachary_Young) suggested that the [squid giant axon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_giant_axon) could be used to study neuronal electrical properties.[^\[15\]^](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron#cite_note-15) Being larger than but similar in nature to human neurons, squid cells were easier to study. By inserting electrodes into the giant squid axons, accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential.

In 1952, physiologists **Alan Hodgkin** and **Andrew Huxley** made some important discoveries about how neurons transmit information. They studied giant squid, whose neurons have giant axons. By putting tiny electrodes inside these axons, Hodgkin and Huxley found that nerve impulses are really electrochemical reactions.

Cross pollination happens all the time in good science. It's why collaboration and the Internet which allows instantaneous sharing of information has changed the pace of research advancement. It's well known that giant squid studies in 1928 contributed hugely to our current knowledge of brain neurons and how they transimit information through electrochemical reactions. Anyone with glial cancer, like Nick's grandfather had, or Parkinson's disease, like a fine advertising copywriter who worked for me, can thank the researchers who parsed the giant neuros of the equally giant squid: knowledge that led to huge progress in our current understanding of the brain.

It's tempting to wax metaphorical on how Nick and Aarthi are willing to give their life's blood to science. I won't because their small but brave contribution to scientific pales in comparison to the Madame Curie's death by radiation poisoning, or even the way naturalist Karl Schmidt ended his career at the Field Museum when he ws bitten by a boomslang sent as a gift by a friend.

People who love science make pece with its risks. Did I mention that Stefan Kappe, the Lead PI in the malaria study sat in the same room as Nick and Aarthi, forearm bared to the parasites he had painstakingly attenuated in genetic studies over the past 20 years?

If you've reached this point I a mother's plea for science funding so her kid can make a living, you're probably thinking I'm a self-focused, bleeding heart liberal. Card-carrying, flag waving. Proud of it.

Not every scientific endeavor leads to advancement. Far from it. Marilyn Parson, the PI who Nick works for, has spent her entire career searching for a break through in leishmaniasis which hasn't had a new drug developed for more than 50 years. Imagine the progress we might make if the US government put some money toward leishmania parasite. But oh, I forgot, what do we care about children in Iran or Iraq or Brazil forever scratching at their dirty lesions?

Nick and Aarthi have applied to some of the same schools in California and Colorado, but they've also applied to schools as far flung as Florida and Baltimore and Pennsylvania. Aarthi goes for an interview at Johns Hopkins in early Feb ruary; hopefully she won't be taking drugs to treat malaria while she's interviewing.

First they have to get in to one of the graduate programs when the competition is intense. Then they have to get into the same institution, or at least in the same geographic regions which ups the odds. It takes six or seven years to get a Ph.D and you can see why the M word is forbidden to the lovers, parents and anyone else who fantasizes that love can conquer all.

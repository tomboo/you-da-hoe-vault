What Rusty Does After the Fire

Rusty supervised the placement of the Sealand container. He wanted it near the trailer where he could keep an eye on it. He\'d had to pay extra to move out his collection of junkers that he harvested for parts. It cost more than he thought but it was worth it. Now he\'d be able to go back and forth between where he lived and where he\'d keep the blond girl.

He\'d already picked up the space heaters. As soon as the tractor unhooked he\'d start to work running electricity for lights and heat. Maybe he\'d be nice and let her have a microwave to heat stuff up. It was move fun to think of the things he was going to do to her than it was to think of how she was going to live in the dark and uninsulated space. He made a note on the clipboards. Blankets could be found at the Povarello Bargain Basement, he guessed. By the time people took bedspreads or quilts to the dump, they were pretty far gone.

He wished he\'d thought of setting up the container to live in earlier. Than he\'d have time to look through stuff that people threw out for what he\'d need. He\'d found some dishes and silverware they\'d thrown out at Hazey\'s house. And the day after the fire he\'d hauled the smoky mattress and box springs Margaret \_\_\_\_(find last name that relates to care giving) had thrown out.

He could smell the smoke every time he went about the trailer. He hated smelling the wet cindery smell. It reminded him of the night of the fire when he realized his plan to impress the bitch had gone wrong.

Jed Semple waved from the cab of theK-whopper on his way out the rutted road. \"Lemme know when you want us to haul some gravel. Damn pot holes are big enough to fall into.\"

Russ shrugged. Who gave a shit about the people\'s cars or trucks when they came out to the dump. Everybody had trash they needed to get rid of. The place was a dump. What id they expect? The fucking Taj Mahal?

We haven\'t heard from Dr. Hazey in a while. Hazey is not happy about the fire. He doesn\'t like having the cops too close- What's an arson inspector likely to find when he\'s convinced it was one of his sickos? There were times when working for a large mental hospital appealed to him.

Every time Aloyius Hazey thought he could return to his vacation brochures, the damn door to his office would open.

Damn. He gritted his teeth at the sight of Bruce and Rosa , the most senior therapists, who were lobbying for Inner Journey to send them to Seattle for a conference on Evidence Based Anti-Suicide Modalities in Treating Borderline Anxiety Disorders. Hazey knew Marsha Linehan, the national guru of dialectical behavior therapy. He\'d seen the ancient scars on her wrist. A cutter and a veteran of who-the-hell knew how many suicide attempts.

\"We\'re falling behind the rest of the field,\" Rosa was saying. \"Here\'s a way to give us some DBT skills while we\'re getting CLE hours.\"

Hazey wished he\'d chosen a field that didn\'t have so many acronyms. CLE? Oh that was credit hours so they could keep up their accreditation.

\"How much?\" he said.

\"\$3000 per person,\" Bruce said, handing him the shiny brochure that showed an adoring circle of acolytes surrounding a stern looking woman in a white coat. Hazey had a vivid memory of Marsha as a post doc swilling vodka and telling a rowdy joke to a bunch of grad students while he had been a lowly assistant. Why didn\'t he stay in academia when he had the chance instead of starting a clinic in the worst place to grow a career.

\"And how many therapists need the hours?\"

Rosa hesitated,\" four-plus me and Bruce.\"

Hazey sat down at the mahogany desk and passed a hand over his eyes so he didn\'t have to see the \$18,000 goose egg they wanted him to spend.

\"You two. That\'s it. Run a class on DBT when you get back.\"

He saw how pleased they were by the look of high five that passed between them. The little shits. They had no intention of sending 6 people. They had just been covering their asses.

Gretchen stuck her head in the door right after they left and shoved a meal plan for the next month under his nose. \"Sign this would you Doc?\" Hadn\'t he signed the exact same meal plan last month? Oh what the hell. These kids needed routine, it was all that kept them from falling into chaos.

Dr. Hazey had time to pull his brochures out on the desk protector before he was interrupted by a phone call from an irate parent of some kid he could barely recall. Rochelle? Rachel? The mom was livid about the fire and the fact that her child had been in danger and they hadn\'t been alerted. S how is it you\'re calling me? he wondered until it became clear that the fire had came up in the weekly therapy call and Bruce!! The little fuckwit he\'d just agreed to send on paid vacation to Seattle- had soft-balled the complaint and told her to call the head of the program. Christ! Did no one do their fucking jobs, Hazey thought eyeing the sands of Fiji and letting the names V\_\_\_\_\_\_ and_V\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ linger n his mind like the smell of coconut oil.

What is the climax of scene? Hazey is beset by work and complaints and he wants to plan his vacation. He can shut his door in someone's face who has a real emergency. He can fail to answer a phone from the police about the arsonist. He can have a penultimate visit form Margaret about Etsy? Abut one of the kids who gets hurt? Or maybe Granpa Rosenblum calls to him about Lydia and compliments him on his progress.

The insistent Br---ings! Brings! of the phone halted the hand that had been reaching for Fiji. He wanted to ignore it. Wanted desperately to have a Fiji fling, if only in his dreams. But Hazey, the good doctor Hazey who\'d manage to get out of the house without aid of either upper or downer or even a mood leveler picked up the phone and just listened.

She did?\"

\"I\'m so happy.\"

\"Thank you for telling me.\"

By the time he hung up form Ira Rosenblum, grandfather and guardian of Lydia Rosenblum, and chairman of the Board of the Heinsz corporation, Hazey felt like he\'d inhaled a tank of laughing gas.

Ira Rosenblum was pleased with Lydia\'s progress. Ira was proud that she was thinking of something other than herself or shopping.

Ira Rosemblum felt tthat Idaho was doing his granddaughter a world of good.

Hazey had almost said, \"Really? I had no idea.\" But thankfully Ira Rosenblum wanted to talk and he wanted Hazey to listen.

The last thing he said before he hung up was \"Thank you for helping Lydia grow up.\"

Hazey set the phone down in its cradle and sat back in his leather chair. He spun it around so he was facing the icicle-fringed window which caught the glint of the winter sun. It was a distant wintery sun but to Hazey it felt like he was bathed in the warmth of the equatorial sky.

Lydia Rosenblum\'s grandfather was glad he sent her to Idaho, when he could have sent her anywhere in the world.

A- New opening to Rusty sets up the container to contain her.

Rusty had howled at the top of his lungs and slammed his fist on the wheel the night the tall kid wrapped the blond girl in a blanket. He\'d driven like a bat out of hell back to the trailer to get his rifle but by the time he got back to the nut house, they were herding everybody inside and he didn\'t see the asshole with the blanket anywhere.

He hadn\'t really had a plan. He was too furious to think. All he could see was the top of the asshole\'s head flying apart like a melon when a \_\_\_(look up bullet type that spreads out) hit him between the eyes.

It had taken a few days to calm down and come up with a better idea. He wasn\'t that interested in shooting anybody. If he just took the blond girl and put her somewhere safe away from the tall kid and his wandering hands he\'d be happy.

Jed Simplot had been trying to sell him a used container to store parts and tools that he kept in his Dad\'s old shed for months. \"Somebody\'s going to break in and steal your stash, Barrow. Buy something you can padlock.\"

Padlock. Lock. Key. He\'d read some newspaper story about African\'s living in containers. He could fix it up, make it livable for the girl.

He\'d calls Semplot the next day and like magic the container was backing into a spot he\'d cleared between his trailer and the collection of junkers he kept for spare parts.

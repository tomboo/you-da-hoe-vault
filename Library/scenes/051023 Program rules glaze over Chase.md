051023 Program rules glaze over Chase

Chase's attention wandered as the woman droned on for a long time about all the Program rules. The phrase "four months of Intensive" got him wondering what was more intense than getting rolled about of bed by two strange men who said they were sent by his parents to straighten him up and make him fly right. "No fraternization reminded him that his fraternity's Friday night Beer Pong would sorrowfully go on without him. "Process three times a week" sounded like a hair dye experience and while he wasn't 100% sure, pink might be nice. When se asked if he has any food restrictions, Chase, who hadn't eaten for a couple of days, decided cagily that he should keep to himself the fact that weed was the only thing that made him hungry. Mealtimes were at eight, noon, and six, so he was lucky that he was right on time for lunch and even luckier because she'd cooked it herself. He felt way too wired for food but the second he assessed himself as too wired, a look at his shoe reminded him of a hunger of a different sort. "Can I go to the bathroom?"

"Sure," she said. "It's right there, that door behind you. I'll tell you about Big Paul, your new roommate, when you get back. He's a little Asperbergery, but he won't talk your head off because he never says a word."

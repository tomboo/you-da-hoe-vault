01292025 OG Connects Hug to Warming

In the ticking, cooling truck, holding the man's once warm, now rapidly cooling hand, OG feels sleepy as the cold steals over her. In her mind, she's moving inward and it feels like she\'s back in the entryway of Healing House when she was burning up with fever.

Her throat was on fire with strep throat, which felt like the heat of a thousand suns, and then she felt a blast of cold blow in from the outside that made her shiver.

Two Burley EMTs are wheeling a body of someone she\'s never met to a waiting ambulance. She hears one of the EMTs say they are going straight to the morgue. So no life-saving medicine for this kid who has died in Margaret\'s arms as OG is making her shaky way, holding onto the wall, the entry to see why all the sirens were wailing in her head.

In the fever dream, it was Gabe was screaming for help but it wasn\'t Gabe who needed help in the entry way. And it wasn\'t the kid she didn't know whose body was being wrestled head first into a white bag until it covered him completely..

Margaret is the one who\'s unglued like pieces of her are flying all around the room, exactly the way OG felt when the police arrived with the news that her family every last one of them -- was dead.

Margaret babbled when she laid eyes on OG, crying and alternately moaning about how the new kid had been fine 10 minutes ago, and then he was dying in her arms until she rolled him over on his back and beat on him with chest compressions. She wailed in a breathy high voice like Gabe's, \"He wouldn\'t come back, goddamnit! I even slapped him. He wouldn\'t.\"

What OG did was what she wished someone had been able to do for her when she closed the door behind the police and sank to her knees in the entryway at home.

\"He\'s gone,\" Margaret sobbed. OG felt all the sobs that she had suppressed come up and meet Margaret\'s regrets, though not a word was exchanged.

All she could say, all anyone can say, as she patted Margaret\'s broad back, and smelled her Tide-washed sweatshirt that was matted with dog hair, was \"I know. I know.\"

Rewrite to strengthen

OG felt Margaret\'s warm breath against her cheek, while her head was buried in the crook of the big woman's neck,. The pillowy Double-DD breasts, so unlike Mom's willowy small frame, comforted her with maternal softness and solidity and an awareness of suffering from loss. Loss---the only word OG could come up with to describe how those breast felt though they were big as life, and they did their magic a second time by pulling her away from the cold in the cooling truck to look for warmth.

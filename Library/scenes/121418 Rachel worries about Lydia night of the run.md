121418 Rachel worries about Lydia night of the run

Lydia didn't show up at the pick-up spot. Nobody saw her after 3 pm when she was marked present in American History class.

"It's not a big deal," OG said to Rachel. "People go AWOL all the time."

"How do they survive?"

"They don't. They run out of money and come crawling back. Or the police pick them up. Or their parents won't take them back or give them any money to live on so there's no other option. It's starve to death or come back and start all over again in Intensive. It's a vicious cycle. You run to get away and then they make you stay twice as long when you come back. It's not worth it."

It wasn't worth running if you were too stupid or immature to plan for another life, like OG had. Her Dad's older sister, a single woman, a professor in literature at the University of Washington would take her in. Aunt Ruth. She was the black sheep of the family, married to another woman, liberal and dope smoking legally in Washington. A complete anathema to born-again Christians, Aunt Peggy and Uncle David with midwestern family values and Trump/Pence sticker on their Buick.

She hoped ardently that Lydia's sudden decision to run didn't throw a kink in her own plans. She'd strangle Lydia herself if it did. Now that she knew so much about hypoxia, she could wrap her hands around Lydia's skinny neck and squeeze. Or maybe it would be better to just leave her at Healing House to suffer. She didn't hate Lydia. Not really. But she'd like her a whole lot better if she hadn't run on the same day.

"It just seems weird," Rachel was saying. "Nobody seems worried about her."

"Oh people run all the time. It's like a rite of passage at Inner Horizons. Out there looks so much easier than in her. Until you get out there with no money, no food, no place to sleep."

OG looked out at the temperature gauge on the wall outside the entry way. "It's 16 degrees right now. It's only ten pm. It'll probably get colder."

"Well I'm worried."

"Go ahead. It won't do any good."

"Remind me never to ask you to cheer me up."

You won't get a chance to, OG thought, with the barest twinge of regret. Rachel wasn't so bad. At least she had a sense of humor which was a shit load better than getting a kleptomaniac like the one who stole her iPhone from the contraband locker.

She had kyped a key to the storage locker. About the only positive of being at the Program for almost three years, she had rifled through Hazey's desk plenty of times. The man was chronically late, so why not? What else was there to do while she waited? If she had liked the taste of Chivas Regal, she could have lifted his supersized bottle. But she didn't. She really, really preferred the taste of freedom and when she saw the key, handily marked "contraband" with masking tape, she thanked Hazed profusely when he came in at ten minutes past the hour. I really needed to collect my thoughts, she told him. Adults. They were just as lame as the kids they were paid to make well. And far less intelligent.

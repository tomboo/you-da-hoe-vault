073014 bullying scene\
\
Old Girl feels like she can\'t just watch Estie get tortured. She has to pick a side, yet she hates both Estie and the torturers.\
\
Today I\'m writing about bullying and I\'m unsure whether this is germane to my novel.

Old Girl witnesses two program kids torturing ESTIE, the fat, nearly catatonic, brain damaged girl who doesn\'t talk much because she\'s lost some essential part of her brain. What is left in Estie\'s brain is rageful and violent. She\'s a kettle waiting to boil over and the tormentors are treating her like a person who can\'t or won\'t fight back. That bugs her because she hates being a victim herself. Old Girl starts the scene wanting to slap Estie herself, if they weren\'t already picking on her. By the end, when Estie blows up, Old Girl is applauding the way she drives a fork into the back of Reza\'s meddling hand.\
\
The imagery is of a long fuse that is lit by each snarky comment, every poke or jab that Reza and Danny get in. Old Girl has the impression of a baited snake waiting for its moment to tuck it\'s body in the launching coil and throw itself one third of its body length.\
\
Old Girl watched all the needling and poking that went deep into Estie's lardy bulk and it occurred to her that the fat girl's eyes were no longer hazy and unfocused as they had been an hour ago when Margaret and Gretchen had half dragged, have supported her to a seat on the couch. At first, Estie failed to register any of their witticisms. *You stink!   When are you going to take a shower? Jesus, you smell like R. Kelly\'s sheets.* For all of their pokes, it was like Estie was a bowl of jelly; she just quivered when the jabs landed. She absorbed their meanness and Old Girl wanted to slap her herself after a while. Christ, can\'t you defend yourself, you\'re bigger than Reza! He was wiry, small as a ferret. Danny was tall but Estie outweighed her by 60 or 70 pounds. She could have hoisted Danny on one shoulder and thrown her out a window without even breaking a sweat.\
\
Estie\'s non-responses made the three of them even more determined to be assholes. Most people would\'ve given up within 15 minutes but Danny and Reza just turned up their meanness like turning up the heat on a particularly heavy pan.

Usually Old Girl stayed out of the petty house dramas, the perpetually, swirling power plays where somebody always had to be on top and somebody got kicked to the bottom. Estie just pissed her off because she was such a dumb ass that she couldn\'t or wouldn\'t fight them. Was it picking on someone when they were too stupid to know who was friend or foe? Without thinking, Old Girl blurted, \"Estie is piss-poor at holding her water.\" The look of hurt on Estie\'s bovine face didn\'t make Old Girl regret joining with the enemy. It made her think, you wet your own bed, now lie in it.\
\
That\'s why she sat as far away from her at dinner as possible. She went to the bottom of the table and left Estie alone to deal with Reza on one side of her and Danny on the other. Paul, who had joined their torture klatsch, plonked down opposite her on the other side of the table. They had her surrounded.\
\
Old Girl watched them block Estie from receiving the platters of food that were passing counterclockwise around the table. When the meatloaf came to Danny, she skipped Estie and slid gray meat across the table to Paul who sent it down his side of the table. Reza sent the potatoes, then the gray peas the opposite direction. The only real food that landed with n Estie's reach was the limp spinach salad with no dressing. Only Darlene was allowed to dress salad because half the kids including Estie were on restricted calorie diets. It didn\'t seem to be having any affect on Estie\'s bulk.\
\
\"Hey, you skipped me with the meatloaf,\" Estie said to Danny.\
\
\"I didn\'t,\" Danny said sweetly, shooting her a shocked blue-eyed look. \"You said you didn\'t want any.\"\
\
Reza picked up the game smoothly. \"I was surprised you didn\'t want the potatoes either,\" he said.\
\
The only thing on Estie\'s plate was a midget  sized dinner roll that was the only carb allowed on the \"high energy protein\" diet.\
\
The ticking muscle in Estie\'s jaw tocked. The hazy, vague look in her eyes was replaced by a red flush that crept up from her chest to her face. Reza plopped a load of greens on top of Estie\'s dinner roll. Old Girl expected her to throw the greens to the ground. Instead she gripped her fork and stabbed it into the back of Reza\'s  hand.

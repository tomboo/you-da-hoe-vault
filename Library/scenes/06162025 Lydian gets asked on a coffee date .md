06162025 Lydian gets asked on a coffee date

LYDIA SAID, ["]{dir="rtl"}ALL GUYS LIKE BLOW JOBS."

["]{dir="rtl"}That[']{dir="rtl"}s not for me to say." The boy--- he said his name was Lorenzo, yet another weird thing about him---wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t meet Lydia[']{dir="rtl"}s eyes. He took a drink of tap water and watched the kids at the Student Union salad bar loading their plates with hungry eyes.[']{dir="rtl"}

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re kidding, right?" Lydia was starting to wonder if she was losing her touch. ["]{dir="rtl"}Why not? Are you gay?\"

\"No. What makes you say that?\" Lorenzo looked genuinely curious, like she[']{dir="rtl"}d called him a circus animal or a giraffe.

He was frowning. Not with disgust, exactly, more he had a bad taste in his mouth. Like she\'d used the wrong fork or burped in public. ["]{dir="rtl"}Sex is for after you\'re married."

["]{dir="rtl"}Now you really are fucking with me," she said.

["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}m not," he protested. ["]{dir="rtl"}And it[']{dir="rtl"}s better that than selling myself short,"

\"I\'m not getting this. Your parents kicked you out of your house for being a threat to \-- what\'d you call him \-- Prophet Joseph?\"

\"Deacon. Deacon Joseph,"Lorenzo said.

\"What the fuck do you care about following Mormon rules? You said your Mormon family kicked you out. Why would you follow some stupid Church rules when it was the Church who broke their own rules?\"

\"You don[']{dir="rtl"}t understand. You weren\'t brought up that way.\"

It occurred to Lydia that she hadn\'t exactly been brought up believing it was her God-given duty to put every cock she encountered in her mouth. It had always just seemed like a way to be get to know someone, kind of like sharing a sandwich or drinking from the same straw. Guys liked it. Ergo, Lydia liked it. Especially because it made her feel both powerful and important. What was a little sperm juice on her chin compared to the knowledge that she was the one with superhuman powers that could make someone fly?

Lorenzo was already gathering up his notebooks and a dog-eared copy of Plato\'s Republic.

\"Oh, yso ou like history?\" Lydia nodded at the book on top.

["]{dir="rtl"}It\'s philosophy,\" he said.

["]{dir="rtl"}Oh." She felt stupid. ["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}m only taking a few classes. English. American History."

He touched a springy curl that had come loose from her headband and tucked it behind her ear. It was such a light and tender touch it made her blink. He[']{dir="rtl"}d just refused her offer of a blowjob and now he was touching her?

\"Maybe we could have a coffee on Thursday,\" he said. \"Will you be here?\"

Knock me down with a toothpick. This guy turns me down and now he[']{dir="rtl"}s asking me on a date? \"I have English lit right before this."

\"See you then?\"

She felt a little at sea. She wasn\'t sure she\'d ever been on a coffee date. She was so used to going right to the main event. Then her heart lifted with an unexpected feeling of lightness. No need to perform? That was different.

["]{dir="rtl"}OK," she said. She raised the volume of her voice because he was already passing the salad bar. \"I\'ll be here.\"

She went outside to the stop sign to wait for the van. She was 5 minutes late, which was early for someone who held the Inner Horizons record for late penalties in the dozens.

She didn\'t feel the cold of the biting breeze off the frozen lake. A coffee date. What do you wear to a coffee date? She usually started with her underwear and matched whatever she word to the color of her bra and panties first. If you weren[']{dir="rtl"}t matching an outfit to La Perla lingerie, did that mean she could mix polka dots and plaids?

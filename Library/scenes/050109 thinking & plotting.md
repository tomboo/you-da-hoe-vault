'04/2809 Dramatic Events

Somebody starts a fire

An eviscerated bird is found in one of the boys' beds

Toward spring, a nutcase robin starts throwing itself at a window

One of them runs away

A mentor or therapist gets fired

**Really wild**

There's a stabbing. A fight breaks out between two of the boys

Or there's a cat fight between old Girl and another girl, lots of hair pulling, screaming, biting, nail scratching

Sickness spreads there the group like a plague: someone is screwing with the water, they're on a well and somebody threw something into the well to contaminate it.

Mean shit: two girls gang up on Rachel and torment her. Leia and fat girl Deanna, both wanting what Rachel has?

Rachel retaliates by cutting the labels out of Leia's designer clothes. If she had a Sears label, she'd sew it in place just to drive her nuts

They're on a boating outing around Lake Coeur D' Alene and someone falls or is pushed or jumps out, Lots of candidates for jumping. O. G. could be pulled to the water and try her best to resist. Somebody could fall in and while the boat turns back and gets close to the person in the water, O. G. could jump in to rescue them or maybe James, a great swimmer, Mr. Malibu surfer, could jump in and se shocked by the cold.

I have back story or character knowledge for O. G. and James and Leia. Rachel is a blank.

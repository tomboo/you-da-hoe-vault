AFTER HIS WIFE, ALMA, LEFT HIM for a horse whisperer, Dr. August Sanders Hazey often found himself staring at the black and white photo on his office wall. The portrait, inherited from a German uncle, was taken in the early 20^th^ Century. It showed three farmers dressed up on their way to a party. He wished he could go with them.

A neat stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical insurance premiums had to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the sour but ambitious head therapist, remained unread and unsigned.

Dr. Hazey checked the clock again.

Another hour before he could reasonably down another muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck, for his session with Rahel Bronfmann nee---What? The Grosse Point heiress to the Bronfman alcohol fortune had divorced, remarried and then divorced again in the year and a half since Lydia Bronfmann came to the program. How the woman remembered her own name was a mystery.

His plan was to assure Rahel about Lydia's Bronfmann's progress, which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl, a cutter and a bulimic, had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. Lydia had four write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct. The rest of her file was stuffed with carefully coded phrases: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (i.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening (keeping her under lock-and-key worked, up to a point). "Recommend single room" (can't get along with Estie Lattimer, the roommate).

What he could say definitively about Lydia Bronfmann was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were never late.

Parents like Rahel Bronfmann nee \_\_\_? came to Dr. Hazey to be reassured. He'd tried passing off this duty to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist, but Darlene had a problem with brutal honesty. She had no idea how to be reassuring without outright lying. When parents met with Darlene, she of the dour and acerbic personality, there went another monthly check that should have been made out to Inner Horizons and ended up being written to the new Anorexia Unit at Harvar'd McLain or Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu. Lucky patients there got to surf. God, it was a dog-eat-dog-with-anxieties-world.

Hazey had long ago mastered the trick of hitting the right balance between avuncular reassurance and bypassing the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact almost every adolescent he'd ever met toyed with sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

By the time Rahel Bronfman Fiat (soon to be ex-Fiat, according to Lydia) sailed into Dr. Hazey's office, she was thirty minutes late. She waved a vaguely dismissive hand at him, simultaneously air-kissing Lydia on both cheeks. It flashed through Hazey's mind that perhaps the girl's mother missed her cheeks by an inch because she really couldn't see that she was sitting on her hands on the couch.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A flutter of one impeccably made-up eyelid communicated that Rahel hated Lydia's mop of short black curls. Lydia had stopped straightening her hair soon after filing a formal complaint that she couldn't find a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "It's so... informal." Rahel's low voice had the Detroit scrubbed out of it by a voice coach.

The mother smiled at her daughter holding her delicate nose a touch too high. From the grim expression on Lydia's face, the girl seemed to be thinking about shoving Rahel's false eyelashes up her cosmetically enhanced nostrils. She had two of them, didn't she? Two roads to hell --- that's how Lydia would think.

Rahel was petite and dark-haired, a perfect clone of her daughter or, Hazey supposed, vice versa. Lydia, perched as far as she could get from her mother, shared her tiny bones but she was rounded in a childlike way while her mother looked wiry and lean without an ounce of softness. It looked like Rahel's workout routine was more military than the Marines.

Lydia's mother's first concern was whether her daughter had put on any weight. "Lydia has a tendency to fat, like I do," Mrs. Bronfmann said, patting a haunch as flat as a Greyhound's.

Rahel laid a hand on Hazey's arm---he'd made the mistake of pulling his wing back chair close to her---and he felt like a cream puff awaiting her sharp teeth. "I hope you're helping my little girl," she said. "Lydia's all I have."

"Rahel," Lydia said, "Dr. Hazey isn't my therapist. That's not his area."

Rahel looked surprised. "You're not being treated by the Head of the Program? Is that what you're saying?"

"I asked for a woman therapist," Lydia said. "You know. Because we get along so well." To this enigmatic statement, she gave Rahel a bland and sugar-sweet smile.

Hooboy.

When Hazey tried to probe gently about why Rahel didn't join the weekly calls for Lydia's family therapy, she said airily, "I've been out of the country" as if phones and Skype were yet to be invented.

"Even young adults can feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their therapy," Dr. Hazey said carefully.

"Did she say something about me?" Rachel cried. "I'm a good mother!"

Hazey took the hint and smoothly deflected Rahel by saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfmann---your father? --- is the paternal figure in Lydia's life." Clearly, the key lifetime issue between mother and daughter wasn't going to be solved in a 45-minute conversation between Lear Jet refuelings.

"It's so good you're here. Lydia was very surprised when we told her about your visit," Hazey said. This was code for Lydia's crying jag and refusal to meet with her mother until she extorted an art class at NICC out of Inner Horizons, though she hadn't earned that level of freedom. "Would you two like some time to yourself? I can step out of the room."

Both Rahel and Lydia looked at Hazey like he was nuts. "No" Lydia cried, at the same time as Rahel stood and said gaily, "No, no! I'm only here to say hello and drop off Lydia's birthday present. You know she just turned 18 this week."

"Last week," Lydia said. "Mom and I have birthdays in the same month." Lydia smiled another Saccharine smile, adding, "Only now Mom is 17 and I'm older than she is. It's a trick she has of making her birthdays run backwards."

The conversation went down hill after that.

Less than twenty minutes after the start of the meeting, the clack of Rahel's departing heels jackhammered in Hazey's overloaded brain. God, he needed that muscle relaxant. He absolutely mustn't. He had to control himself. He had to absolutely, positively stay awake for his four o'clock appointment with Old Girl.

Hazey called Darlene and told her about the disastrous encounter with Lydia's mother. His next-in-command had the job of triage. Then he lay back in his reclining chair and contemplated his corner office. Hazey had hung two of his favorite photos on the north wall, away from the sun, where he could look at them when he was in session or talking on the phone at his desk.

A young man weighed down by an enormous load of bricks faced him. The bricks were triple and quadruple stacked on a piece of plywood. Did they even have plywood then? Hazey had no idea, so maybe it was a thin, planed board. It looked like the camera had picked up the minute vibration of the weight on the man's shoulders, as if he was straining to hold up the load while the shutter pulsed. Hazey felt a communal sense of burden every time he looked at his debt load on his balance sheet.

The man's expression was polite and patient; Hazey had the sense he was waiting for the person behind the shutter to be done so he could carry the bricks up the ladder and go back for another load. Maybe he should buy the farm house out beyond the dump that Marvin Oppenheimer, his real estate agent, had shown him last week. He focused on the brick, that minuscule multiple exposure of the moving weight and thought maybe not. If you piled one more brick on, would it topple his load?

He let his eye move on to the restful scene of three natty young men in dapper dark suits and creased hats. They were leaning on rough walking sticks in the middle of a country road, the dark hills of dusk in the distance. He'd looked up the title of the photograph once--- Three Farmers on the Way to a Dance---so he knew they were dressed up for some village festivity. Three young men looking for girls to dance with? They were clearly at their ease, away from their farm work, dressed up, with their pants clean and pressed and fashionable, except for their home made, hand-carved walking sticks. It was just a moment, caught in the fading light of a fading day but the portrait had always held some kind of promise that Hazey liked. These idlers, they were on their way somewhere, the party they'd dressed so carefully for beckoning and yet they were politely waiting for the man behind the lens\--Hazey imagined him fiddling behind the hood of some giant box camera\-- waiting for him to be done with his business so they could go on to the dance. Hazey was always feeling the same way. When would his polite duties be done so he could get on with the party?

Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, the only regular patient he still saw was Old Girl. He'd had to drop all his other long-term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of the financial and administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections? So what if the therapists were required to review their clients' progress at the same time as Hazey reviewed cash flow and income projections? If the Program needed to make their numbers, what harm was there in holding a client back or requiring another quarter of income before the patient was judged healthy enough to be let go? It was just business, Hazey thought. Traditional psychiatric business practice no worse than stock trading at the end of the month or whatever.

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her. He supposed Lydia Bronfmann would be amazed that he felt the same way about her. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep Old Girl on his crowded schedule though it was hell on his calendar to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include the only patient who made him laugh. Old Girl often surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. If he didn't get through to her, he was afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to jolt the girl out of her suicide ideation.

She seemed to be tolerating a new cocktail of antidepressants but suicide had been a part of her identity so long, he couldn't seem to break her preoccupation with death. It was as if she'd been on the path to her own destruction for so long that walls had built up over her head until the rut she walked was deeper than granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair, even the stars above her were hidden.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit heel. He was also lazy. And unproductive. And he really, really wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for a pick-me-up because he was a professional and he did care, even he mostly didn't act like it.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. He couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a healthy, attractive young woman would wear wooly scraps of hair like a rag bag mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with ten weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her sexuality. She buried it in unisex clothing and let her hair mat into desiccated snakes.

Didn't she want a boy friend?

Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horizons from becoming a bed-hopping swap fest. But maybe he should make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way to celebrate life than to have sex with one of her peers? That boy from Malibu---Justin? Jamison? James?---he was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing a woman with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a reason for the Inner Horizon rules against fraternization between the sexes. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at NICC now that she had finished the Intensive program and was permitted to take 10 hours of community college classes. If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought.

The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the Atavan.

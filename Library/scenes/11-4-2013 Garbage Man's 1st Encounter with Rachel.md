Garbage Man\'s 1^st^ Encounter with Rachel

Nine o\'clock. Cold as a witches tip in fucking January. He\'s moving fast, rolling a garbage can on its end, dragging it to the truck bed, grunting when he lifts the overfilled can and dumps it in the truck bed. Sometimes he wishes he had a lift, like the town garbage hawler pansies, who don\'t have to do anything but heft a can onto a lip and the hydraulics do all the work.

He takes off his leathery glove to wipe the sweat out of his eyes. Fucking pansies. Too lazy to do the \_\_\_ and jerk with the big metal cans when he\'s able to lift 70-100 pounds up over his head. Shoulder aches today. Can\'t remember if he slept on it funny. Can\'t remember if he slept now that he thinks about it. All he remembers is imagining white tits and pink pussy every time he rouses and looks at the moon.

His last can is over by the fence turned over on its side. Coyotes, he thinks, seeing the strewn chicken bones and clumps of mash that have been dragged away from the opened tins and crumpled newspaper on the ground. He scoops methodically pushing the spills back into the can and chanting, \"Cunt, cocksucker, twat,\" like a song under his breath.

How much they throw away here at the crazy house. Every grapefruit half with only a bite taken out of it is like a message, \"They don\'t give a shit what they waste because they don\'t have to. Cunt. Fucking twats.\"

\"Hey, I forgot to put this out last night.\"

He\'s muttering his favorite swear words and all he registers is \"out last night\" before he sees a vision in goose bumps and shirt barely covering her ass.

\"Huh?\" He stops in mid-swing, the can lifted to his chest.

A blond girl, long, whisky colored hair framing her face, is gesturing to him with a small kitchen-size tub of garbage.

He sets the can down. Angles his head at the open and reeking \_\_\_\_\_\_ bed. \"There,\" he grunts. His eyes are riveted on the twin points of softly moving flesh under the tee shirt. The movement over the cloth a mysterious point at the \_\_\_\_ of a soft curve of flesh. He legs are purpled with gooseberries in the cold. Her feet are stuffed in running shoes, the laces flapping in the snow.

\"Thanks,\" she says, a nod to him that reminds him of polite behavior practiced by some part of the world he\'s never been part of.

He can\'t help himself. He watches the curve of her cheeks as she hurries back to the side door where the sleeping rooms are. The flow, like \_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ of muscle and promise.

Night of the Fire with Garbage Man Watching

He liked the jacket. It was black with official looking reflective tape on the sleeves and chest and bottom part. He looked bad ass in it. Big and bad ass. When he got some extra cash \-- maybe somebody would buy the Mustang parts he\'d been squirreling away \-- he wanted to buy the pants to go with the jacket. Nobody would mistake him for a candy ass garbage handler, no longer just Rusty Harrow, the dump man, but Rusty Harrow, the firefighter even if he didn\'t get paid to come out in the bitter cold at all hours like tonight where 20 or so kids were milling drawn out of the crazy house draped in blankets and talking a mile a minute as the experienced guys climbed up on the roof and inspected it for possible \_\_\_\_\_ of the fire.

This was funny, knowing as he did that he\'d first lit the dryer fluff that had been collecting in the overused dryer because the fucked up rich kids were too lazy to clean the lint trap.

He thought about the satisfying lick of flame that traveled from his match deeper in the bowels of the mansion where cotton clumps had mounted up like cancerous tumors in the dryer\'s innards. Lots of fuel in there he thought, just to make sure he\'d given the Rayon curtains that hung next to the window an extra lick of the flame.

He\'d driven half a mile from the nut house and parked in the heated running truck until the buzzer in his volunteer fire belt sounded its gravelly call. He\'d prepared himself to say to Daly, the Fire Chief on duty, that he\'d been on his way home which everybody knew was 5 miles past the nutso\'s on County 51 before they decided putting a dump next to the Coeur d\'Alene River was not such a hot idea. But Daly hadn\'t looked at him twice when he showed up right on time. Just said, \"You. Set up the perimeter line. Keep all them kids back and out from under foot.\" Daly had to have noticed the new jacket but the son-of-a-bitch kept his green eyes to himself.

He marched up and \_\_\_- the fire tape like a man in charge. When he spotted the blond girl being handed a blanket by Marty Oldstead, he wanted to hick him in the nuts. Why hadn\'t he thought to bring the horse blanket he\'d just liberated from Rawling Stable on his last pick-up and wrapped it around her self? Fucking nimshitz he called himself. Fucking turd.

He drifted closer to the knot of kids stamping their feet and rubbing their hands \_\_\_ the cold. His girl, the towsly-haired one with the long legs and big tits, was still at the edge of the group. A tall kid was standing next to her, his arm around her shoulders, as Russ had to get a hole on himself so he didn\'t walk up and stiff arm the asshole away from her. Get your hands off! he wanted to shout. Luckily, Rachel looked his direction and gave him an uncertain nod, a faint glimmer of recognition in her eyes, he thought. She remembers me! he tells himself and his heart fills with a weird sense of warmth he doesn\'t recognize the feeling coming upon him with the suddenness of being abducted. She remembers!

OLD GIRL'S BOOTS CRUNCH ALONG for the first few miles on her escape from Healing House.

Strenger Road had been snowplowed a few hours before. A light dusting of snow, just an inch or two, covers the churned ruts. As far as Old Girl can see, a silver ribbon of white snakes through dark trees and rolling hills pointing her way to Highway 95. To freedom. A few inches of newly fallen snow over the plowed surface looks deceptively smooth. Underneath, though, she feels her boots crunch through stiff snow muck and hard crust that covers a layer of ice slick enough to skate on.

Every few steps, even on the first mile of flats, one or the other boot slides out from under her. She finds herself constantly flailing and windmilling to stay upright. By the second mile, she perfects a kind of sliding gait. It involves stepping and gliding and making sure not to pick up her heels. As long as she stays connected to the surface, gravity can't take over.

She's descending the steep hill that the locals call Harrowing Hill when gravity wins. She falls painfully hard when she's about halfway down. She'd abandoned the skating stride in favor of duckwalking the steep slope with small mincing steps while she fights the slickness under the hard pack. One boot whips out from under her and the next thing she knows, she's lying turtled on her Hello Kitty back pack.

For a moment, she lies flat on her back in the empty road. Her brain rings like an alarm clock waking her up to pain. A milky wash of stars overhead shines bright as fireflies and the shrillness of the starlight hurts her eyes. Under the throb in her skull and the ache of a banged elbow, the ice under her body is freezing cold, unforgiving and chill as granite. She thinks longingly of her bed back at Healing House, of the soft flannel sheets, and thick woolen blankets. She's wishing she was still curled up in them, listening to Rachel breathe in soft susurrations in the bed across from her. She doesn't like to admit it, but she has grown to like the sound of another human in the darkness. Knowing she's not separated from the world of the living and alone, feels good.

At this rate, it will take her another hour, maybe two, to get to Highway 95 where she has a tiny chance of hitching a ride to I-90. She'll have to hope she can catch one of the big trucks hauling loads to Seattle. She feels like crying because she's hurt and she's cold. She's so tired. Mortally tired.

That's when she the low rumble of an approaching engine reaches her ears. It's distant and quite far away. It's coming from from the direction of the dump which is odd because there's nothing past the dump except Healing House.

The ruts in her mind take their usual leap away from the trouble it takes to stay alive and they take their wellborn path to the quickest and easiest way to die.

She shrugs quickly out of her pack and dumps it in the road. She half slips, half-slides down the hill to a blue-dark shadow near the bottom where a small grove of tall Ponderosas loom. He won't see me there, she thinks. Then she amends that thought to, even if he sees me, he won't be able to stop.

The engine rumble grows louder but it seems to take forever once she lies flat in the road. She positions herself so she crosses both lanes in order to make herself a bigger target. The thrum of the engine and the chatter of road noise rises and she hears a growl like a predator when a cone of brightness crests the hill. Even a blind man can't miss me, she thinks, as her own eyes are blinded by white. For the briefest instant, she has the impression that the light is sweeping back and forth like a trouble light in a cold breeze.

The night abruptly turns black. Old Girl senses more than sees a dark, speeding mass whoosh past her feet. A frigid gust of wind like an enormous wave crashes over her. The dark shape hurtles so close to her, she she takes in engine heat and diesel and rot.

A tremendous crash splits the night.

A metallic creak and whang.

The high pitched tinkle of breaking glass.

Old Girl brushes at her face in astonishment. She wipes away shards of ice and wetnes and road grit grit as if someone has throw a shovelful of slush in her face. She sits up, while her eyes take a moment to adjust from the burst of brightness back to the dim silver light. Inches from the soles of her boots is a huge tire tread of pushed up, granulated snow. The tread swerves past her and follows the slope a few feet, before it angles along the gutter of the mounded snow berm left by the plow. It follows the snow berm on a straight unerring path till it reaches the bottom and disappears in a grove of shadowy trees. A single tread? What happened to the other tire?

She is up and on her feet, slipping and sliding down hill, smelling a strong sweetish smell of caramel which releases when you peel a puzzle shaped piece of bark from a Ponderosa pine. She has to clamber and stagger up and over the plowed snow mound and follow a swerving path of two wheeled destruction and mangled branches before she finds the site of the crash.

She stands agape, disbelieving what her mind is telling her eyes to believe.

A large, still churning and humming truck is trying to drive up one the Ponderosas on a direct path, it seems, to the stars.

The truck stands vertically on its back end, its bed and tail gate embedded in the snow. Rear wheels churn and smoke, throwing up snow and spitting slush. The pine has been split nearly in half and the broken part of it stabs the sky with bent spars of yellow heart wood. The truck leans its weight on the tree, front wheels spinning without friction on either side of the trunk.

As Old Girl gapes, the truck begins a slow lean--- the headlights shining up into a a dark canopy of branches rakes the adjoining forest--- and then the chassis slips in a kind of walking slide a short distance around the trunk and whumpfs over on its side with a bang. Springs whinge, then creak. A sigh.

As if to signal that the impossible trip to the sky is over, the engine quits.

All is silence while a small explosion of free snowflakes swirl in front of the headlamps.

Old Girl fights and plunges through deep snow trying to get to the passenger side door. Since the truck lies on its side, the door is on top of the truck so she has to climb up finding toe holds in the undercarriage where she can. All she can see through the side window is a dark hunched human form leaning forward with arms protectively hugging the steering wheel.

No luck yanking the bent door open.

The glass of the windshield is cracked and crazed but still holding together. She crawls over the mashed hood and starts kicking at the broken glass using the heels of her boots to break out the shards clinging to the rubber molding like jagged icicles.

"Are you hurt? Can you talk?" she calls through the enlarging hole. She smells gas. Some unidentifiable reek. It takes a lot of work to kick a hole in the glass big enough to crawl through and she brushes at the glass with her gloves and pokes with her elbows trying to clear an entrance. Finally she just wiggles into the jagged hole using her boot to kick aside the glass. A gymnastic eel turn and shimmy deposits her in the front seat that has become a weirdly narrow space between the dashboard and the rear of the cab.

Litter covers everything. Paper bags. A tangle of ropes. Hamburger wrappers. Old McDonalds French fry cartons. Styrofoam cups. Hammers and a screwdriver. Rolls of duct tape. Some weird half doll half monster toy on the floor.

It takes her a minute to understand why the space is so cramped. The engine, normally under the hood, has been driven forward into the cab and the steering column is resting in the chest of the driver. The man isn't hugging the steering wheel. He\'s leaning forward, his arms wrapped around the column, because it\'s embedded in his chest.

\"Holy shit.\" She breathes in the wet penny smell of blood. Takes in the dark jacket with neon sleeves and hem that glow faintly in the reflected light of an ancient dash. To her astonishment, the driver opens dark eyes and he turns his face towards her. He\'s looking at her with a puzzled expression.

\"Are you hurt?\" she ask again. The absurdity of the question\--for Christ\'s sake the steering column is sticking into his chest!---propels her into feeling around his chest cavity to see if she's mistaken.

A dark, black stickiness clings to her fingers. It\'s coming from the steering wheel. Engine fluid? Oil? Lubricant? One headlight stares crazily out at the forest and reflects enough light into the cab to reveal the the man\'s face, his bleeding nose. Black greasy hair frames a questioning expression.

\"Who are you? he wants to know.

For the first time since she entered treatment, Old Girl answers without thinking. "Angela. My name is Angela." What's the point of going into the chapter and verse with a mortally injured man about a stupid nickname?

"Pretty," he says, his voice raspy and faint.

The man is filthy. He's maybe in his late forties, with an unshaven face and dark hair that's stiff with grease. A gash near his temple drips red and he wipes at his nose which is dripping in his lap. He waves his hand vaguely at the steering column. "Stuck,\" he says. "I can't move.\"

It dawns on Old Girl then that the dark flow that is dripping quietly on the floor mat is coming from the man's chest not the steering column. "I should go and get help," she says.

She has a desperate desire to scramble out of the truck, away from an injury she has no idea how to deal with, but honestly, the only help she can think of is too far away at Healing House. It'll take her hours he doesn't have to make it there and back.

Besides, he is already gripping her hand between his dark, wet fingers. For a man with a steering column embedded in his chest, he\'s got a grip like a tree root strong enough to break stone. \"I\'m scared," he says, his expression intense with longing. "Don't leave me."

"You have to stay awake. Keep your eyes open." Old Girl is thinking about something she read somewhere about not allowing a person with a concussion to fall asleep, a useless fact that\'s stuck in her head with a lot of other useless information that doesn't include even the basics of first aid. She tries not to count the black beads that are dripping down the steering column like ticks of a clock.

\"I didn\'t do nothing," he murmurs into the silence. "It's not fair." Old Girl nods, in complete agreement. Life isn\'t fair. She doesn't have a steering column sticking out of her chest, for example, when she's the one who offered her body up in the middle of a snowy road expecting death to find her. Instead, death circles this unattractive, stinking man so close she can almost feel its wings.

"Shhhh." Old Girl squeezes his hand gently, then tries to count his thready pulse. Is it multiply by 6 for 10 seconds or is it count the beats for 10 seconds and divide by 6? She gives up because even an idiot can tell that his pulse is racing like a clock that's off its rocker. She\'s watching the drops that continue to drip from the column bead and it doesn't take long for them to hang for longer and longer pauses before they hit the floor. \"Who knew that he hath so much blood in him." Macbeth comes to her with the voice of doom. Now she wishes she\'d paid more attention in school, especially in First Aid and Home Accident Prevention that Aung Peggy insisted she take. Now she\'s not sure that even if she had paid attention that the instructions would have covered a man who is bleeding to death while holding her hand with a death grip. About the time it occurs to her it is a death grip, she perceives a relaxation of his fingers as if he\'s drifting off to sleep.

"Stay with me," she says and he responds by making an ineffectual movement to push at the steering column. He raises one shoulder, as if he's trying to be philosophical, and says, "What are you going to do about it?" He closes his eyes as if he doesn't expect her to answer.

The last thing he says, after brushing restlessly at his chest, is, "Always rain. Never any goddamned sun."

The tick of a cooling engine. A cold breeze with a few snow flakes riffles through his hair. A rasp of dry wheat chaff exits his laboring lungs.

Something feels enormous.

Ever after she will remember this moment, her first experience in the presence of death. The only time that will come close to the enormity of this feeling is many years later, during the birth of a baby that is so far from conception that it might well be one of the stars scattered like diamond dust across the night-black sky.

His breathing changes from quick and raspy to a long wheezing inhalation with an interminable silence before his mouth opens to breathe again. She realizes that he is no longer gripping her in fear and terror that she will leave. Somehow she is the one gripping him.

She is doing her best to keep him tethered to this earth, though her strong and youthful grip is weak and paltry in the face of the force that pulls at him.

Would she have hung around for Mom and Dad? Gabe? Absolutely, she thinks, if it would have kept them alive. What about David and Peggy, the people who stepped up after death erased her family and folded her into their lives without question? Does she owe them some connection to this earth?

The weird thing, she realizes, about this small, encapsulated world in the greasy man's truck is how anchored she feels to it. He needs her. He wants her to stay. For perhaps the first time in her life, she herself wants---feels duty-bound, in fact\-- to stay to hold onto another human being. It is a revelation among the hamburger wrappers and Chicken McNuggets and French fry cartons, all the throwaways that have sustained this stranger's throwaway life, to realize she can't bear to have his life\--or hers \--be thrown away now.

His eyes are closed. His jaw opens and closes twice like a fish without water then opens one last time. His color, when she climbed in the windshield, was ruddy with life. Now his lips are thinned and pale. He's dusky blue at the tip of his nose. The black stubble on his cheeks looks even blacker.

A light wind riffles the papers on the dash. Goose bumps pass over his neck and chest, then his face turns dusky all over, gray and dull as salted snow.

For all her longing for death since she was ten years old, she\'s never seen it. In the moment of recognition that the power has switched off, she holds tight to the man's hand, willing the warmth of her own blood and life into his relaxing fingers. A sudden vast longing steals over her. She would give anything to turn back the hands of the clock, to turn back to the moment when his eyes greeted her with surprise when she entered the cab and gleamed at her with flinty life.

It is easier this time to back out of the cab feet first, reversing her direction from the way she came in, as if she\'s squirming out of a birth canal. She kick-steps a trail up the mounded snow berm and makes her way back to the road toward Highway 95 feeling new blood pulsing in her feet, the pain like ice crystals tumbling and tearing her veins.

The silver snow light seems colder. A few snow flakes sift down from pine branches scattered by the crash.

A strange half human-half crab monster she found on the floor of the cab nestles in her pack. It has a shaving brush for a head with large goggle eyes mounted to the handle but no mouth. A unicorn-sharp shell is glued on a penis. Its arms are mismatched doll parts, one brown, the other pink, while its bottom half, naked as a newborn, has claws for legs. She wonders if she can sell it but who would be crazy enough to buy it?

Her plan is to thumb a ride on Highway 95 which will take her to I-90, then hitch to Seattle, where she intends to ask Eleanor, her dad's sister, now a professor in literature at the University of Washington, to help her get back on her feet.

She's wanted to die for so long, it is hard to imagine what it will take to direct her life toward the problems of living. Instead of blowing her nose and wishing she could blow her brains out, she now has to think about buying Kleenex. Life was plenty complicated when all she was thinking about was a rifle for getting rid of postnasal drip. Maybe the truck driver who picks her up will have a booger box hidden between the seats so she can blow her nose. Or maybe she should use her sleeve. Maybe she should just stop by a 7 Eleven and grab some napkins.

A whole world of possibilities opens up when you are thinking about how to live your life instead of ending it, she thinks.

Meanwhile, Angela begins to trudge along, seeing dawn lifting the blackness from the night sky and turning it to an intense night blue. She feels life, painful and biting, rush in to her frozen toes.

PETER: IS THIS THE ENDING? *I added two Hazey segments but couldn't figure out how to include them because of the timing (all scenes in Tomorrow/last part move in chronological order so reader isn't thrown around in time.*

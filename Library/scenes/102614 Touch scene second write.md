102614 Touch scene second write

There was comfort in leaning into the big woman. Old Girl had a weird flash, an image really, of a big hearth, one of those walk-in things she saw once in an ancient stone house. That was how Margaret heated her in her big red plaid flannel shirt over her capacious ass. The woman was as big as an oil furnace and it felt unbelievably good to just let herself be surrounded by warmth.

Old Girl had been sleeping and waking most of the day until the sound of a distant siren disturbed her. All day, she'd been alternating between chills and fever and the siren sent her deeper into a deep freeze. She burrowed deeper beneath flannel sheets weighted down by three wool blankets and came awake with her teeth clacking together.

In her tumbled, fever-and-chill-fueled dreams, a far off siren howled like a hungry baby. The constant mwah-mwah-mwah sound snaked under the blankets bringing with it a chill like an ache deep in her bones. The sound kept getting louder till it sounded like it was in the dorm room with her. Finally, she clawed her way out of the bed clothes so she could pop an eye through the broken blind. She wasn't dreaming. A giant red fire truck inexplicably parked across the driveway.

Abruptly the siren snuffed out mid-yowl like someone had smothered the dream baby mid-cry.

Feeling week as a kitten, she herked the top Pendleton blanket off the bed and wrapped it around her shoulders Indian-style. By the time she crept the length of the hall, firefighters in blue and neon-striped uniforms were boiling through the entryway.

All she could think in her addled state was that the arsonist was back. She couldn't smell anything through her clotted sinuses. What was on fire? Why weren't the firefighters evacuating people out of the building?

A sound of blubbering came from the living room. Margaret's voice repeating, "I tried, I tried, I tried..." merged with the odd sight of large-and-in-charge Margaret leaning into the arms of a burly and bearded firefighter who was stolidly patting her back.

"I couldn't\--! I tried to! He was already gone..." she was saying.

"How long did you do compressions?" asked the fireman.

"Twenty minutes? Maybe twenty-five? I called 9-1-1, then started CPR."

Behind Margaret, two firefighters were pulling a white sack thing up and over a pair of skinny legs. Black and white Addidas-clad feet, then black hipster jeans, then a Bard College sweatshirt disappeared in the stuff sack . She caught only a glimpse of a white angular face with a scruffy beard -- nobody she knew---before a female firefighter expertly tied a half-hitch on top of what had to be somebody's head. A body bag? She'd witnessed some weird stuff on the plaid couch that was front and center in all kinds of peer group shit, but this was the weirdest.

She let out an inadvertent moan. Margaret's head jerked up from the firefighter's shoulder. "Oh, honey, you shouldn't be out of bed!"

Margaret abandoned the firefighter who was eyeing her with interest, and made right for her. "Don't come in here. You don't need to see this," Margaret was saying but the white bag was already rolling past on a gurney like some mystery that would never be explained.

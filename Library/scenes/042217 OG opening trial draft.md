Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy when all you had to draw upon were the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Nine young adults between 17 and 20 years old --- "YAs," as the staff at Inner Horizons called them --- sauntered around her into the Healing House living room trying not to look like they were hurrying to get seated by 10 AM. Three couches had been shoved together to form their usual off-kilter circle. Big Paul, who had an obsession with even numbers, took up most of the love seat.

Darlene, the therapist on Monday duty, banged on the meditation gong. She set off a flurry of pushing and shaving to get a seat on the Rorschach couch with the black and rust blots. Nobody wanted to get stuck on the Jizz Couch, not since Lydia had been caught banging Alex, her therapist, on it.

Dani won the couch catfight by hip-checking Lydia and flopping into place before Lydia could displace her.

Lydia mouthed to Dani "Eat me" and stretched out full length on the rust plaid cushions, taking the entire sofa for herself. Why should Lydia care about sitting on the wet spot when the bodily fluids were mostly her own?

Welcome to Process Group. A a twice-weekly bitch fest held at Inner Horizons Treatment Center for Adolescents and Young Adults that was a witches brew of petty resentments and one-up-mans-ship and oversharing and drama marked by an occasional \"Language!\" from Darlene and all twelve therapists who took their turns at process duty.

Darlene said, "Demerit card to Dani, one to Lydia. See me after Process for paperwork."

Then, without taking a breath, she introduced the new black girl like a cheer leader. "Meet the newest member of the Inner Horizons team! Rachel Interlachen! Yay!"

Last night, Rachel, a tall willowy girl in her late teens had been frog-marched into Healing House by two ex-cops in matching ski jackets and T*rust in God, Buy a Gun* baseball caps. That meant Rachel's mom and dad had paid a bundle to have their darling daughter escorted to Idaho by personal guard to put her into treatment.

Rachel, who had very dark skin and a hollow face, hunched next to James. She wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." On one eggplant-colored wrists, Old Girl saw raised horizontal scars. Not vertical, she noted. Garden-variety self-injurer, just like Old Girl and most of the girls in the program.

Get prepared, newbie. Heads are going to whip around when you walk down a street in lily-white Coeur D\'Alene. The Aryan Nations headquarters is fifteen miles away at Hayden Lake and the only black people they want in Idaho are *Cops* show reruns. Get used to your nappy hair because they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll get close to will be in the hands of a skinny cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Old Girl turned her ottoman away from the group toward the front picture window and contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear on the eaves. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the longest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth that framed the yard. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

Today's curtain of snow cut off any hint of the massive Ponderosa pines that ringed the Healing House yard. Snow had started falling last October and was apparently going to keep on falling until May. Only dim sulfurous light was able to beat its way through the gloom.

Old Girl was eleven when she made her first suicide attempt. She had raided the medicine cabinet at her guardians' house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was that Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the universe along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed caplets and fish oil jammed the shelves, but Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's most embarrassing way to go?

At 17, after a year and a half in Adolescents, Old Girl now applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to kill herself. Nothing gross, for example. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor who thought someone had pushed her beyond the ropes---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water she expelled so hard that she burst a blood vessel in one eye ---all fluids were verboten. Double-ditto road rash, like the kind she got when she'd fallen out of Uncle David's Buick turning a corner on the way home from picking her up at middle school. Her body weight carried her out the unlatched door and she learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. It wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken arm and the harrowing experience of having gravel picked out of her hip with forceps.

Hanging? Definitely off the approved list. The big objection to asphyxiation was something she'd read about how your tongue swells up three times its normal size and then hangs out of your mouth like a brown banana. No thank you.

Her closest encounters with killing herself came in moments when life seemed boring or at least, partially under control. She wondered if her brain was being rewired while she was using it. She\'d be thinking a benign thought like "it\'s time to buy a new head for my electric toothbrush" and the next thing she knew she'd be sticking a fork in the outlet to see if she could fry.

All she could think, the only drumbeat in her head, was \"make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\" If the pain wouldn\'t stop on command, she stopped it herself by 1) opening the car door and letting her body drop or 2) opening the drug cabinet and reaching for any pill bottle that promised oblivion (Ex-Lax was an early mistake when she woke up in the hospital recovery room with the taste of charcoal in her mouth and the ignominy of shitting her brains out) or 3) by opening her wrist with a beer can opener and passing out from the sight of so much blood.

On days like today, when the drumbeat to die, die, die, subsided to an I, I, I of low level pain, she was able to do her homework and finish her chores at Healing House and go to therapy with Dr. Hazey without fantasizing about putting an end to herself. She just never knew when the need to really try it would hoodwink her out of daylight into perpetual night.

The guilt of watching Mom\'s and Dad\'s life insurance get eaten up by treatment fees, followed by the drain on Uncle David\'s and Aunt Peggy\'s savings, and their ban on family vacations and her awareness that no college money was being set aside for her cousins ate at her. What was wrong with her that she couldn\'t fix herself? Who was she to suck up money that was supposed to pay for trips to Disney World and fund her cousins\' chance at a better life?

If she wasn't alive, she wouldn\'t be responsible for \$120,000 of fees for her first year at Inner Horizons. Uncle David joked that they had already bought Dr. Hazey two new Mercedes or was it Range Rovers? Which one was more expensive for the good doctor\'s well-rounded butt?

It wasn't bad enough that she was ashamed that her paltry life dragged on and on when her mother\'s and father\'s and baby Gabe\'s lives had been deleted as easily as a backspace on a key board. Now she had the added guilt of fucking up Uncle David's and Aunt Peggy's and their kids to pile on.

Lydia was now telling the story of she'd coerced a police officer with a blowjob. The short black curls on her head bobbed enthusiastically on her slender neck. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene made a note. She flipped to a clean page on the clipboard. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist's shake up after Axel's departure.

Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved to Young Adults. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized founder Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from D-Day, shortened from Despair Day. A Yale degree in psychiatry on Hazey's wall said he specialized in Adolescents, probably because he still was one. The year 1986 showed up on some of the diplomas she read on his office wall one day when she was too wound up to sit through her session. That would mean Hazey had to be what... almost fifty? No wonder he was almost senile.

James Olson, the blonde, quiet surfer from Malibu, California, now had the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd said in one of those tense, shame-fests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get up. He was saying, "I traded my Revos for the candy," when Darlene wanted to know how he could afford Jelly Bellies on his \$5-a-week snack allowance.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high. Darlene wanted to know whom he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, his room mate and a meth-addict motor-mouth, had supplied the candy because Reza's New York Jets cap had the Revos hanging off the back of it. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. After three months without running away, Young Adults were allowed to take 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with his trade. At Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex. Ching-ching-ching. A galaxy of Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, another drip of moisture beaded up and rolled down the icicle to the edge of the eaves. It hung there as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions.

Time was elastic at Inner Horizons. You were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards if you fucked up. The clock ran forward for short periods but if you earned a demerit, say, for being late for Process Group or failing to take the trash out or you fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed, or you refused to participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during therapy, the clock would turn around and run backward and taunt you as it ran. Old Girl had bitter experienced heading toward a weekend recreational passes or once, a chance for a weeklong trip home to Aunt Peggy and Uncle David. Just a when she was close to getting on a plane, the crazy clock rewound and she found herself back at ground zero.

If she had known the clock was broken, she could have accepted it but the fact that the clock ran fast sometimes and slow at others and then took a god-awful leap backward to put her at zero over and over again made her hopeless with despair.

When Old Girl moved from Ads to YAs after New Years, she left her single room at Calm Cottage ---don't even get her started on the Program's stupid names---and moved into Healing House which was 15 miles from Couer d'Alene. The property bordered on the Kootenai National Forest. Next door on the other side was the dump.

She couldn't see any improvement in the level of maturity from Ads to YAs, unless she counted the fluency in psychobabble. The first thing new resident learned was to spout on like paid professionals about accountability and personal validation and developmental delays.

Healing House was also a lot more beat up than Calm Cottage. It was a one story ranch house. Old Girl assumed that was to prevent people from jumping. The living area separated two sleeping wings that angled away from each other. The wings were named for old Indian tribes: girls lived in the Flat Head; boys slept in the Black Feet wing. It took about one nanosecond for the wing names to devolve to the Fat Asses and the Black Heads. Somewhere in Dr. Hazey's small empire of repurposed residences around town, he had a manor home named for the Shoshones where the Show Ponies cavorted.

Naturally Fat Asses couldn't fraternize with Black Heads, and vice versa. Residents ate together, processed together, recreated together, and slept by themselves. God forbid you actually got close to anyone.

The wall thermometer outside read 28 degrees. An hour before, it was 23 degrees. Yippee! Idaho's definition of spring.

At breakfast, she'd overheard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the fix-it guy who picked up the trash whenever he felt like it. Margaret told him to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl, who was consumed by thoughts of suicide, that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery.

How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The insistence in Margaret's loud voice that morning made it seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who drove a rackety ancient truck that held double stacked rows of jouncing barrels. Maybe melting was the key. The icicle dripped moisture when it warmed up during the day, then refroze into lethal weapons at night.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her suicide attempts---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straight hair fan out like a sun storm in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process of dreads had squeezed the copper out of her hair. Now it looked dull as cardboard. Death would pale her freckles; she supposed. Would it also flatten her hooked nose?

Usually she covered her strange proportions with baggy jeans or dark shapeless sweats. Her long legs made her look like a stork with the heavy breast of a turkey. The Fedora hat she wore to look hip wasn't very practical when it was freezing. She would have to carry it in her backpack and wear the black, pilling ski hat with the earflaps until the last minute.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job.

Margaret would have to wield the scissors. Anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Lydia Bronfman was a cutter. She had lost the argument about who had to process first. She was also a nympho and bulimic and the only child from some famous beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the mid-west in her nasal singsong Accountability Letter for fucking Axel Friedman, her therapist. Everybody was mad at Lydia for getting Axel fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why Lydia was apologizing. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall since she had sex with everybody. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat alone in the corner, could count that high.

Lydia channeled Marilyn Monroe while she listed behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing in a breathy voice. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she said, playing to the audience. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody said."

Darlene rapped her clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

"How can I take ownership if I don't tell you what I did?" Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by diamond earrings the size of nickels.

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Dani earned a living as a nude dancer to spite her parents who were evangelicals. Lydia, trying to outdo Dani, babbled on. The two of them were so self-involved, so clueless about anyone else in the room, Old Girl wanted to choke them with the same rope. The problem was there was no rope at Inner Horizons. No rope, no long scarves, no ties for bathrobes, no leather to hold up a pair of pants (the boys whined about this incessantly). Nothing longer than a shoe lace and even those were kept under lock and key.

Old Girl looked down at lumpy bumpy laces tied a million times and felt a bad case of captive rage coming on. Captive rage was like captor rage, except more vicious. When you had captor rage, there was some dim glimmer of understanding that the night duty or day super or van driver was making \$8 bucks an hour and didn\'t want to be at Inner Horizons any more than you did. But when you got captive rage, all the blame was aimed at yourself.

Lydia had met Old Girl on her first day of lock up with the phrase, \"Welcome to You-Da-Ho.\"

Udahoe? Old Girl was stupid enough to ask.

\"No, You-Da-HO.\" Lydia emphasized the last syllable. \"You da crazy ho who fucked up by getting yourself locked up in bum-fuck Idaho with a bunch of crazy fuck-wads you\'ll never get away from.\"

At the time, she thought it was a lame ass joke until she realized it was so right on that the phrase turned into an ear worm she couldn\'t shake.

Old Girl was so tired. She had a hard time sleeping because her mind kept itself busy fabricating scenes of her death. She liked scenarios that were as plot driven as mysteries. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Miu-Miu dresses. Weather varied between dark and creep-meister or sometimes gray as grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she imagined a fishing boat that steamed on oblivious to a body falling out of the sky. Tragedy didn't always have to slap you in the face.

How warmer it had to get to make the icicle do its work? If she watched the temperature during Process Group twice a week and checked it before dinner every day, maybe she'd get an early read on the melting progress. Always the problem with real life. So little you could control.

"Old Girl, wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice, cut into her daydream. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle," Darlene said.

Old Girl didn\'t want to come back in the circle. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally wanted to be alone. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and vague murmurs to get well, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, the new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?" said Darlene.

She was reminded of the pleasures of double homicide-suicide as she swiveled dutifully back to the fringes of the group.

On the bright side, she added the number 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Time thinned until Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time seven more people processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism --- if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it--- and then it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged her to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

The curtain of streaming snow was now so thick it cut off any hint of the blue-black wall of fir trees that ringed the yard. The sun hung out there somewhere. Too weak and wan to do more than ooze sulfurous yellow light through the swirling flakes.

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced outside,then at the ceiling as if she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's failures had aged her. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled slowly backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

Could James feel the new girl\'s bolt of electricity like she could? It felt like she was being electrocuted by proxy and it scared her, this feeling of polar opposites connected. Her white hands gripped Rachels slim black upper arms with an iron grip. Underneath her fingrs she couldfeel bones as delicate as green tree limbs but pulsing with alien life.

The jolting and sparking was deeply unnerving. It made Old Girl want to run at the same time that her hands were stapled to Rachel\'s body in the act of being kidnapped by runaway life.

Jesus, she was thinking. Get me out of here!

From the stricken look in James blue eyes opposite her as he held on for dear life to her shins, she understood that he was feeling the same awe and horror and shame. James could no more disconnect tthan she could.

Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck. This girl needs us to hold her to this earth and I can barely hold myself here with everything I\'ve got.

Up to that moment, running had always been in Old Girl\'s mind as an fuzzy possibility. She was exactly like every other resident at Inner Horizons. She hated and loathed the Program and woke up every morning believing she couldn\'t stand it one more day, then woke the next morning and saw that she was still here. The constant psychobabble about self- actualization and self-denial and self-development and self-knowledge and self education and self-disgust made her acutely aware that the only way to save her sorry self was to run.

No more shilly-shallying. Run tonight.

Shilly-shallying\--where had that come from? Shilly-shallying was something her mother would have said if she wasn\'t now a greasy spot on the railroad tracks with Dad and baby Gabe after being shoved into a train by a geriatric driver who mistook his gas pedal for a brake. No shilly-shallying there.

The senior citizen had been going 45 miles per hour when he crashed into them from the rear and the train was going 50 when it hit them on the tracks and there was basically nothing left but gristle and bone when it came time to bury them. This from matter-of-fact Aunt Peggy who conveyed this nugget of information to her best friend when she thought Old Girl was out coldon the couch with a sedative the day after it happened.

She brought her attention back to Rachel\'s surprisingly firm biceps. Her eggplant colored hands thumped against the floor while her heels beat their own crazy tattoo even though James had a white-knuckled grip on her shins.

Shilly-shallying is over. Go now.

05312025 What OG learns by end of novel

How do we survive life when it's so hard? One day at a time, really. One second, one millisecond, --- and one small step--- at a time.

Life throws horrible shit every moment of every day. The people who live on are the ones who keep their values from flying apart in the shit storm and fling it back, even if it's only in a teaspoon.

You can always swim in the shit storm: drink too much Red Bull and vodka; take an double hit of Ecstasy; tell the easy lie --- "sure, you're gorgeous, honey, let me fuck you"--- or look the other way when someone so wasted they can't think is getting hit upon. But if you go with the flow of shit, you have to remember it always rolls down hill, so pretty soon --- like right now, for example, standing at the corner of \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in Spokane --- you're already rolling in it and gravity is not your friend.

If you stand firm when the shit starts going down, you will slip and slide; maybe, you will stumble and fall, but if you tip over and get back up, you'll zigzag out of the suck to firm ground and live to take a shower.

Every day we make fateful decisions. They just don't seem fateful, they appear small and inconsequently, like it's only \$5 you're lifting from Dad's wallet of \$500 bills but it's still shitty and moving in the down direction instead of the stand up one you want to aim for.

I am writing about kids at the time in their lives in their teens and young adulthood when they're teetering on the edge of the nest and trying to figure out if they can fly or crash into the stony ground. Everybody is given the opportunity to spread their wings. We all stumble or hop a little ways and have to reset before the wind current teaches you how to let the wind current level your wings and catch the updraft --- just that minute adjustment but an essential correction --- that will let you lift off, if only for a few feet. It's those little decisions --- saying you're sorry instead of blaming your neighbor, helping pick up the groceries that got knocked over, noticing that some dweeb at school is carrying a too-heavy load and hefting part of it because why not, you're there.

Old Girl, now Angela, as she's introduced herself to Glenn and Cammie, the husband and wife truck driver pair who are on their way to Seattle with a freezer of chicken tenders, saying "why not? There's plenty of room" learns the life lesson that nobody starts by running into a burning building.

You catch a whiff of smoke. Tap your brakes and slow. You're opening the window, then the car door, to look around for help. When you call 911 and don't see anybody , you're halfway to the door. That first step into the dim and smoky hall seems inevitable when you hear a baby's panicked wail. The cry in the dark isn't a decision, really. It's just a shove to keep moving because you've already been moving toward the right response since the smoke wound around your throat like a boat constrictor.

All life's trajectories are a series of tiny steps in the right direction. A small child, a 12-year-old, a teenager, a young adult running away from a treatment center to an aunt who barely knows her, and people who make it to old age eventually learn that once you're moving in the right direction all you have to do is go on unless you want the shitstorm to carry you away.

The first thing OG says when her feet hit the running board of the truck driven by a married truck-driver pair named Cammie and Louis , is "I'm Angela. I'm hoping I can hitch a ride west.2"

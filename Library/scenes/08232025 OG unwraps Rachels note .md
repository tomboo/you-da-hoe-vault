08232025 OG unwraps Rachels note

She unrolled the paper that Rachel wrapped around the bills. She counted the money first and didn't see that there was a note on the paper till she was tucking the bills in the hidden flap in the Snoopy hat.\
Oh, goddamn it, she thought when she read Rachel's last words. "You pinkie swore you would't off yourself tonight. Remember that tonight includes tomorrow morning."

Fucking shit. The sign she used to see in the Wallingford neighborhood on her school bus ride came to her. "Bananas on sale tomorrow." She used to think it was funny that the bananas were never on sale today; the good thing they promised was available only if you came back the next day.

Who gave a shit if she pinkie sword with a kindly but gullible roommate? She could lie down and take on nap on the road in the 10 degree wintry light if she wanted to. But the problem of the pinkie swear was that she had made a promise. Something she committed to truthfully before she knew what would happen later in the night.

If she wanted to kill herself, she should have gone to sleep in the cab with the dead man. The cab was hidden under the dark boughs of the Ponderosas surrounded by deep snow and dim violet shadows. Nobody would have found either of them until it was too late.

But now, right now, she was hopping on pins and needles that were poking both of her feet. She tried to wake the sludge in her feet that was burning and comfortable as life itself.

Goddamn it. She knew better than to befriend anybody because people always tried to tether you to this earth with invisible tiptoes that you found to be as unbreakable as the zip ties she had found in the cab and stashed in her pocket.

The zip tie she had found in the garbageman's hair was in her pocket. She had picked up 3-4 of the orange neon worms, wondering why he had so many of them floating everywhere int he cab.

Zip ties were scattered everywhere in the cab. Orange neon plastic that looked harmless when they weren't wrapped around your neck and being tightened.

The driver must have had some use for them. There were so many zip ties strewn on the dashboard and the floor. He even had one in his hair which she had removed after he took his last breath and put it in her pocket. She wasn't sure why.

That stupid pinkie swear and the weird appearance of the zip tie she needed to keep the money together. Sometimes the universe dropped things in your lap just when you needed them. Was that what Rachel's note and the tie were for? To keep her tied to this earth whenever she felt depression's bullying and lies that urged her to leave?

She shook herself out of her revery, thinking she was making too much out of both the pinkie swear and the appearance of the zip tie just when she realized she needed it. Sometimes things were just coincidences. Lucky coincidenceses, surely. Nothing to pay attention to because it was just coincidental, wasn't it?

010719 Paul closes apology scene with Reza and James

A tap-tap- ppppauuuuuse-RAP sounded on the door like a secret code. Reza opened it. Big Paul stood on the other side.

James expected Paul to want to play cards with him, which would have been preferable to staring at half a page of shit that he couldn't bear to see.

Instead, Paul said, "Hey, Reza, I wrote a new song. Want to hear it?"

Since when did Paul sing? The big autistic kid barely opened his mouth except to eat.

"So did I," Reza said, unexpectedly. Reza scrabbled backpack and pulled out a piece of barred paper with a treble and bass clef clearly visible in lines of notes.

"I thought you just wrote on the back of your eyeballs," James said.

Reza snorted. "My eyelids! That's where I work out my music. Then I write it downs o I remember it."

Reza closed the door on James just a little too loudly.

It was odd staring at the blank wood, hearing Reza ask Paul what key he was working in.

James felt strangely adrift. Apology extended. Not accepted. Reza off to pal around with the one guy in the Program who never spoke. There were no musical instruments at Healing House, so it was hard to imagine how those two were going to share the music they had written.

Apparently they could both play music on the back of their eyelids. Why did that make James feel so alone?

Reza was always playing music on the backs of his eyeballs. Apparently, Big Paul did it too. Were they going to reach each other's music and play it on the backs of their retinas? It sounded so odd---and frankly interesting -- that James was almost envious that he hadn't been invited. Hey, he could read music, not that he'd told Reza that. And why did that omission make him feel more alone? Who was Monkey Boy now, stuck in his room without a key board. He had eyeballs, but nothing to make them work.

James had no idea that Reza and Paul were friends. Occasionally, James played bridge or hearts with Paul. He was wicked smart and you played any card counting games at your peril.

His mind ranged back to that door knock -- the rhythmic dat-dat-pppaaause-RAP was like a secret handshake the two of them had worked out. Did Reza and Paul have more than music in common? Were they friends? Or was this some new pact in the constantly shifting alliances that were the Program's stock-in-trade? Reza was mad at James and he was striking out on his own to forge a new, maybe not so sycophantic relationship?

For an instant, James missed the little shit. Then he said, WTF, and dismissed the feeling of loneliness as bullshit. Reza had no life. James had no life. Why the hell would he want more time with him. He was glad Paul had relieved him of Reza's presence.

091516 Mother of Lydia visits

Lydia felt like she was stranded on a block of ice. She was waiting behind the shower curtain in the bathroom off the living room where James was supposed to be joining her for stand-up sex. Was he waiting for her to be carried off by wolves driven by the frigid wind she c drifting in through the window?

In two hours---one hour and 56 minutes, according to Grandpa Ben's birthday present of a Piaget watch ---Lydia's mother was going to wreak havoc on her fragile equilibrium. If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart.

She'd already checked her wallet to make sure the \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse during the epileptic fit was tucked away. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black nails and pay for a tasteful French manicure with perfect white crescents. The same manicure would cost her \$60 bucks on New York's upper East Side so for today, she supposed she was lucky to be in Idaho.

If she'd known Rahel was coming for a visit, she never would have gone Goth Girl.

She looked down at the faux oak veneer in the faux Shaker bathroom---even the toilet seat was blond oak---and made a note to herself to remember to stash her cheap-ass Betsey Johnson knock-off tote on her roommate Esty's side of the room. Her mother had a thing about fakes. "You and I know what's real," she liked to say, "unlike the rest of the world."

Even in authentic Jimmy Choos, Rahel was faster than Lydia in running shoes. A fitness fanatic, she kept herself tiny as a ferret and she was always harping after Lydia to lose weight. Gain two pounds and you committed social suicide on the Bronfman scale. What man would want you if you were fat?

The first thing Lydia planned to do after Rahel took off on her Lear jet was to run to down Dunkin' Donuts in downtown Coeur D'Alene and stuff herself with every cake donut and cream cruller on the shelf. She'd think of her mother looking at the clouds at thirty thousand feet as her daughter scarfed donut after donut until she couldn't stuff in another bite. Then Lydia would open her mouth wide and vomit everything she'd swallowed into the maw of the second hand purse her mother left behind for her birthday. That's what I think of your stinking present, Mom.

Just what in hell could be keeping James? She had to work hard to push the image of the new girl's epileptic shaking away. The blond ponytail humping against the hardwood. The sightless eyes rolled white. The strange uncoordinated shivering. Lydia's itch for sex, as relentless and bad as it was, was at least on the inside of Lydia's body with all the other horrible things she kept locked up in her. Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside of a petite and perfectly maintained body. A small mercy. But at least she didn't have to wear her ugliness on the outside like a hair shirt.

Lydia had no trouble getting people to have sex with her. She had a great ass. Firm, if somewhat small, boobs. The thing she couldn't understand was why no boys wanted anything to do with her outside of sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped, the smell of sex trailing them like skunk.

What was wrong with her that guys like James didn't want to stay? Were clueless males somehow onto her desire to make them weak and once they got what they wanted, they understood she didn't have anything else to give. What else would you give someone when you already gave them access to your body? She had no fucking clue.

Yesterday after marathon monkey sex in the NICC girls restroom, James had muttered, "I feel dirty."

She felt like he'd slapped her.

"I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's..." James thought for a long moment as if trying to gin up thoughts under his long surfer-blond hair. "You're like a Hoover. So mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels ... I don't know. Impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

James was holding a spent condom between his thumb and forefinger like a rat corpse when in fact, it was filled with his own sperm.

"You make me feel used," he said.

Used and abused was how she felt when he exited the community college restroom. Now waiting in the Antarctic of the unheated bathroom, she felt even worse. No wonder she was having more bulimic episodes.

They were the reason she was in Idaho. Her orthodontist in Grosse Point ratted her out to Grandpa Ben and Grandma Elaine. Apparently, the back sides of her teeth were pitted as a forty-year-old's. Here was the dilemma. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food but there was no fucking way she'd ever be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. It was a vicious cycle. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was so empty. She hadn't thought of it till that instant, but fucking her brains out for a few minutes lasted about as long as it took to eat a dozen donuts. Then, once you threw them up, you were empty and clean as snow.

By the time James shoved the shower rings open, Lydia was already clawing her way up his long, thin body and scissoring her legs around his waist. She groped at his belt buckle, trying to undo it and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!" She was feeling like the top of her head was going to blow off.

"No!" James pushed at her hands and shoved at the death grip she had around his hips. "I can't. What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" she cried, patting and pushing at the area below hi belt, looking for evidence of the welcome she was expecting. When she came up flat, she said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way her eyes rolled up in her head in that fit?"

He kept pushing at her but her years of gymnastics and ballet tightened the scissors grip on his hips so she ended up being pushed slowly toward his ankles. She felt like a donut being worked down to his shoes.

"Don't hold out on me. I need it."

"I'm not holding out. I can't..." James paused as if he was seeking the right word but in Lydia's mind, all she could feel was a volcano of heat and rage moving up her body from her crotch and she slapped him as hard as she could.

"What the hell? James's cheek flushed bright red where her hand had lit his skin like a flare. "Why'd you do that!?"

"I want sex. Give it to me."

Now the flush looked more like a trouble light on James's pale cheek. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly enticing me."

They were both breathing like long distance runners. James had managed to scrape her off his body and he was backing up toward the rear of the tub with an expression of disgust.

"You're a dickless wimp," she said.

"Now you're calling me names? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

"Fucking wimp." Then she threw out the worst insult she could call up from the pressure that was rising in her chest. "You're gay, aren't you?"

He was stepping over the porcelain basin to the floor, the curtain rings jangling like an alarm bells. "You weren't calling me a faggot earlier." James was referring to the quickie she gave him against the back wall of the Healing House garage when they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that the raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins before breakfast.

That was then, this is now, she thought. Didn't James know that her itch started from zero about thirty minutes after sex was over.

"You're a faggot!" she screamed. She didn't give a shit how many demerits or punishments she got or who heard her berating him. If James wouldn't get her off before she met her mother in an hour, she was going to implode anyway.

"Why would I fuck you?" James said, his hand paused on the porcelain door knob. You're a crazy bitch."

The door to the bathroom shut before she could think of anything worse to fling at him. She let her body slip down the wall and laid her head on the smooth white surface. It felt like he'd abandoned her on an ice flow out of sight of land.

Her mother laughed when Lydia wanted to climp up on her lap. She pushed at her small hands in order to hold her away from her skirt the way that James pushed her away from his belt buckle.

All she had wanted was to get close. To feel his heat, to warm up with hot sex and gushing body fluids and that feeling---even if only for a fleeting moment---of bodily connection.

"I can't," he said again. "That girl's fit... I can't even think about sex right now."

"Don't think," she cried. "all you have to do is feel." She scrabbled at his hands, holding tight to his waist with her legs while his superior weight inched her body down his legs like a donut.

That's when volcanic rage took over her. She forgot her coldness. She was so hot, it felt like a furnace blast of anger was fueling her.

"You fucking faggot!" she cried. "You can't get it up. You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked up in surprise. The red on his cheek bones where she slapped him burned brighter in his pale blue-white skin.

"Limp dick! "she screamed, slapping him again as hard as she could. "Dickless wonder!" Another slap.

He got hold of her hands and held her upper body away from him while her lower body scissored him about the hips. "You're nuts! Fucking certifiable. Can't you think of someone else for a goddamn minute?"

Time was maddeningly elastic at Inner Horizons. You were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards whenever you misbehaved or fucked up. The clock ran forward for short periods but if you earned a demerit for failing to take the trash out or you fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed or you wouldn't participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during Process Group, the clock would turn around and run backward away from you. Lydia would think she was heading toward more perks or weekend recreational passes or a chance for a weeklong trip home and just when she thought she was close to her reward, the crazy clock would rewind and she'd find herself back at ground zero.

If she had known the clock was broken, she could have accepted it but the fact that the clock ran fast sometimes and slow at others and then took a god-awful leap backward to put her at zero over and over again, made her hopeless with despair.

"That new girl... I thought she was dying," James said, holding her away from him with stiffened arms.

I'm dying, Lydia thought. I'm just not misfiring in Rachel's brain was ten times worse when it was buried and had no way to get scratched.twitching and gasping and jerked like a freak. Lydia's freak was on the inside and whatever electricity was

Rahel Bronfman Fiat, soon to be ex-Fiat whenever her next divorce came through, air-kissed Lydia on both cheeks. It occurred to Lydia that maybe her mother missed her cheeks by an inch because her daughter truly wasn't there.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A flutter of an eyelid told Lydia that Rahel hated that she'd stopped straightening her curls because she couldn't find a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "So informal and free." Translation: rough and hacked at enough to merit jail time in Manhattan where her mother lived.

If her mother held her nostrils any higher, Lydia would have liked to rip off Rahel's false eyelashes and shove them up her cosmetically enhanced nose. She had two nostrils, didn't she? Two roads to hell.

The sky was its usual color of cement. The van hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how the Idahoans said it). A French name from some trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just eleven kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of back-to-back storms.

They were barely five miles out of Coeur D'Alene when B James and Lydia got a warning for inappropriate touching. Josh made James sit up front with him, the better to keep his wandering hands from her crotch; Old Girl got stuck with Princess Lydia in the far back of the Suburban AKA Barfland.

Barfland felt glacial. Luckily, Lydia was pouting so OG didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Lydia had traded blow jobs for candy in the past week. Oral sex. Just another word for Idaho money, Lydia had told the new girl in the seat in front of them.

OG contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the non-view at Healing House. Endless blue trees. A white landscape where nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the frozen wilderness and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About three miles was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature dropped.

Josh told everybody the plan was to make them snowshoe up an ungroomed trail to Two Mouth Lake. They'd climb a thousand feet before they reached the main lake. He'd hang back with the slow hikers but it was OK with him if people who wanted a good workout kept pace with James; he was the fastest, so he got to lead. The hike was supposed to take a couple hours; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, everybody had to turn around toot-sweet, and double-time back to the van.

The Suburban throbbed north on Highway 95 with a migraine level of noise. Old Girl felt like life at Inner Horizons was one long assault on her ears. After Peggy and David drove off, the first thing she understood had been taken away was a quiet place to hear herself think.

Old Girl had dark plans for whoever had stolen the batteries from Josh's iPod. Nobody else was allowed to have electronics but Josh believed music soothed the savage beast, so he usually he let them have tunes. Now, when they really needed music to let loose, they were denied it. If OG had her way, she'd push the piece of glass she found on the street to the thief's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular glass shard she'd been keeping in her pocket. It was sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure. She pressed down, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

OG stopped to peel a piece of bark off a Ponderosa tree. James powered on up ahead and she hadn't realized Rachel was right on the heels . "Why do you keep picking stuff off tree trucks?\" Rachel asked.

["]{dir="rtl"}It smells like caramel."

That was true enough. If she wanted to offer up the smell of a ponderosa[']{dir="rtl"}s inner perfume to Gabe, who hadn[']{dir="rtl"}t lived long enough to smell it himself, what business was it of the new girl?

Rachel stepped off the trail and used her thumb to pry up her own puzzle-shaped piece of bark. She held it to her nose. ["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re right. It does smell like butterscotch." But of course, she couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t leave it at that. ["]{dir="rtl"}Why'd you pinch off the tip of the cedar trees back there?"

OG wanted to tell the nosy snitch to go catch up to James and stop spying on her. Then she reconsidered, in case part of the truth would satisfy her when the whole truth was too personal to admit. She held out a green-branchlet. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s incense cedar. It's really strong.

["]{dir="rtl"}No. That's not incense cedar. See how the branchlets aren't a uniform green? It's some kind of variegated type. I can[']{dir="rtl"}t remember what it[']{dir="rtl"}s called."

Oh my fucking God. Rumor had it that the Program was going to saddle her with a a stupid roommate. Of course, she had to be a botanistl. ["]{dir="rtl"}What's it to you what I smell? We've been cooped up for more than three weeks. It just feels good to smell something that isn[']{dir="rtl"}t bleach." Margaret was an enthusiastic cleaner but eco-sensitive, she was not. Time to turn the tables.

["]{dir="rtl"}Why aren't you up there crushing on James? How come you[']{dir="rtl"}re back here bugging me?"

["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t have a crush on James. What are you talking about?"

["]{dir="rtl"}So that wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t James down on his knees back there ,adjusting your snowshoe?"

["]{dir="rtl"}I accidentally stepped on his webbing."

["]{dir="rtl"}You didn[']{dir="rtl"}t do it on purpose? Everybody here is hot for James. Just don[']{dir="rtl"}t let Lydia catch you or she[']{dir="rtl"}ll eat you alive."

Rachel laughed. ["]{dir="rtl"}She is kind of scary, even if she only weight ninety pounds." They were climbing steadily up a snowy trail that followed a burbling creek. Rachel spotted something pale and green growing near a patch of algae, then surprised OG by handing her a stalk. ["]{dir="rtl"}Smell this. It[']{dir="rtl"}s a weird one."

OG took the long onion-like plant and ran her finger along its rough and abrasive leaf. She inhaled at the whitewash bulb, expecting the bite of onions but got a hint of musk. She offered the new scent up silently to Gabe like a prayer, anyway. ["]{dir="rtl"}What is it?"

Rachel was already picking up speed on her way up the trail past OG. She called back over her shoulder. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s called mountain death camus. I don't want a roommate either. Feel free to eat it."

OG blinked. So the kitty has claws.

Who gave a shit if the newbie didn[']{dir="rtl"}t want to make friends? OG didn[']{dir="rtl"}t have time for friends, especially now that she had decided to run. And just like that, in the tick of an unseen clock, she was no longer concerned with surviving. She was leaving.

Hazey Works for Margaret?

Hazey raised his glass to me, my and mine!

Margaret filled the doorway\-- damn, should have locked it\-- and she responded by raising her empty hand like she was clinking a glass. \"Skoal? What are we celebrating?\"

Hazey gestured to the bottle on the desk. \"Have a drink, my girl. Here\'s to Healing House II.\"

Margaret surprised him by reaching for his coffee mug and helping herself to a healthy slug. \"Great news! To us!\" She clinked the mug which said \"The Boss\'s Cup\" to his with a glint in her eye.

\"To world domination,\" Hazey said.

Why did Hazey feel like a gauntlet had been thrown down? The woman leaned forward and said, \"I\'m here to negotiate my employment.\"

Hazey narrowed his eyes. The problem with employees was that that they all thought he worked for them, instead of the other way around. A staff of 30 meant 30 people telling him what to do.

\"I know about your drug use,\" she said.

Hazey wanted his mug back. And the liquor she\'d just swallowed.

"I\'m not sure what you\'re implying.\"

\"I\'m not implying anything. I know how you\'re writing prescriptions for kids who aren\'t here.\"

Hazey inhaled and the Chivas burned a path down the wrong windpipe. He started choking and coughing trying to clear it and the next thing he knew, Margaret was pounding on his back. Big hammering blows. The woman had fists like a meat packer.

\"Stop! I\'m\--\*choke, snort\*\-- OK.\"

\"I thought you were stroking out.\"

\"I just swallowed the wrong way.\"

Neither one of them said anything. Hazey felt his pulse hammering in his veins and there was a pulling sensation in his scrotum like the housekeeper had him by the balls.

Finally, he said, \"What do you intend to do with this information?\"

Margaret\'s eye flickered like she was considering her next chess move.

\"I don\'t intend anything,\" she said. \"I want Gretchen\'s job.\"

Hazey blinked. The woman was insane. \"She\'s a registered dietician.\"

\"So she says,\" Margaret\'s face was dark with disdain.

\"I hate to tell you this Margaret, but you\'re a housekeeper. What makes you think you\'re qualified to take Gretchen\'s job?\"

"I can cook. She can\'t.\"

\"A dietician does a lot more than cook,\" Hazey said. \"She plans the meals, keeps track of the calorie counts\...\"

\"I\'m the one who does all that,\" Margaret said. \"Gretchen just signs off on my reports.\"

Hazey automatically fumbled in his coat pocket for the comfort of the pill bottle. He was shaking out a Xanax before it occurred to him maybe this wasn\'t a good time to indulge.

Margaret was busy lining up a row of small empty bottles on the front of his desk.

\"Alison Levey. Paul Prentice. Jamal Rashid.\" See looked up. \"I dont\' remember him\-- must have been before my time.\" Nine of the names Margaret read out were currently in residence.

\"Seriously, Doctor Hazey, you\'ll love my cooking. Better yet the kids will love it. And you won\'t have to listen to any more complaints.\"

Food complaints were the bane of his existence. Just that morning he\'d fielded an irate call from the mother of Omar, a kid who needed to lose 50 pounds. She\'d accused him of starving the boy. He didn\'t know it but he was pretty sure that Omar wasn\'t on a restricted diet. The kid could stuff himself for all Hazey cared, which is what he wanted to tell the mother instead of saying he\'d look into the issue and get back to her.

\"What does Gretchen make, anyway?\" Margaret asked.

\"None of your business!\"

\"It will be when I have her job. Fulltime hours plus benefits. I\'ll be the best employee you\'ve ever hired, I swear it.\"

The pill bottles line up in front of him looked like soldiers on a firing line.

\"What am I going to tell Gretchen?\" he said. The Xanax in his palm tingled like it had a magnetic pole that was calling to his fillings.

\"I\'ll take Healing House I and she can have Healing House II. We\'ll split the baby and it will work out fine.\"

\"And the prescriptions?\"

Margaret was already scooping the pill bottles onto her purse. \"What prescriptions?\" She said sweetly. \"I don\'t know anything about that.\"

She got up and walked out, taking the Bosses mug with her.

Hazey tossed back the Xanax he\'d been holding onto with the last of his Chivas.

At least he had an answer for Omar\'s mother. He\'d hired a new nutritionist who would meet the boy\'s exacting culinary standards, he was sure of it.

Lydia and Cowboy Encounter

Lydia didn't mind giving blowjobs. She wasn\'t squeamish about the smells or the taste. The sense of power she had with someone\'s dick in her mouth was worth almost as much as the money. \$100 for ten minutes seemed like an OK trade when it meant she could buy a Sephora makeup palette or a pair of Lulus, plus feel someone shiver and tremble under the touch of her tongue.

Lydia had been meeting the cowboy in the parking lot for a month. She\'d walked by him in his pickup downtown and he gave her a ride back to campus and had squawked a little about the price till she demonstrated a loss leader. She didn\'t know that much about him\-- there wasn\'t a lot of talking when he was pressing his cowboy hat over your head to cover up what was going on in his lap. She thought his name was Ned and she was surprised when Margaret called him Jed. Wasn\'t Jed a made-up name from TV like those stupid Beverly Hills Hillbillies reruns the maids in Detroit liked to watch?

What is the scene about? If Lydia\'s is in the back seat of the van, in the way way back she\'s separated herself from Margaret who defended her and James who defended Margaret.

Lydia is surprised to be defended. She thinks giving a blowjob is mostly a business transaction. I do this you give me money. She knows she\'s not supposed to\-- her therapist is always saying, \"What do you get out of it?\" and in Jed\'s case, she get money. She also feels power; when someone shakes and trembles and their breathing quickens, she\'s on a power trip. It\'s like she plugs into the juice and when they come the connection snaps.

What are the connections beyond Margaret, James and Lydia? Jed SImplot could sell Rusty the container or Jed could drop off potatoes at the Povarello Center where James encounters him right after Reza makes the joke about Lydia in front of Lorenzo.

Lydia had scooted to the far back of the van, as far away from Margaret as she could get. She expected to be yelled at or guilt tripped or flogged or something. So when the silence stretched out the length of the ride back to Healing House, she wondered when the lecture was going to start.

Her therapist Rosa was always asking her what all the sex was about. \"What do you get out of it?\" was her question every time Lydia got caught. \"I get money,\" which is what Jed handed over when she met him between classes for a quickie. If she was honest with herself which she wasn\'t it wasn\'t just the money. Sure! She had something men\-- and occasionally women wanted. It was a fairly straight forward business transaction. I do this. You give me that. But that\'s didn\'t account for every sex act she felt compelled to seek out.

She did it standing up in an alley, she did it in the boys bathroom once when some other guy was peeing in the urinal, she did it in Jed\'s pickup, under cover of the table at Dunkin so many times she'd lost count, all because she liked how powerful she felt. Getting paid was a bonus when you could tap into someone\'s juice with a flick of a tongue. Men trembled. Men shook! They quivered and got goose bumps and groaned when she blew their brains out the slit at the tip of their joy sticks. That was power she couldn\'t get enough of.

She never felt more in control than when she was either promising sex or delivering it. The problem was the minute it was over the juice turned off. She felt unplugged and out of control and bereft.

Now she was sorry she\'d run to the back of the van. The back window was iced over inside. It was like sitting in an iceberg after being in a sauna.

Margaret still hadn\'t said a word. She was chewing a piece of gum like she was trying to bite it into little pieces.

Jed had flipped her off when Margaret towed her away from him. He seemed to have some weird idea that she should have defended him form Margaret and her purse.

\"Hey Margaret,\" she called out, moving out of the frigid North 40 and close to the heater. \"Who called the doctor? Who called the Nurse? Who called the lady with the alligator purse?\"

James joined in and they sang all the verses they could remember, beating time on the seats and the dashboard.

\"What the heck do ya have in that thing?\" James asked Margaret when they finished. \"Rocks?\"

Margaret drove one handed while she scrabbled around in the gap between the seats. She hauled out a lunch box and flipped open the lid. \"Want some carrots?\" She offered them to James and he passed the box to Lydia. Then she found what she\'d been scrabbling around for with a cry of delight. \"There you are!\"

A crescent wrench the size of a man\'s forearm! It must have weighed ten pounds and Margaret was holding it up like a symbol of the Russian revolution.

\"Margaret! You could have killed that guy!\" James said.

Lydia said \"What\'s that doing in your purse?\"

Margaret acted like it was perfectly normal. \"There\'s a leak in the girl\'s bathroom. I was going to change the gasket.\"

\"Why don\'t you call the plumber?\" said Lydia.

\"It\'s just a gasket. Anybody can change one.\"

\"I can\'t,\" Lydia said.

\"You don\'t know how to change a gasket? That\'s criminal. I\'ll show you after you tell your therapist what you were doing in Jed\'s pickup.\"

\"Right after I tell her you nearly killed him,\" Lydia said.

\"You wouldn\'t.\"

\"I would.\"

\"Me too,\" said James. \"I definitely would. With a crescent wrench. You\'re insane.\"

\"He was using Lydia. He deserved everything he got.\"

Margaret shot a dark look at Lydia. \"He\'s old enough to be your dad. That\'s sick.\"

\"So\'s hitting him between the ears with a crescent wrench,\" Lydia retorted.

\"What difference does it make how old he is? He likes me.\"

\"I can see he likes you. That\'s why he was making you give him head in broad daylight. So romantic. Just because a guy comes on to you, you don\'t have to say yes.

It was impossible for Lydia to explain how she was the one using whoever she had sex with. Already, not half an hour after Margaret had hauled her out of the pickup, she was feeling the emptiness, the power hungry itch that only one thing would scratch. It wasn\'t that she liked Jed\-- hell she though his name was Ned\-- but she loved the way she could control him by touch and make his body do things that he clearly had no control over. Shake. Quiver. Flood. It wasn\'t about her orgasm, not that she didn\'t like them. It was about making him fall apart. Completely helpless and under her thumb.

Margaret waggled her index finger at both of them \"You two. What am I going to do with you?\"

\"Nothing?\" James said in the manner of penitent choirboy.

\"Don\'t ask, don\'t tell,\" Lydia said encouragingly. \"My lips are sealed.\"

Margaret shot a warning look at her. \"Your lips better be sealed, missy. If I see you with Jed Simplot again\-\--,\" she shook her heavy purse and the sound of metal clanked like a bell. \"Against my better judgment,\" Margaret said.

\"Forget the judgment,\" James advised.\" Go for your own self interest.\"

Margaret didn\'t just demonstrate how to change the gasket. She made Lydia pull the faucet and clean out the gunk in the trap and replace the washers and rings. James did the same drill on another sink. It felt good to do something with her hands. \"You\'re a wiry little thing,\" Margaret told her. \"And a quick study.\"

She liked the compliment and when the water gushed out of the pipe and shot off clean without a drip, she felt a small surge of pride.

\"When you graduate from the program, maybe we should become plumber\'s apprentices,\" James said.

\"It pays better than Day Supervisor,\" Margaret said.

\"Does it pay better than sucking dick?\" Lydia wanted to know.

\"You! Just when I think you\'re making progress you slip back into your old habits.\" Margaret took back the crescent wrench and told her it was time to meet with Rosa.

\"Tell her what you learned today,\" Margaret said.

\"About changing gaskets or giving blowjobs?\"

\"Whichever one you learned more from,\" Margaret said.

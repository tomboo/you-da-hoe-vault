122118 Winter scape here and now write

Blue and white colors. Frost in the air. The feeling of cold lurking outside one's warm coat and boots. If you are moving, you feel warm but when you stop, the cold seeps into the body and numbs her feet and hands. Her brain is its usual bright ember though she knows that if she doesn't get moving, it will slow and dull and get sleepy too.

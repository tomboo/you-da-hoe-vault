**Felling**

Enough tensile strength

in the orange-ribbed strap

connecting sawyer to saw

to let its weight fall

and bounce against chaps

or trunk without ripping.

Should it slip

or come unclipped

from his harness

it would fall

onto boughs

the crew piles

around the tree

to soften the thud

of large limbs

until the tree

becomes a pole,

which he climbs again

with spurs and a belt

he wraps round the trunk

until near the top

he revs his saw,

cuts a round,

hefts it up

and away

letting it fall

into the pile of boughs.

Crushed needles

sawdust scent

as his crew dragged

brush and branches

to the truck or chipper.

I dug up plants

in the path of boots

Christmas rose

dwarf lilac

huckleberry

sword fern

salmon berry

oxalis.

I list.

Not proud

of my gunnery.

I'm messing around

until the men

and machinery

quiets and quits.

More light

more heat

in its absence

I wrought.

## Shavuot - Day of Revelation

Thirty-ninth day

after liberation

we say it

so it is so

we pray it

so it is so

gathered

to wonder

at how awe

struck us

in our wandering

for a few brief

honey-rayed days

after revelation

we relished

that not everything

is of our own making.

Everything is

of our own making:

unstoppable

unstopperable

inoperable

systole

diastole

pulse

junk

ticking

a pace

in our bones

now

yet we still

open

the Book

that claims

the literal One

made it

and makes it

Together we stood

together fled

we know that

to be true:

filched candlesticks

a birthing stool

shoes that cost

20 shekels

more factual

than a prophets' signs

than a hand

turning white

with leprosy

than the one man

walking down

the mountain

carrying words

on fire

carving

the world.

## Butterflies

Those yellow flitting wings on and off

bee balm are butterflies not warblers.

When do you see butterflies anymore?

Where Rufous hummingbirds crowd feeders.

Where native orchards live in woods.

Soft green stalks, two white Cessna-wing petals

or are they sails with purple-brown spinnakers,

or maybe more like a frog's puffed throat

or an apron full of sugar peas

The orchids' pouches are empty. I looked,

certain such elegant form had function.

Not even a gnat in its hold.

Too dangerous to tell you its name and coordinates.

Who wouldn't want to be an orchid thief?

The variety of forms! All vain in their waxen,

more than momentary beauty on par with jade,

even those on sale this week at Safeway.

I dig one up to transport it home.

In answer to your question, it dies.

##  

## 

## A gentle rain 

falls on newly transplanted

lettuce, which the dog peed on.

She'll sleep in her Dog-loo

all day waiting for her owner

while I wait for my doctor to call

to prove I'll live when yesterday

I believed my heart would stop.

I lay in the back seat of my car

parked at a high-end mall

breathing to slow my pulse.

Shoppers walked by checking phones,

sipping wheat-grass and pineapple smoothies.

Gentle, gentle rain, let me be as kind

as you are watering the bleeding hearts

and hyacinth, propping them up

so they'll last until the end of June.

THIS IS A VERY FUNNY POEM TO ME, knowing your proclivity for believing that you are dying. I feel your self-deference, your sense of humor. I am wishing for 1 or 2 other moments of poking fun at yourself though the topic of dying and illness is anything but. It feels like it would be more successful if it gave more of yourself in the vein of the lettuce that the dog peed on. That is my clue that there is a serious side and a non-serious, playful side to the poem that both pokes fun at your fears and yet believes them.

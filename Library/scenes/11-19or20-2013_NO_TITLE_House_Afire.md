House Afire

Today I\'m writing about a house afire.

The temperature had been hovering around zero. The cloudless sky had cut crystal starlight felt colder to Old Girl. She roused the girl\'s wing screaming while Charleen, the Duty, hollered at the boy\'s to get out.

Now they were watching flame shoot out of the back door. A volunteer firefighter was chopping a hole in the roof while another sprayed a horse tail of water on the walls.

Some people had grabbed blankets and Reza had a bath towel around his skinny shoulders and in his boxer, shorts his hairy legs looked like tooth picks, white and shivering. Charleen took one look at him and shoved a ski jacket at him from a bundle she managed to rescue from the front entry. \"Jesus, ya ding bat. You\'ll freeze your ass if you don\'t put this on! I told you to get dressed.\"

Reza seemed to think standing around in his boxers with the girls was his idea of heaven. He twisted the striped bath towel into a turban and zipped the short jacket up to his neck. He looked like a bare-assed Arab lost in the snow.

Meanwhile, Rachel was crying about losing her photo album. By the time Old Girl ran down the hall and pounded on every door, making sure everybody got out, Rachel was already out in the snow.

Their room was the closest to the laundry room where the fire seemed to have started. At least, that\'s what Old Girl guessed based on the firefighters frantic chopping and hosing and their staticky calls on the radio.

Old Girl started toward Rachel, thinking she ought to say something, but James cut in front of her. He took a blanker from his shoulders and wrapped Rachel in a bear hug from behind. \"It\'s alright,\" James kept repeating. \"You\'re safe.\"

Lydia was in a tee shirt and a pair of frog printed sleep shorts. Ugg boots came up to her knees but she was eyeing at Rachel\'s blanket like she would kill for it.

Rachel, to Old Girl\'s surprise, opened the front of the blanket and said, \"Come here.\"

Lydia had the expression of a starving person being offered a piece of bread. She leaned forward like she wanted to kept but then she stopped like she couldn\'t believe Rachel was serious. Finally James shouted at Lydia to get her moving. \"Get in here before you freeze!\"

If you were looking at the 3 of them say a bird\'s eye view from a Ponderosa pine in the fire lit yard, you would have seen an Indian blanket sandwich. James, the tallest, wrapped Rachel from behind and Rachel, a little shorter, wrapped Lydia within her arms like a set of Russian matryoshka dolls.

A volunteer firefighter seemed stopped in his tracks by the tree way. He wasn\'t manning a hose or carrying ladders or shouting to his mates in the organized chaos that was bringing the fire under patrol.

He was glaring at the blanket hug and Old Girl thought for a second he was going to throw a set of wire cutters he held in his hand.

"Hey, Rusty!\" Somebody with a badge was shouting. The strange guy walked off carrying the wire cutters and when Old Girl looked around for him a few minutes later he was gone.

Weird, she thought. It was cold and once the adrenalin started to wear off from waking everybody up, it felt even colder. In malevolence on the man\'s face made her shiver, even through the heat of a down jacket and two sweaters she\'d pulled over a flannel nightgown.

\"Do you know a firefighter?" she asked Rachel when they were being herded back into Healing House. They\'d blocked off the girl\'s wing by closing the fire doors and the plan was to set up a makeshift slumber party in the living room.

Rachel said \"What firefighter?\" And Old Girl couldn\'t see the greasy haired man anywhere. \"He was standing over here,\" she said. \"When James gave you the blanket.

Rachel looked blank.

\"He seemed to know you,\" she said.

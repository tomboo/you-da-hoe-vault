070215 Twenty bucks for polish remover

The twenty dollar bill called to her. She'd been trying out the Goth Girl look and here was no way to do Goth or punk without black nails. Mom would have a shit fit if she saw them. Still, Lydia had never stolen a thing in her life. It seemed random to take something when she had something like \$20 million in her trust fund and that was chump change in the Bronfman family. But she couldn't live without nail polish remover.

She'd spent the measly \$5 a week the Program gave them on gum. Five dollars! It was like an insult. Just enough to remind you that needed money for everything else.

The thought *just take it* whipped through her like the electrical charge that was zipping around the new gir splayed out on the floor like Frankengirl. Lydia's hand was tucking the bill into her pocket before it finished its circuit.

She made the mistake of looking sideways and Old Girl gave her the stink eye. That one never bothered with nail polish. Her nails were broken and ragged or chewed down to the quick with red, angry cuticles.

Everyone at the Program told each they were nuts but Old Girl meant it when she called her a crazy fuck. Lydia already felt small enough; she didn't need to feel smaller when the tiny tyrant that was her mother would be armed with a perfect French manicure to cut her down to size. She made a note to stay away from Old Girl so she didn't accidentally disappear.

You weren't calling me a faggot yesterday," James said. He was referring to the quickie she gave him against the back wall of the Healing House garage when they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that the raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins.

That was yesterday, she thought. Doesn't James know that her itch started from zero about thirty minutes after sex was over.

"That new girl... I thought she was dying."

I'm dying, Lydia thought. I'm just not twitching and gasping and jerked like a freak. Lydia's freak was on the inside and whatever electricity was misfiring in Rachel's brain was ten times worse when it was buried and had no way to get scratched.

Why Lydia waited, shifting from foot to foot, to keep warm, she pushed the image of the new girl's head thumping against the hardwood away. The sightless eyes rolling white in her skull. The strange uncoordinated shivering and trembles. The itch, as relentless and bad as it was, at least it was on Lydia's inside with all the other horrible things locked up in her. Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside of her petite and perfectly maintained body. It was a small mercy but at least she didn't have to wear her ugliness like a hair shirt.

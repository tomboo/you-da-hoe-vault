ONE

Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy when all you had to draw upon were the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Nine young adults between 17 and 20 years old --- "YAs," as the staff at Inner Horizons called them --- were straggling into the Healing House living room for 10 AM Process Group. Three couches had been shoved together to form their usual off-kilter circle but only one resident was on time. Big Paul lay curled up in a fetal position on the beige love seat when Darlene rapped the meditation gong sharply.

Nobody wanted to get stuck on the Jizz Couch since Lydia had been caught banging Alex, her therapist, on it. Hence all the pushing and shoving to get a space on the Rorschach couch with the black blots and rusty stains.

Dani checked Lydia, her nemesis, with her big ham-hock hip and earned an outraged hiss. Darlene threw the stink eye at both of them but Dani won the printed couch, crowing. \"Mine, suckers, mine!\"

Lydia stretched out full length on the rusty plaid cushions, taking the entire sofa for herself. She mouthed silently, "Eat me." Why should Lydia care about sitting on the wet spot when the bodily fluids were mostly her own?

Welcome to Process Group.

A bitch fest of petty resentments and one-up-mans-ship and oversharing and drama marked by an occasional \"Language!\" from Darlene Muncy, the therapist on duty.

Darlene put a weary end to the catfight, saying, "Demerit card to Dani, one to Lydia. See me after Process for paperwork."

Then she turned without a pause."Meet the newest member of the Inner Horizons team!" she cried, like a cheer leader. "Rachel Interlachen! Yay!" Old Girl tuned Darlene out while she droned on about the new black girl who had arrived last night.

On the weekend, Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two ex-cops in matching ski jackets and T*rust in God, Buy a Gun* baseball caps. That meant Rachel's mom and dad had paid a bundle to have their flipped out, freaked out, raging mad, or catatonically comatose daughter escorted to Idaho by personal guard to get her into treatment. Girl, you better get ready for heads to whip around when you walk down a street in Coeur D\'Alene. The Aryan Nations headquarters is less than 15 miles away at Hayden Lake and the only black people they want to see here are on *Cops*.

Rachel, a tall girl with very dark skin and a hollow face, wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." On her eggplant-colored wrists were raised horizontal scars. Not vertical. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like her and most of the girls in the program.

Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Old Girl turned her ottoman toward the front lawn and contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear growing on the eave. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the longest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth that lined the roof. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

A curtain of snow cut off any hint of the massive Ponderosa pines that ringed the yard. It had started falling last October and was apparently going to keep on falling until May, Dim sulfurous light beat its way through the gloom.

Old Girl was eleven when she made her first suicide attempt. She had raided the medicine cabinet at her guardians' house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was that Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the universe along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seed caplets and fish oil jammed the shelves, but Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's most embarrassing way to go?

At 17, after a year and a half in Adolescents, Old Girl now applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to kill herself. Nothing gross, for example. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor who thought someone had pushed her beyond the ropes---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water she expelled so hard that she burst a blood vessel in one eye ---all fluids were verboten. Double-ditto road rash, like the kind she got when she'd fallen out of Uncle David's Buick turning a corner on the way home from picking her up at middle school. Her body weight carried her out the unlatched door and she learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. It wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken arm and the harrowing experience of having gravel picked out of her hip with forceps.

Hanging? Definitely off the approved list. The big objection to asphyxiation was something she'd read about how your tongue swells up three times its normal size and then hangs out of your mouth like a brown banana. No thank you.

When Old Girl moved from Ads to YAs after New Years, she left her single room at Calm Cottage ---don't even get her started on the Program's stupid names---and moved into Healing House which was 15 miles from Couer d'Alene. The property bordered on the Kootenai National Forest. Next door on the other side was the dump.

She couldn't see any improvement in the level of maturity from Ads to YAs, unless she counted the fluency in psychobabble. The first thing new resident learned was to spout on like paid professionals about accountability and personal validation and developmental delays.

Healing House was also a lot more beat up than Calm Cottage. It was a one story ranch house. Old Girl assumed that was to prevent people from jumping. The living area separated two sleeping wings that angled away from each other. The wings were named for old Indian tribes: girls lived in the Flat Head; boys slept in the Black Feet wing. It took about one nanosecond for the wing names to devolve to the Fat Asses and the Black Heads. Somewhere in Dr. Hazey's small empire of repurposed residences around town, he had a manor home named for the Shoshones where the Show Ponies cavorted.

Naturally Fat Asses couldn't fraternize with Black Heads, and vice versa. Residents ate together, processed together, recreated together, and slept by themselves. God forbid you actually got close to anyone.

The wall thermometer outside read 28 degrees. An hour before, it was 23 degrees. Yippee! Idaho's definition of spring.

At breakfast, she'd overheard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the fix-it guy who picked up the trash whenever he felt like it. Margaret told him to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl, who was consumed by thoughts of suicide, that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery.

How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The insistence in Margaret's loud voice that morning made it seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who drove a rackety ancient truck that held double stacked rows of jouncing barrels. Maybe melting was the key. The icicle dripped moisture when it warmed up during the day, then refroze into lethal weapons at night.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her suicide attempts---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straight hair fan out like a sun storm in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process of dreads had squeezed the copper out of her hair. Now it looked dull as cardboard. Death would pale her freckles; she supposed. Would it also flatten her hooked nose?

Usually she covered her strange proportions with baggy jeans or dark shapeless sweats. Her long legs made her look like a stork with the heavy breast of a turkey. The Fedora hat she wore to look hip wasn't very practical when it was freezing. She would have to carry it in her backpack and wear the black, pilling ski hat with the earflaps until the last minute.

Combing out her dreads out would be a terrible job.

Margaret would have to wield the scissors. Anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Lydia Bronfman was a cutter. She had lost the argument about who had to process first. She was also a nympho and bulimic and the only child from some famous beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the mid-west in her nasal singsong Accountability Letter for fucking Axel Friedman, her therapist. Everybody was mad at Lydia for getting Axel fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's \$12,000-a-month fees. It wasn't clear to Old Girl why Lydia was apologizing. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall since she had sex with everybody. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat alone in the corner, could count that high.

Lydia channeled Marilyn Monroe while she listed behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing in a breathy voice. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she said, playing to the audience. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody said."

Darlene rapped her clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

"How can I take ownership if I don't tell you what I did?" Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by diamond earrings the size of nickels.

Darlene pinched the rutted space between her eyes. "Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Dani earned a living as a nude dancer to spite her parents who were evangelicals. Lydia, trying to outdo Dani, babbled on. The two of them were so self-involved, so clueless about anyone else in the room, Old Girl wanted to choke them with the same rope. The problem was there was no rope at Inner Horizons. No rope, no long scarves, no ties for bathrobes, no leather to hold up a pair of pants (the boys whined about this incessantly). Nothing longer than a shoe lace and even those were kept under lock and key.

Old Girl looked down at lumpy bumpy laces tied a million times and felt a bad case of captive rage coming on. Captive rage was like captor rage, except more vicious. When you had captor rage, there was some dim glimmer of understanding that the night duty or day super or van driver was making \$8 bucks an hour and didn\'t want to be at Inner Horizons any more than you did. But when you got captive rage, all the blame was aimed at yourself.

Lydia had met Old Girl on her first day of lock up with the phrase, \"Welcome to You-Da-Ho.\"

Udahoe? Old Girl was stupid enough to ask.

\"No, You-Da-HO.\" Lydia emphasized the last syllable. \"You da crazy ho who screwed up by getting yourself locked up in bum-fuck Idaho, with a bunch of crazy fuckers you\'ll never get away from.\"

At the time, she thought it was a lame ass joke until she realized it was so dead on that the phrase turned into an ear worm she couldn\'t shake.

Old Girl was so tired. She had a hard time sleeping because her mind kept itself busy fabricating scenes of her death. She liked scenarios that were as plot driven as mysteries. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Vera Wang dresses. Weather and setting, depending on her mood, varied between dark and creep-meister or grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she would imagine a fishing boat that sailed on oblivious to a body falling out of the sky. Tragedy didn't have to slap you in the face.

She wondered how much warmer it had to get to make the icicle do its work. If she watched the temperature during Process Group three times a week and checked it before dinner every day, she'd get a read on the melting and refreezing progress. The problem with real life was that there was so little you could control.

"Angela! Wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice, cut into her daydream. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle, Angela," Darlene said.

Old Girl shook her head. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally would *not* answer to the name she'd been given before her family vanished. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and an ache in her throat from having her stomach pumped, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, the new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?" said Darlene.

"I don't know anybody named Angela."

"I'm sorry. Would Old Girl please join us?" Darlene put air quotes around the name "Old Girl."

The pleasures of double homicide-suicide were in her mind as she swiveled obediently back to the group. A black-and-white photo gallery took up one wall of the living room. Thirty or so people from the early 20^th^ Century were eyeing Process Group with judgmental eyes. Old Girl wondered what the old street sweeper at work with a hand-made broom or the brick maker who carried hundreds of pounds of bricks on his shoulder would make of the whining and rationalizing and griping and blaming and circle-jerking that defined processing.

On the bright side, she added the number 29 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that the old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never coming up to breathe.

Lydia was now blabbering about how she'd coerced a police officer with a blowjob. Her short black curls bobbed over a pink cashmere sweater. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene made a note, and then flipped to a clean page on the clipboard.

"It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist's shake up after Axel's departure.

Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved to Young Adults. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized founder Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from the get-go. A Yale degree in psychiatry on Hazey's wall said he specialized in Adolescents, probably because he still was one, though the man was practically senile. She'd seen the year 1986 on one of a dozen diplomas mounted on his office wall one day when she was too wound up to sit during session. That would mean Hazey had to be what... almost fifty?

James Olson, the blonde, quiet surfer from Malibu, California, now had the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd said in one of those tense, shame-fests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get up. He was saying, "I traded my Revos for the candy," when Darlene wanted to know how he could afford Jelly Bellies on his \$5-a-week snack allowance.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high. Darlene wanted to know whom he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, his room mate and a meth-addict motor-mouth, had supplied the candy because Reza's New York Jets cap had the Revos hanging off the back of it. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. After three months without running away, Young Adults were allowed to take 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with his trade. At Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex. Ching-ching-ching. A galaxy of Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, another drip of moisture beaded up and rolled down the icicle to the edge of the eaves. It hung there as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions.

Time thinned until Old Girl blinked and then the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time seven more people processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism --- if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it--- and then it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged her to share something with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

The curtain of streaming snow was now so thick it cut off any hint of the blue-black wall of fir trees that ringed the yard. The sun hung out there somewhere. Too weak and wan to do more than ooze sulfurous yellow light through the swirling flakes.

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced outside,then at the ceiling as if she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's failures had aged her. Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled slowly backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

Could James feel the new girl\'s bolt of electricity like she could? It felt like she was being electrocuted by proxy and it scared her, this feeling of polar opposites connected. Her white hands gripped Rachels slim black upper arms with an iron grip. Underneath her fingrs she couldfeel bones as delicate as green tree limbs but pulsing with alien life.

The jolting and sparking was deeply unnerving. It made Old Girl want to run at the same time that her hands were stapled to Rachel\'s body in the act of being kidnapped by runaway life.

Jesus, she was thinking. Get me out of here!

From the stricken look in James blue eyes opposite her as he held on for dear life to her shins, she understood that he was feeling the same awe and horror and shame. James could no more disconnect tthan she could.

Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck. This girl needs us to hold her to this earth and I can barely hold myself here with everything I\'ve got.

Up to that moment, running had always been in Old Girl\'s mind as an fuzzy possibility. She was exactly like every other resident at Inner Horizons. She hated and loathed the Program and woke up every morning believing she couldn\'t stand it one more day, then woke the next morning and saw that she was still here. The constant psychobabble about self- actualization and self-denial and self-development and self-knowledge and self education and self-disgust made her acutely aware that the only way to save her sorry self was to run.

No more shilly-shallying. Run tonight.

Shilly-shallying\--where had that come from? Shilly-shallying was something her mother would have said if she wasn\'t now a greasy spot on the railroad tracks with Dad and baby Gabe after being shoved into a train by a geriatric driver who mistook his gas pedal for a brake. No shilly-shallying there.

The senior citizen had been going 45 miles per hour when he crashed into them from the rear and the train was going 50 when it hit them on the tracks and there was basically nothing left but gristle and bone when it came time to bury them. This from matter-of-fact Aunt Peggy who conveyed this nugget of information to her best friend when she thought Old Girl was out coldon the couch with a sedative the day after it happened.

She brought her attention back to Rachel\'s surprisingly firm biceps. Her eggplant colored hands thumped against the floor while her heels beat their own crazy tattoo even though James had a white-knuckled grip on her shins.

Shilly-shallying is over. Go now.

FIND A PLACE FOR

Time was maddeningly elastic at Inner Horizons. You were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards if you fucked up. The clock ran forward for short periods but if you earned a demerit, say, for failing to take the trash out or fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed, or you refused to participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during Process Group like the one going on right now, the clock would turn around and run backward and taunting away from you. Old Girl had experienced heading toward a weekend recreational passes or a once, a chance for a weeklong trip home to Aunt Peggy and Uncle David, and just when she thought she was close to getting on a plane, the crazy clock would rewind and she'd find herself back at ground zero.

If she had known the clock was broken, she could have accepted it but the fact that the clock ran fast sometimes and slow at others and then took a god-awful leap backward to put her at zero over and over again made her hopeless with despair.

041917 Lydia beats OG to the money

Lydia. Always a step ahead when it came to herself! Damn. She could have used that money to add to her minuscule stash of cash. \$36.58! She\'d sold her North Face jacket worth \$250 bucks for \$25 to an Indian girl in her English class. She looked like she needed it more than Old Girl did.

Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia smoothly pluckekd and palmed the twenty and moved off toward the bathroom by the kitchen. She bumped James in the butt on her way past.

Old Girl sighed. Another sexcapade in the making. Did James and Lydia think people were blind to their hook-ups? Apparently.

James was good looking except for the man bun. Blond. Blue-eyed. A carefully cultivated surfer dude look that must have been hard to maintain in Idaho where everyone blimped around in puffy down and wool hats yanked down to the cheek bones. But Old Girl felt nothing when she looked at him. She existed in a deep freeze, completely insulated from human warmth. No interest in body-to-body touching what so ever. All feeling\--good and bad\--had fled with her family. Absence didn\'t make the heart grow fonder, in her experience; it made her heart grow colder until it turned into a block of ice.

Darlene and Bruce, the driver, aided by Margaret, scurried around getting the girl loaded into the van. They\'d decided to drive her to the emergency room at Kootenai General. Faster than waiting for an ambulance to drive 15 miles out to Healing House, then drive another 15 miles back before they got her into the hospital.

In all the hustle and hoo-ja relating to Rachel, Darlene forgot her purse.

Old Girl spotted it next to the wingback chair where she\'d been sitting at Process Group. She reached to grab it but Lydia scooped up the bag first.

The little shit!

Lydia plucked a \$20 bill Old Girl had spotted in the wallet and palmed it at the same time she called out loudly, \"Darlene! Your bag!\"

Old Girl could have used the money to add to her minuscule stash of cash. She had painstakingly over months amassed a grand total of 37 dollars and 51 cents. How that was going to get her to Seattle, she had no idea.

In the wallet, a twenty dollar bill peeked out a green corner. Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia plucked and palmed the bill in one smooth motion while she called out loudly, \"Darlene! Your purse!\"

Darlene rushed back in the living room and took the bag, thanking Lydia profusely. Lydia smiled beneficently and flashed Old Girl a middle finger behind her back. So much for adding to her minuscule stash of cash she was planning to run with. How she was going to get to Seattle on thirty-four dollars and thirty-one cents, she had no clue.

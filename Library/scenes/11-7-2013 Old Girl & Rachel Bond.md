Old Girl & Rachel Bond

Today I\'m writing about Old Girl and how she makes a human connection with Rachel, the new girl.

Old Girl had learned the hard way to keep her heart fenced in. You leaked out feelings and pain at your peril around here. Therapists used your leakings in devious ways; her old therapist, who\'d just left the program because she hated Crazey Hazey and wanted to make a living wage, had been unrelenting in her quiet quest to get Old Girl to \"open up.\" You\'re only hurting yourself, she liked to say. No man is an island. She\'d laugh when Old Girl rolled her eyes at the clichés, and she could spin out homilies like breadcrumbs for fun. \"The truth will set you free.\" \"Open your heart and let me in.\" \"Honesty is the best policy.\"

Bull shit. If you got close to anybody, they either ratted you out or they left. The therapist, Lynne, whom she\'d secretly admired, had gone to Seattle, hadn\'t she?

Her new roommate, the tall, lean girl who had the fit during group, was over in her bed pretending to sleep. Every few minutes her hand would snake out from under the covers where she had her head buried and grope around for a Kleenex. So far, Old Girl counted six Kleenex forays.

\"Pretty soon you\'re going to be drowning in snot rags,\" she said to the lump under the covers.

No reaction for a long while. Then Rachel sat up and switched on her bed lamp. Old Girl had been writing a list of stuff she needed to prepare, lighting her notes with her headlamp. The bed lamp revealed Rachel\'s soggy, tearful face. She was busy rooting around in the bed for Kleenex blobs and she dumped them one by one in Old Girl\'s Hello Kitty garbage can.

\"Rough day?\" Old Girl said noncommittally. \"Or do you just like to save your boogers?\"

Rachel smiled a kind of wobbly Charlie Brown smile. \"You must be used to it by now.\"

\"Used to baring your soul and letting people paw through your puke?\" Old Girl inspected her longest dreadlock. \"You sort of get used to it.\"

\"How long have you been here?\" Rachel asked.

Oh fuck. Old Girl wanted to back out of the room. \"Not a good time to reach out and touch someone,\" she muttered. She switched off her headlamp hoping Rachel would get the message that their nascent slumber party was over before it really had begun.

Rachel was looking at her quizzically. \"Reach out and touch someone. Is that a song?\"

\"No, an ad campaign. My mom used to sign the jingle.\"

\"My mom is dead,\" Rachel said.

Oh double fuck and fuck a duck, Old Girl thought. Now what? She considered telling her that she had no mom either but decided against it. It would seem like she was receptive to sharing.

\"I killed mine,\" Old Girl said.

\"What? With your jokes?\"

Old Girl choked on her own spit as she bit back a laugh. \"Quick,\" she said. \"You\'re a smart one.\"

The two girls, one red eyed and sniffling, the other all cried out and closed up like a clam, appraised each other with new appreciation.

\"My mother really is dead,\" Old girl said, feeling something like a hair-like crack in her stony and defended heart when she said the words and sent them out of the darkened corn to the light that was shining on Rachel\'s face.

\"What do you think of James?\" Rachel asked.

The fact that Rachel didn\'t follow up on the news about her mother made Old Girl\'s heart flex a little further in Rachel\'s direction. She\'d never had an experience at Healing House where sharing wasn\'t used as an opportunity to tear a piece of your liver and make you eat it raw. \"He\'s OK. Kind of a jock boy. A hog on the treadmill.\"

\"Can you trust him?\"

Whoo boy howdy. That was not a question you can answer with a straight face.

\"Trust with what? Your virginity?\"

Rachel laughed. \"No, stupid. He seems nice.\"

Everybody seemed nice until you told them something you cared about and then they used it in Group to eviscerate you.

\"How long has he been here?\" Rachel wanted to know.

\"Six months? He came here from wilderness camp, someplace in Bumfuck, Utah.\"

\"Bumfuck, Utah to Bumfuck, Idaho. He\'s made progress.\"

\"It\'s not Idaho. It\'s Udahoe,\" Old Girl said.

\"Udahoe?\"

"U-da-ho for being stupid enough to get locked up here with people just as crazy and fucked up as you are.\"

Rachel though about this for a minute. She seemed comfortable with silence, something that made Old Girl like her. That was the problem with being stuck in a treatment program. Everybody talked non-stop about their problems and after 5 minutes, all you wanted was for them to shut up so you could hear the wind blow.

\"Why do you want to know about James?\" she asked

\"Is he dating Lydia?\"

Old Girl snorted. \"If blow jobs your idea of dating.\"

Rachel tilted her head. She reminded Old Girl of Rodney Dangerfield, her aunt\'s border collie. Rodney was the smarted dog she\'d ever met. You could talk to him and you\'d swear, when he tilted his head in that intelligent way,that he was about to answer.

\"She\'s a sex fiend. Nympho. No personal boundaries. She fucks anything that walks. Well, except for Dr. Hazey because he can\'t get it up.\"

Rachel nodded. \"Hazey\'s kind of smarmy. He said he thought I just need some self-actualization.\"

\"Self-actualization.... That\'s when you actually get to develop a self without being locked up and drugged.

\"Is he a stoner? He did my intake session and he kept slurring his words.\"

\"Everybody\'s a stoner around here. Why not Hazey?\"

\"You\'re full of questions,\" Rachel said, wagging a finger at Old Girl.

\"That\'s because I don\'t have any answers.\"

After that, Rachel snapped off her light. The two girls lay in the silver light of snow reflecting off the moon. Old Girl mashed her pillow into sleeping shape and she heard Rachel doing the same. She drifted off to sleep with the sound of her new roommate breathing. A surprisingly companionable sound.

Next scenes to write.

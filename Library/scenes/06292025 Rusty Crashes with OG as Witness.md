06282025 Rusty Crashes and OG Watches Him Die

END OF PART 1 (TODAY)

OG ESCAPES

2:13 AM

OLD GIRL[']{dir="rtl"}S BOOTS CRUNCH ALONG for the first few miles on her escape from Healing House.

Strenger Road had been snowplowed a few hours before. A light dusting of snow, just an inch or two, covers the churned ruts. As far as Old Girl can see, a silver ribbon of white snakes through dark trees and rolling hills pointing her way south-east to I-90. To freedom. A few inches of newly fallen snow over the plowed surface looks deceptively smooth. Underneath, her jackboots crunch through stiff snow and muck and hard crust that covers a layer of ice slick enough to skate on.

Even on the first mile of flats, one or the other boot slides out from under her. She finds herself constantly flailing and windmilling to stay upright. By the second mile, she perfects a kind of sliding gait. It involves stepping and gliding and making sure not to pick up her heels. As long as she stays connected to the surface, gravity can[']{dir="rtl"}t take over.

She[']{dir="rtl"}s descending the steep hill that the locals call Harrow Hill when she falls painfully hard at the halfway point. She[']{dir="rtl"}d abandoned the skating stride in favor of duckwalking the steep slope with small mincing steps while she fought the slick surface under the hard pack. One boot whipped out from under her and the next thing she knew, she was lying like an overturned beetle on her Hello Kitty back pack.

For a moment, she lies flat on her back in the empty road. Her brain rings like an alarm clock waking her up to pain. A milky wash of stars overhead shines bright as fireflies and the shrillness of the starlight hurts her eyes. Under the throb in her skull and the ache of a banged elbow, the ice under her body is freezing cold, unforgiving and chill as granite. She thinks longingly of her bed back at Healing House, of the soft flannel sheets, and thick woolen blankets. She[']{dir="rtl"}s wishing she was still curled up in them, listening to Rachel breathe in soft susurrations in the bed across from her. She doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t like to admit it, but she liked hearing the sound of another human in the darkness. Knowing she wasn't separated from the world of the living felt good since it had been so long since that was normal.

At this rate, it will take her two hours, maybe three, to get to Wolf Road where she has a tiny chance of hitching a ride to I-90. Then she[']{dir="rtl"}ll have to hope she can catch one of the big trucks hauling loads to Seattle. She feels like crying because she[']{dir="rtl"}s hurt and she[']{dir="rtl"}s starting to feel cold. She[']{dir="rtl"}s so tired. Mortally tired.

That[']{dir="rtl"}s when the low rumble of an approaching engine reaches her ears. It[']{dir="rtl"}s distant and far away. It[']{dir="rtl"}s coming from the direction of the dump which is odd because there[']{dir="rtl"}s nothing past the dump except Healing House.

The ruts in her mind take their usual leap away from the trouble it takes to stay alive and they take their wellborn path to the quickest and easiest way to die.

She shrugs quickly out of her pack and dumps it in the road. She half slips, half-slides down hill to a blue-dark shadow at the bottom where there's a dip. Tall Ponderosas loom over the road beyond her to the sharp curve left. He won[']{dir="rtl"}t see me here, she thinks. Then she amends that thought to, even if he sees me, he won[']{dir="rtl"}t be able to stop.

BEGINNING OF TOMORROW (PART 3)

COYOTE

3:55 AM

LEAVING BEHIND THE WAKING KITS AND THEIR WHINES, a coyote pads her usual trail. Laps at the black water of the slow-running creek. Then skirts the edge of dark trees, pads across an open meadow, and climbs up a hill toward the noise and death road. Shadows. Mostly silence in the time of predators on the hunt.

She smells a far distant vole, hidden deep under snow, safe in its subterranean nest. Her stomach rumbles, reminding her of A growing pinch, the cries of hungry kits a mile distant from the rush and tumult of the river in her blood.

She edges around the grove and climbs the snowy slope, swinging her muzzle side to side, gathering in familiar smells of cheat grass and vetch and bitter brush and aspen under the snow along the road. Snow-snapped pine boughs release resin smells. A faint tinge of smoke and machines that register as past, not present dangers.

On a freshening breeze, an interesting smell tantalizes her --- something promising enough to make her pause before stepping onto the death road. Something foreign, edible, maybe meat, that she half remembers smelling on a trot behind a lighted place with barrels that were easy to nudge off.

She pads further down the road to investigate. She's curiosity-killed-the-coyote wary. Ready to turn and flee, she smells with a sharp intake of breath. There's a dark shape in the road that wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t there on her dawn hunt. Alive? Not moving. No forest creature. A slight furze of sulfur breath rises and hovers a few inches above its dark head, as if it\'s trying to hide itself in a small fog of life.

The coyote is drawn against her wariness by the smell from the lump next to the unfamiliar shoe. Something \-- meat? cheese?\-- is near and she salivates though she knows whatever is in the road might not want to give it up.

Torn between the desire to come closer and fearful of the unknown smell not unlike something almost dead, the coyote creeps closer. She nuzzles at the delicious smell coming from the small lump and nips at it with sharp fangs. It's a bite and a jerk to steal it away from the bigger lump that's already getting to its feet and making ay-ay-ay sounds that would scare her if she wasn't so hungry.

The naked thing with the stink never ceases to amaze her. It starts throwing something at her that smells like food mixed with air.

There's a standoff. Mother coyote has her teeth in the better smelling lump. She knows in her stomach that whatever's in there will feed her and her kits better than whatever the stinky one was throwing.

Then the sky is lit up by unnatural brightness.

The roar of death.

The coyote springs from the death road over the snow bank and lopes as fast as she can fly when noise tears the night.

Rusty POV Before the Crash

**4:33 AM**

THE SIX-PACK OF BEER RUSTY HAS BEEN DRINKING is five down, One Rainier left, in a nest of plastic rings. He pats at his breast pocket. Feels for the key, then the zip ties he\'s stashed there. The container is fitted with handcuffs. The new blanket still in its wrapper. Everything is in the bag but the baby. And she's not far down the road at Dr. Hazey's.

Steering with one knee, he fumbles for the last beer, grappling at the plastic ring with two hands. He[']{dir="rtl"}s thinking maybe he ought circle around back to 7-Eleven for another six-back, or should he do it after? He might be too excited.

Red eyes freeze in the true's high beams. A unearthly feral glow. Darkness made darker by the startlement of red.

Dog? Wolf? Fucking coyote? The overloaded garbage truck is already shimmying an swaying. A front wheel catches on a deep, icy rut.. He busy wrestling the left-pulling steering wheel, trying to heave the weight around without touching the brake, with one finger still stuck in the pull tab of the beer. The heavy and high weight of a full load of trash picks up speed on the downslope with all its gravity a behind it. He remembers the hard left when the truck lifts off. He's flying in the air as the truck launches itself at the looming Ponderosas.

The last thing Rusty sees are his hands thrown up to protect his face from wall of yellow bark coming at him.

OG WATCHES RUSTY DIE

OPENING OF TOMORROW (PART 3)

OG and the coyote seem to be at a stand-off, until OG rememberesthe half-full Cheeto bag she'd stolen from Charlene back at Healing House.

The coyote's incisors are embedded in the back pack strap, as if it isn[']{dir="rtl"}t about to let it go without a fight to the death. It's crouched on all fours, belly to the ground, showing pink teats that are distended and thin. Kits, OG thinks with dismay. She needs to eat to feed her kits.

OG stills for a long minute, then pulls off a glove as the creature's yellow eyes track her movements. One ear rotate towards the sound of crinkling as she teases the Cheeto bag out of her pocket with numb fingers.

Her first try is an under hand of a cheese curl between the coyote's paws which makes the creature lift off vertically and hop backwards like a live spring. Moonlight yellow glints ias it cuts its eyes toward a puff, but after that, the coyote refused to look at any of the cheese curls that OG launches.

"They're good." OG tries for a low, conversational tone. "Charlene thinks so. She's the reason I don't have that many left." A third and then a fourth puff are ignored, though both of them sail in front of a quivering nose. The coyote regally ignores the treats and maintains a sphinx-like gaze as if she had the patience of eternity.

OG is seven or eight Cheeto tosses in, before she became aware of a distant engine noise coming from the direction of Inner Horizons.

For the briefest instant, OG has the impression of head lights sweeping back and forth like a trouble light. Old Girl senses more than sees a dark, speeding mass whoosh overhead. A frigid gust of wind like an enormous wave crashes over her. The dark shape hurtles so close, engine heat and diesel fumes and rot envelop her.

A tremendous crash splits the night.

A metallic creak and whang.

The tinkle of breaking glass.

Old Girl brushes at her face in astonishment. She wipes away shards of ice and wetness and road grit grit as if someone has throw a shovelful of slush in her face. Inches from the soles of her boots is a huge tire tread of pushed up, granulated snow. The tread swerves past her and follows the slope a few feet, before it angles along the gutter of the mounded snow berm left by the plow. It follows the snow berm on a straight unerring path till it reaches the bottom and disappears in a grove of shadowy trees.

She is up and on her feet, slipping and sliding down hill, smelling a strong sweetish smell of caramel, the smell that releases when you peel a puzzle shaped piece of bark from a Ponderosa pine. She has to clamber and stagger up and over the head-high plowed snow mound and follow a swerving path of two wheeled destruction and mangled branches before she finds the site of the crash.

She stands agape, disbelieving what her mind is telling her eyes to believe.

A large, still churning and humming truck is trying to drive up one the Ponderosas on a direct path, it seems, to the stars.

The truck stands vertically on its back end, its bed and tail gate embedded in the snow. Rear wheels churn and smoke, throwing up snow and spitting slush. The pine has been split nearly in half and the broken part of it stabs the sky with bent spars of yellow heart wood. The truck leans its weight on the tree, front wheels spinning without friction on either side of the trunk.

As Old Girl gapes, the truck begins a slow lean--- the headlights shining up into a a dark canopy of branches rakes the adjoining forest--- and then the chassis slips in a kind of walking slide a short distance around the trunk and whumpfs over on its side with a bang. Springs whinge. Creak. Sigh.

As if to signal that the impossible trip to the sky is over, the engine quits.

All is silence while a small explosion of free snowflakes swirl in front of the headlamps.

Old Girl plunges through deep snow trying to reachthe passenger side door. Since the truck lies on its side, the door is on top of the truck so she has to climb up finding toe holds in the undercarriage where she can. All she can see through the side window is a dark hunched human form leaning forward with arms protectively hugging the steering wheel.

No luck yanking the bent door open.

The glass of the windshield is cracked and crazed but still holding together. She crawls over the smashed-in hood and starts kicking at the broken glass,. She uses the heels of her boots to break out the icici-like shards clinging to the rubber molding like jagged teeth.

["]{dir="rtl"}Are you hurt? Can you talk?" she calls through the enlarging hole. She smells an unidentifiable reek. A top note of diesel fumes. It takes work to kick a hole in the glass big enough to crawl through and she has to brush at the glass with her gloves and poke hard with her elbows to clear an entrance. Finally she just wiggles into the jagged hole backwards, using her butt to kick aside the glass. A gymnastic eel turn and shimmy deposits her in the front seat that has become a weirdly narrow space between the dashboard and the back of the cab.

Paper bags. A tangle of ropes. Hamburger wrappers. Old McDonalds French fry cartons. Styrofoam cups. A hammer. A screwdriver sticking out of the dash.. Some weird doll toy on the floor.

It takes a second to understand why the space is so cramped. The engine, normally under the hood, has been driven forward into the cab. The steering column is resting against the chest of the man at the wheel. He isn[']{dir="rtl"}t hugging the wheel. He\'s leaning forward with his arms wrapped around it, because the steel column is embedded in his chest.

\"Holy shit.\" She breathes in the wet copper penny smell of blood. Takes in the dark jacket with neon sleeves, the firefighter hem that glows faintly in the reflected light of an ancient dash. To her astonishment, the driver opens dark eyes and he turns his face towards her. He\'s looking at her with a puzzled expression.

\"Are you OK?\" she ask again. The absurdity of the question\--for Christ\'s sake he's got a steering column in his chest!---propels her closer so she can feel gingerly around his chest cavity to see if she[']{dir="rtl"}s mistaken. One headlight stares crazily out at the forest and reflects enough light into the cab to reveal the the man\'s banged up forehead, a bleeding nose.

Dark, black stickiness seeps from the vicinity of the column. At first she thinks its oil but when she sees it turning his chest into a dark wet cave, she knows its blood.

\"Who are you? he wants to know.

For the first time since she entered treatment, Old Girl answers without thinking. ["]{dir="rtl"}Angela. My name is Angela." What[']{dir="rtl"}s the point of going into chapter and verse with a mortally injured man about a stupid nickname?

["]{dir="rtl"}Pretty." His voice is raspy and faint.

The man reeks with filth. He[']{dir="rtl"}s middle-aged, Unshaven face. Dark hair stiff with grease. He waves his hand vaguely at the steering column. ["]{dir="rtl"}Stuck,\" he says. ["]{dir="rtl"}Can[']{dir="rtl"}t move.\"

Now it dawns on Old Girl then that the dark flow dripping quietly on the floor mat is coming from the man[']{dir="rtl"}s chest not the steering column.

["]{dir="rtl"}I should get help." She has a desperate desire to scramble out of the truck, away from an injury she has no idea how to deal with, but honestly, the only help she can think of is too far away at Healing House. It[']{dir="rtl"}ll take her hours he doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t have to make it there and back.

Besides, he is already gripping her hand between dark, wet fingers. For a man with a steering column embedded in his chest, he\'s got a grip like a tree root strong enough to break stone. His expression is intense with longing. ["]{dir="rtl"}Don[']{dir="rtl"}t leave me."

"You have to stay awake." Old Girl knows it sounds stupid but she's thinking about something she read about not allowing a person with a concussion to fall asleep, a useless fact that\'s stuck in her head with a lot of other worthless information --- Latin declensions! that don't include even the basics of first aid.

He murmurs into the silence. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s not fair."

Old Girl nods, in complete agreement. Life isn\'t fair. She doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t have a steering column sticking out of her chest, for example, when she[']{dir="rtl"}s the one who offered her body up in the middle of a snowy road expecting death to find her. Instead, death circles this lonely, stinking man so close she can almost feel its wings.

["]{dir="rtl"}Shhhh." She squeezes his hand gently and counts his thready pulse. Is it multiply by 6 for 10 seconds or is it count the beats for 10 seconds and divide by 6? She stops because even an idiot can tell that his pulse is racing like a clock that[']{dir="rtl"}s running out of time. The drops that continue to drip from the column bead plink and plunk but it's only a little while until they start to hang for longer and longer pauses before they plop to the floor. \"Who knew that he hath so much blood in him." Macbeth intones with a voice of doom. Now she wishes she\'d paid less attention to Shakespear and more attention in First Aid and Home Accident Prevention that Aung Peggy insisted she take But even if she had, would the instructions have covered the contents of an entire heart seeping out a man's body while he's holding her hand within a death grip?

About the time it occurs to her that this really is a death grip, she perceives a slight relaxation of his fingers as if he\'s drifting away from whatever tethers him to the world.

["]{dir="rtl"}Stay with me," she says. He makes an ineffectual movement to push away the steering wheel. Raises one shoulder, as if he[']{dir="rtl"}s trying to be philosophical, and says, ["]{dir="rtl"}What are you going to do about it?"

The last thing he says, after brushing restlessly at his chest, is, ["]{dir="rtl"}Always rain. Never any goddamned sun."

Something feels enormous.

Ever after she will remember this moment, not her first experience of death but her first experience in the presence of death. The only time that will come close to the enormity of this feeling is many years later, during the birth of a baby that is so far from conception that it might well be one of the stars scattered like diamond dust across the night-black sky.

His breathing changes. It goes from quick and raspy to a long wheezy inhalation. An interminable silence lengthens before his mouth opens to breathe again. He is no longer gripping her in fear and terror that she will leave. Somehow she is the one gripping him.

She is doing her best to keep him with her, though her strong and youthful grip is weak and paltry in the face of the force that has him in its grip.

Would she have hung around for Mom and Dad? Gabe? Absolutely, she thinks, if it would have kept them alive. What about David and Peggy, the people who stepped up after death erased her family and folded her into their lives without question? Does she owe them some connection to this earth?

The weird thing, she realizes, about this small, encapsulated world in the greasy man[']{dir="rtl"}s truck is how anchored she feels to it. He needs her. He wants her to stay. For perhaps the first time in her life, she herself wants---feels duty-bound, in fact\-- to stay to hold onto another human being. It is a revelation among the hamburger wrappers and Chicken McNuggets and French fry cartons, all the throwaways that have sustained this stranger[']{dir="rtl"}s throwaway life, to realize she can[']{dir="rtl"}t bear to have this life thrown away now.

His jaw opens and closes twice like a fish without water. Then it opens like a drawbridge. His color, when she climbed in the windshield, was ruddy with life. Now his lips are bluish. The tip of his nose is dusky blue.

In the moment of recognition that the power has switched off, she holds tight to the man[']{dir="rtl"}s hand, willing the warmth of her own blood and life into his relaxed, now cooling fingers. A vast longing steals over her. She would give anything to turn back the hands of the clock, to turn back time to the moment when his eyes greeted her with surprise when she entered the cab and gleamed at her with flinty life.

It is easier this time to come out of the cab feet first, reversing her direction from the way she came in, as if she\'s squirming out of a birth canal. She kick-steps a trail up the mounded snow berm and makes her way back to the road feeling new blood pulsing in her feet, the pain like ice crystals tumbling and tearing her veins.

The silver snow light feels colder. A few snow flakes sift down from pine branches scattered by the crash.

A strange half human-half crab monster she found on the floor of the cab nestles in her pack. It has a shaving brush for a head with large goggle eyes mounted to the handle. No mouth. A unicorn-sharp shell is glued on a penis. Its arms are mismatched doll parts, one brown, the other pink, while its bottom half, naked as a newborn, has legs that end in claws. She keeps it hoping to sell it but wonders who would be crazy enough to buy it?

It's almost four. Her plan is to thumb a ride with the Smith Milk lady to I-90, then hitch to Seattle, where she intends to ask Eleanor, her dad[']{dir="rtl"}s sister, now a professor in literature at the University of Washington, to help her get back into school.

She[']{dir="rtl"}s wanted to die for so long, it is hard to imagine what it will take to direct her life toward the problems of living. Instead of blowing her nose and wishing she could blow her brains out, she now has to think about where to find a Kleenex. Maybe the truck driver who picks her up will have a box hidden between the seats so she can blow her nose. Or maybe she should use her sleeve. Maybe she should just stop by a McDonald's and steal some napkins.

A whole world of possibilities opens up when you are thinking about how to live your life instead of ending it, she thinks.

Meanwhile, she begins to trudge along, seeing dawn lift the blackness from the night sky and turn it to an intense night blue. She feels life, painful and fiery as live coals, rush in to her frozen toes.

FINAL SCENE

TOMORROW (PART 3)

Just started editing, so this is for next deadline, Kerry.

A mile or down the road from the crash, a friendly man in a Pleasant Pastures truck picked her up. The milk man, under many layers of scarf, earflaps, hat, giant mittens and a floor-length down coat, turned out to be a milk lady -- something OG figured out by the high pitched quaver in the woman[']{dir="rtl"}s voice when she asked her what she was doing out in the middle of the night?

OG lied. Said her car broke down for the early shift at McDonald[']{dir="rtl"}s. The milk lady, a rural Idahoan of indeterminate generations, obligingly dropped her off at the Arches which were located near the on-ramp to I-90 west bound.

OG listens to Carly chatter and natter on about the truck driving life. Exciting places like Duluth! Peoria! Dollyville! How great it is to always know where her husband is--- here, she pat-pat-pats Ken's big silent knee--- "because he's right here."

At that moment, the Western Star rig chugs past a sign for the Idaho state line. It's a normal green metal highway sign but in OG's mind, she's seeing another older, weathered sign that looked like it had been cut out of the back of a woodshed in the shape of the state of Idaho. It had a chipper "Welcome to the Land of Howdy!" Message and it was sticking out of a thicket of weeds the day Uncle David and Aunt Peggy were dropping her off at Inner Horizons.

By that point in the 1300 mile trip, she hadn't said a word for hundreds of miles. All that she can remember thinking was how much she wanted to under that sign, not looking at it.

"Look, Angie, we're almost there," Aunt Peggy said brightly, "Only 74 miles to go."

Miles to go before I sleep/in woods snowy dark and deep" is how she's been misquoting Frost for almost 1,300 miles as if freezing to death was the only thing to look forward to.

"The Idaho sign looks like a big bear came out of the woods and chomped it off at the top, she said to Clary, who was fortifying herself with another donut before going deep into an explanation of the risk of hemorrhoids for long distance truckers.

"I would have thought accidents were a bigger risk," OG said.

"Oh, no, honey. Piles are the worst. Seriously, you can't imagine how hard it is to not be able to sit on your butt with this kind of job. Show her your whoopee cushion, Ken. It's a life saver."

"I'm driving, honey." Ken's eyes stayed on the road but when Carly wasn't looking, he shot a grin at OG, saying plenty about the life of a married long distance trucker for all those miles of nothing.

Thel Idaho line sign receded to a green dot in far distance by the time OG realized that old Youdaho was behind her and Washington, hopefully her new home with Aunt Ellen was up ahead.

"My name is really Angela," she said. "They used to call me OG but Angela is the name Mom and Dad gave me." Might as well start as she meant to go on, something Mom used to say, but she didn't understand until she finally admitted she was a new Angela in an older-than-Methuselah body.

CRASH

The blue night was cold but not unbearable, now that she was up and moving. Moonlight silvered the ice on the road where the coyote lay, one ear cocked to the low rumble of an unmuffled engine. Clinks and rattles accompanied the dull roar increasing in the distance, and it seemed as if the vehicle was laboring up the back of the hill OG had worked her way up and had carefully picked her way down wishing she had metal spikes to keep her from falling.

A glow like dawn rose at the hill crest. The rumble deepened as empty yellow orbs emerged from the glow and resolved into headlights. She expected the lights to creep slowly down the steep slope, but weirdly they bounced and jounced as the vehicle sped up as it came came roaring down the hill to a wide curve at the bottom that made a hard left with about a million arrows of warning that screamed "Slow down! Danger!"

The coyote was up and leaping over the snow berm piled high by the snow plow and loping toward a grove of tall Ponderosas lining the road, before OG could convince her own feet to move.

Following the coyotes flight, OG ran for the snow berm. She had one foot on the up slope when a dark jingling, clanking mass whizzed over head, so close to her that if she'd winged out an elbow, her arm would have been shaved off at at the pit. A frigidwind flung her ear flaps straight up as she watched in amazement as a massive truck flew over with all four wheels spinning in the air.

SHHHhh-WANNGGGG!

The sound louder than a bomb exploding broke the silence of the night.

A simultaneous CRAAAACCCCKKK split an eighty-foot tree down to a gold blaze of heartwood.

THWWWWUMPPP.

An avalanche of disturbed snow from the upper branches buried the truck, the tree trunk and its presumably its driver in a flurry of white sound and fury.

It took years before OG would be able to turn off the vision of the mad black truck continuing its mad flight upward so that the truck appeared to drive itself straight up one of the tall Ponderosa trees, shearing off bark and branches as it climbed. For one elongated second, its dark bulk teetered and creaked as it hung suspended between earth and sky. It was an impossibly long moment before gravity reasserted its bonds. Then the truck slipped slowly, almost decorously sideways, turning with a scream of its undercarriage, around the bole of the tree. It landed upright on four wheel still spinning with a WHUMPF. The engine continued to surge.

MOMENT AFTER RUSTY'S DEATH

In the ticking, cooling truck, holding the man's once warm, now rapidly cooling hand, OG feels sleepy. The cold from the open windshield has stolen over her. In this hypnogogic mind, she's moving toward any warmth and it feels like she\'s back in the entryway of Healing House the day she was burning up with fever. OG is making her shaky way to the entry way, holding onto the wall, in order to see why all the sirens were wailing in her head.

Two Burley EMT guys are wheeling a body of someone she\'s never met to a waiting ambulance. She hears one of the EMTs s say they are heading to the morgue. In her fever dreams, it was Gabe who was screaming but it wasn\'t Gabe who needed help in the entry way. Nor was it the kid she never met who died in Margaret\'s arms and whose body she saw being wrestled into a white bag until it erased him completely. Margaret was the one whose unglued pieces are flying all around the room ---exactly the way OG felt when the police arrived with the news that her family, every last one of them -- had died.

Margaret was babbling, alternately crying and moaning about how the new kid had been fine 10 minutes ago. She'd rolled him on his back. Beat the shit out of him with chest compressions! She wailed in the breathy high voice of Gabe's, \"He wouldn\'t come back, goddamnit! I even slapped him."OG, to her ever living gratitude, once again felt Margaret\'s warm breath against her cheek, while her dreadlocks were buried in the crook of the big woman's neck. The pillowy Double-DD breasts, so unlike her own mother's willowy small frame, comforted her with maternal softness and solidity and an awareness of suffering from loss. Loss---the only word OG could come up with to describe how those breast felt though they were big as life, and they did their magic a second time by pulling her away from the cold in the cooling truck to look for human warmth.

The last thing OG did, after climbing up and over the berm, was to unwrap the ham-and-cheese sandwich Margaret had left for her lunch. She opened the sandwich and laid a slice of cheese glistening with mayonnaise next to the other side that was piled with mustard and ham. It was protected with Margaret's saran wrap, so hopefully the mother coyote, wherever it was lurking in the trees would smell the dinner that would feed its kits.

The driver of the garbage truck was gone. Life went on. She had to go on. The hard lesson she learned at Inner Horizons, and many times after, as life went on: You had to go on though you never knew where you were going.

"I wouldn't feed Cheetos to my kids either."

"So how come you're eating them?"

"You kids are still growing. I figure I'm too old to worry about it." Margaret's moving hands and the focused look on her kindly face imprinted themselves on OG just as she tossed a cheese curl in the air and caught it with her mouth like a dog snapping up a bee. "There you go, honey," she said, dusting orange dusty off her hands and handing OG the sandwich from her own lunch.

"Eat it later on when you're hungry.'

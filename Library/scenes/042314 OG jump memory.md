4/23/14 Old Girl's Jump memory

Still struggling to assimilate my judgmental reaction to Nicole Hardy Saturday. I\'ve moved further on the continuum so that I watched and judged her failures as a teacher without acting out in class. I saw my own disgust snuck a strong ward for a woman who is \_\_\_\_ and young and wounded, but it took me a while to find my humanity. My irritation at her self-absorption and her lack of intuition for the struggling writers bugged me. Just as Carla\'s self-absorption and inability to act for others used to bug me too.

It was not my class. Not my responsibility to help get the other writers unstuck though I was very aware of their angst and anxieties. I\'ve become a teacher aware of the emotions in the room of students so it\'s familiar to me as the responsibility of being a teacher. Nicole, who is young--well early 40s or late 30? -- isn\'t.

Is this intolerance of self-absorption something to \_\_ for the Idaho novel. It\'s in Margaret who has been programmed to do for others which is mom being channeled from pre-history.

I want to warm up Old Girl and make her compulsion to kill herself both understandable and sympathetic. I want the reader to root for her not to be distanced from her even though most people aren\'t\' burden with the compulsion like Susan is.

One of Old Girl\'s most vivid memories was of climbing a live oak tree. She was seven, maybe eight, and she was playing hike-and-seek with her cousins at their farm in Ohio. Esther her favorite girl cousin was *it* and Old Girl shinnied up the rough bark of the tree that sheltered the house and then clambered from limb to limb while she could hear Ester chanting numbers to a hundred. All the other kids ran to the barn or hid behind the pigsty or the root cellar stairs. From high above the farm, she could see them all scatter to the winds and hanker down out of sight from what felt like a thousand feet up. She watched Esther, a blond girl in a bowl hair cut, counting with her eyes covered and she felt like she was a million miles from every living thing. The ground looked far away. The kids looked small and grub-like in their curled up hiding places and it seems like no one was aware she was far above them. So far, in fact, she could let go of the branch she was holding on to and surprise them all by falling like a stone.

The idea of falling seemed to take her over and grow larger the longer she let it stay in her consciousness. \"Let go,\" she heard a command in her ear.

\"Just let yourself go.\"

It was like being pulled toward something dark and dangerous but somehow so seductive she had to grip the bark and feel it\'s bite in her palms before she was able to stop herself from falling.

And that was before mom and dad and Gabe were taken from her.

Susan Eliza said when she was diagnosed with cancer, her first thought was \"Oh thank God! At last I\'ll be at peace.\"

I remember looking at her with amazement. She wanted to die? \"At least I wouldn\'t hurt,\" she said. \"There\'d be an end to it.\"

[Fire scene]{.underline}

Raccoons in the trees:

The flames crackled and orange-red light flared where the fire had broken the roof. Firemen were silhouetted against the orange light behind them.

Behind her, Rachel heard someone say, \"Jesus what is that?\"

She turned and a black masked feral face seemed to bloom from a neon pink flower at the top of a ponderosa pine. What the hell?

A firefighter aimed a flashlight higher in the tree. A Day-Glo, yellow bloom glowed farther up in the same tree with another feral masked face.

\"Raccoons,\" someone breathed.

\"Holy Christ!?\"

More lights flickered on and the black branches lit up with half a dozen neon bursts in the clump of pines closet to Healing House. Day-Glo orange, sunburst yellow, a fluorescent green never seen in nature-- and in the middle, like the black centers of Michelmas daisies shone the beady-eyed bandit masked faces of a dozen raccoons.

\"What\'s wrong with them?\" somebody said.

\"Who the hell painted them?\"

Margaret, the only one among them who knew where the paintball paint had come from, was sound asleep in her flannel sheets next to the thunderous snores of her husband Hank.

Rachel shrugged her shoulders in the blanket James had wrapped around her. It would take more than she had in her to explain Hazey\'s war on the garbage eaters. so she didn\'t even try.

It seemed though, as if the starbursts of strange blooms with masks faces imprinted itself on her brain cells. Even after, she would remember the orange light of the flames and the play of the searching flashlights against a black open sky. The stars winked on like neon anemones in a dark sea, then winked out once the lights passed by like an miracle no one expected but would never forget.

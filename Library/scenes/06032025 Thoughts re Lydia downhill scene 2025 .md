06032025 Thoughts re Lydia downhill scene

"Those tires are killer looking but stupid in snow," Frankie said. "They're mud tires, not snow tires. Not that you heard it from me1."

Jed-Ned was the kind of guy who bought the most expensive truck with the most expensive package of extra to make him look good but the irony was that alll the money he threw around just made him look stupid. Why would you buy the premier offloading vehicle in the world and not like getting it dirty?

It didn't take Lyda more than one or two interactions with Jed/Ned to realize he wasn't that sharp. But since she was most interested in the size of his wallet, what were a few missing brain cells. She had hopped up on the running board and taken another hop into the cab and felt the butter-soft leather under her butt and that was all she needed to know about his ability to pay for her blow jobs. This was commerce, not love, or even liking.

The cowboy also had an annoying habit of putting his Stetson over his lap when she went down on him which both blinded her and made it hard to breathe. She couldn't figure out why he covered her up because having a big ass cowboy hat rocking in his lap wasn't exactly hard to interpret. Whatever.

"Everybody knew Ned and his "bangin'" truck F. Especially with its custom paint job with flames spurting out of the back end and red and white LED lights under the lift package so it looks like it can levitate six feet off the ground. That day she'd misheard his name as Jed (that damned Stetson) he'd told her he didn't have to all her to tell her he was coming. You could hear the tires chewing up the asphalt (and his gas mileage) from as far away as Jersey.

Another time, early in their relationship (translation: first paying blowjob), she casually says, "Nice ride" as she's getting into the cab. She thought he'd never shut up about the primo tow and haul spec and and Nitto Grapplers vs. Grabber tires and the special lug nuts on the custom hubs that were recited chapter-and-verse. When he handed over 3 twenties she thought about adding a lug nut task but saved it for the next "date" he booked.

The night Jed drives Frankie and Lydia to the Shooting Range back in the hills surrounding Coeur D'Alene Lake, Jed is torn between wanting to show off how the Raptor can fly with not wanting to get it dirty since he just had it detailed and steam cleaned the undercarriage and he hates it when the mud cakes on the LED ights and fucks up the way the lift package makes it look like a UFO that can levitate 5' off the ground.

At one point, when she moaned from the back seat from the pain of his pistol whipping Jed said he's sorry he didn't buy the Rivien. "We coulda stuffed her in the cross cab storage compartment tand wouldn't-a heard a thing."

06042025 Driving up to the Shooting Range in the Rapport with Jed

"I don't get my trust check till next week and I don't want to drive around if it's pigged out." His voice had a whining edge that wasn't 't noticeable when all he was capable of saying was "Harder!!" and "Yeah, right there!"

"What check?" Frankie asked. The novelty of receiving a regular check for nothing when he was sweating every month to make rent interrupts the ongoing argument about whether the factory-spec K02/03 tires looked ass or pussy.

"It's a spud check. IIt's where us Simplot got our money."

"Every goddamn month you get a check?"

"L clockwork.." Jed swigs deeply from the bottle Frank passes likes its Gatorade.

"What's a Spud Head?" Frankie drinks just not as long.

Lydia immediately knows Jed is talking about his trust fund because she had one too, though her mom still calls it an "allowance." She alternately likes having it to pay for the newest Prada bag but talking to Lorenza has made her wonder if it gets in the way of her being able to stand on her own two feet.

"Why'd you buy an off-roader if you don't like taking it off road then? You shoulda sprung for the Lamborghini."

Jed stiff armed Frankie with a closed fist, a quick, mean job that landed with a thump ad a yowl. "Shut your pie hole. How I spend my money's none of your look out."

"Fuck," Frankie said, wiping at his face and neck which were running with Jack Daniels. "Look what you made me do, duffs You spilt the Jack." The amber bottle was lit by the lights of oncoming headlights which were fewer and farther between, now that they'd turned off the main road. \"It's almost shot."

This time Jed's fist struck Frankie's bicep. "Fuck for brains! Don't get us stopped for DWI. " He jerked his thumb toward Lydia who was trussed up like a turkey with her arms zipped behind her back, and one shoulder painfully wrenched under the other. "Besides, how'd we explain her?"

Jed reached through the gap between the front seats and pulled her hair. "Ha! We got plans for you, honey. You're the entertainment!" He pinched her boob and said, "So where's your fates friend now? Her and her fucking purse! She's not going to be able to help you tonight, is she?"

Lydia's stomach, none too shady, sank at the mention of Margaret an the reason for Jed's rage. It turned over in a nauseating loop when he yanked the wheel viciously right and turned uphill as the back end of the truck fishtailed ad swerved near the road's edge.

"I passed her on '90 on my way to pick you up. The bitch was going the speed limit and I flipped her off."

His drunken laugh, high pitched and unhinged, rose up against the truck's expensive quiet. She'd never been more frightened in her life.

They days were still short. Dark came early. It had been around 5 when Jed answered his Motörhead friend, Frankie, Disappeared in a bar on the way East. Jed ha thrown a dusty moving blanket over her boy, presumably to cover her p from prying eyes because she was trussed up like a turkey. When she heard noise outside the truck, she tried moving around and managed to dislodge the quilted fabric from her head and shoulders but as time lingered on and full dark descended, she wishes she hand't dislodged the only way to keep warm.

Maybe she slept --- her ear where he'd slapped her was aching --- and now she had a headache from getting banged around when she fought against getting locked int he back seat of the ab. Her hands were numb, except where the crfueely-tightened zip ties cut into the flesh of her wrists.

She woke up with her mouth dry and her shoulders aching to Jed and Frankie snorting lines off her sociology text book and laughing like hyenas. Both of them were high and they smelled like they'd been bathing in bourbon. All concern for the truck ---and by extension her--- had been swallowed up with the drinks they'd consumed at the AmVets Club.

"Lemme get her out," Jed slurred. "Time for a blow job."

Frank, long hair standing on ending, looked surprise to see her, like he'd forgotten she was along for the ride. "Let's get rid of her," he said. "Let her walk home and we'll go up to the Shooting Range. That's what you said in the Bar." He sounded like a petulant child who'd been promised a lollipop that was being withheld.

"Oh, we'll be shooting all right." Jed laughed uproariously and started the engine with its rumbling growl. "She's the target!"

After that, Lydia lost count of how many sickening turns they made going uphill and deeper into the hills above Lake Couer D'Alene. Before they'd turned North off the highway, an occasional flash of headlights from an oncoming car had reminded her that the outside world still existed. Once the Raptor engine downshifted into a low laboring gear they continued to fishtail upward and climbed into purple darkness that felt heavy and went on forever.

Jed tossed her into a pool of blue moonlit snow. She landed on her back like an overturned beetle and discovered she couldn't feel her hands or her feet which were locked behind her5.

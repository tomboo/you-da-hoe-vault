Lydia Gets a Job

Lydia had passed the 9 mo. mark. Theoretically you spent the first 3 months in hell where they acted like they had you on an ankle wire and kept you trapped in an endless cycle of individual therapy, group therapy and \"reflection time\" where you were supposed to be thinking about your sorry self without the diversion of TV or video games or even music.

Frankly, the alone time was almost more than she could bear, which was how she tries to escape the 1^st^ time. Her reflections had led her to walk out the back door when Gretchen had her back turned and she rode shotgun on the bumper of the Smith Brothers milk truck with the driver blissfully unaware she was freezing her ass off during his frequent stops where she had to crouch down behind a tree so he couldn\'t see her and then run like hell and clamber on the bumper when he took off. She made it to E. Coeur d'Alene and had the bad luck to be spotted by state cop who gave the Smith Brothers guy a ticket and drove her back to the program, where they\'d already issued an APB. That meant she had to suffer another 2 months of Intensive.

At the six months mark, they finally loosened the leash and let her sign up at North Idaho Community College for classes. If you proved you could go to class without running and show up on time and do the asinine homework assignments, the next \"privilege\" was to do community service at your choice of \"approved\" non-profits.

When she met Lorenzo, she got motivated to sign up for an interview at the Povarello Center. Given a choice between bagging groceries at the Pend O\'reille Food Bank or cleaning toilets at the homeless center, she couldn\'t believe she was sitting in the threadbare lobby of the Povarello Center waiting for the Head of Housekeeping.

She hadn\'t seen Lorenzo for almost a week. No-show at the Student Union. No sign of him in Business Math, which was only tolerable because she sat behind him and could watch him taking careful notes.

She hoped Clary Ziemkowski, Head of Housekeeping, wasn\'t a female. She could wrap any man around her finger but it wasn\'t so easy with a woman. Margaret, for example, had her number. Pray for something with a dick, she was thinking, as she looked at the cross hanging under the Povarello sign in the lobby. \" In service to others.\" (Look up Povarello/Jesuit saying [\_\_\_]{.underline}.)

Oh holy crap. She stood, uncertain whether to shake hands or kneel down to an ancient and creaky looking priest. Be careful what you wish for. The whole nine yards: black, long cassock, a belt of rope, strung with a row of beads that looked like carved nutmegs. \"Brother Ziemkowski, my dear,\" said the priest---or was he a monk?\--extending a liver-speckled hand.

Lydia shook what felt like a bird claw but surprisingly, his aged grip was warm and strong. Lydia's religious knowledge was an inch thick and a thousand miles wide and she didn't know how to address a priest or a monk, so she settled for \"Hi there. I'm Lydia Rosenblum. From Inner Horizons.\"

\"You\'re here about the receptionist job?\"

\"No fa-- brother,\" she amended. \" I\'m here about the cleaning position.\"

\"On your knees\" he said. \" At least that\'s how it\'s typically done.\"

It took her a heartbeat to realize the little white haired sprite was joking with her. He had no wrinkles -- none. Yet he had to be eighty, hell, even ninety. He\'d shrunk into his bones so he looked at Lydia, who was only 5 feet in her stocking feet, with a glint in his watery bright eyes.

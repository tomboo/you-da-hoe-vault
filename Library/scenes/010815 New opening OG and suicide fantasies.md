010815 New opening OG and suicide fantasies

Key points to convey:

\--location: Couer D'Alene, Idaho

\--name of program: Inner Horizons, psychiatric treatment program for young adults

\--OG's death wish

\--peer group's regularity: twice weekly, 10-11,

Old Girl wanted to kill herself in the worst way. Well, not actually the worst way. Scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing way, though killing yourself when you only had the life experiences of Hello Kitty was almost impossible. She'd tried raiding the medicine cabinet at Aunt Peggy and Uncle David's house in Naperville, Illinois. They were health nuts and in amongst every multivitamin known to man and jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-condroitin and chia and flax and fish oil caplets, Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "keep away from children" warning. How was Old Girl supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's worst way to go?

She had a stupid, stupid phobia about blood, so guns were out, not that saintly Peggy and David had anything more in their neat, one-story ranch house besides a bumper sticker that said, "Keep Guns Out of the Hands of Our Kids." Once, at a sleepover with a girl at Naperville Middle School, her dad supposedly had a shot gun, except the girl never invited her back.

She didn't know exactly how a shot gun worked, having never seen one up close except in Die Hard re-runs but it was the blood that she couldn't wrap her head around. Being dead was the goal but she definitely didn't want to be gross.

Old Girl was very particular about dying. She spent inordinate amounts of her waking hours thinking about the perfect death which was what she was doing while Peer Group at Inner Horizons psychiatric treatment center for Young Adults droned on around her. Imagine a flock of black ravens sprawled on a circle of couches in the Healing House living room all cawing and hacking and catarrhing and never saying anything you wanted to hear and that was pretty much Peer Group for you.

Outside it was snowing once again. The snow had started falling in the Cour D'Alene valley in the middle of Idaho in October and was apparently going to keep on falling until May.

A

She didn't know if a shot gun would hurt. She didn't think so since it would be over instantaneously but what if she missed something central and she woke up with her jaw missing or paralyzed or breathing through a tube in her throat?

All the actual killing parts were neat and bloodless unlike the three messy attempts at suicide that were the reason she was stuck in Idaho at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment program for Young Adults i.e. code speak for people even more fucked up than she was.

Old Girl had been in treatment in Idaho since she was 16. Aunt Peggy and Uncle David, who were her legal guardians, brought her to Inner Horizons after her last fuck-up when she'd tried to drown herself at Camp Minnetonka summer camp in Minnesota. Picture vomiting lake water so hard the blood vessels in one eye broke so she looked like a vampire and felt like one for weeks)

(Picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions by an eager-beaver camp counselor named Scout and vomiting lake water so hard that the blood vessels in one eye burst so she looked and felt like a vampire for a month.) Dying was hard. It's why she spent so much time thinking about how to kill herself perfectly. Today, for example, while Tuesday's -jury-by-your-psycho-peers known as Peer Group went on around her. She was contemplating whether the largest icicle forming under the Healing House eaves outside the picture window would work.

A row of icicles like jagged teeth lined the eaves. Beyond them, snow fell in a continuous dim curtain of flakes that had started falling in late October and was apparently going to continue falling until May. Weak sunlight beat its way through the streams, occasionally spangling the snow-drifted lawn with diamonds. Inside, the Healing House living room was warm but close to the window where she chose to sit to be as far on the periphery of her peers as possible, Old Girl felt the cold pressing in from outside. The outside wall thermometer read 22 degrees. The last time she'd looked at it, it was 19 degrees. Yippee. Idaho's version of spring.

Ten teenagers sprawled in every attitude of boredom on an irregular circle of three couches pulled off center by a wing back chair where Darlene, the Head Therapist held court.

Strict rules governed Old Girl's fantasies. Nothing gross, for example, like the Ex-Lax fiasco when she'd experienced her own version of Banquo's death: who knew she had so much shit in her? Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed like an elephant seal out of Lake Minnetonka by an eager-beaver camp counselor named Scout, all bodily fluids were verboten. Double ditto road rash, like the kind she'd suffered along with a broken arm when she'd fallen (i.e. jumped) out of David's Buick when he went around a corner in downtown Naperville. She'd let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door but she'd learned a good lesson in both physics and calculus about objects in motion. The car had to be going thirty-five miles an hour or above or it wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations not to mention the excruciating eternity of having all that gravel hand picked out of her right hip and thigh with a pair of tweezers.

So back to the icicle. She'd watched it go from a bead of moisture over the past three weeks of Peer Group Sessions --Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 10-11 AM, rain or shine, snow or blizzard, three times a week only alleviated by individual therapy on the off days---following its progress from a small nub of ice to its current status as a three foot long dagger of ice as big around as a club. This morning, she'd heard Margaret, the Day Supervisor on duty, calling out to the front door to Rusty, the garbageman and general fix-it guy, in his rickety truck. Get off your lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they kill somebody! She'd said.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery. How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? Margaret seemed to think it was imminent based on her orders this morning. "The temperature is rising," she'd hollered out like that should mean something to him. Maybe melting was the key. She'd noticed the icicle dripping during the day, then refreezing during the night, so she assumed it was the dripping and refreezing that thickened the thing into a club in the first place. Thinking about physics and gravity and motion and mass really didn't appeal to her---it was where she always got into trouble in her attempts---which is why she turned to thinking about what she'd look like lying in a snow drift. Cinnamon-colored dreds would spread around her head like a sun storm. She'd been thinking about growing her hair out. She might look better if her long hair fanned out around her shoulders like the Little Mermaid when she was floating and singing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (song). Then again, combing her dreds out promised to be a terrible job. Old Girl wasn't the most patient person. She'd probably end up cutting them off with pinking shears or realistically, Margaret would have to be called in to wield the shears because anything sharper than a butter knife was off limits at Inner Horizons. Too fucking many cutters.

Her daydreams were more like waking stories, detailed and exacting. Usually the actual death went by quickly but the scenes that led up to the main event and the aftermath were mini-operettas. The devil was in the details. What she was wearing, how she acted secretively and smart with just the right amount of clues that foreshadowed her plans (if someone was paying attention) plus a wealth of details like the weather and settings that matched her mood---sometimes dark and creep-meister at midnight, or lit by the angled rays of a dying sunset, or occasionally like that poem she liked about Icarus falling out of the blue, unconcerned sky, with a fishing boat or a person dropping off clothes at the dry cleaners who knew nothing of the tragedy.

She spent long hours in waking day dreams planning how she would look the moment after. She was small and wiry, with the pale complexion of a red head, and particularly well endowed except in the booty. She liked to imagine death bleeching out the freckles on her forehead and cheekbones, leaving only a fetching spray of dots across a more petite nose. Her ginger-colored hair which is just about the only thing she liked about herself, often featured a primary role in these dreams. Instead of the gothic and practical dreds she'd been growing since she arrived in the Adolescents program at 16, she reverted back to straight hair which had been artfully cut and styled to fan around her face like a halo of flames. For the icicle scenario, she imagined wearing a newNorth face puff jacket in neon green or maybe an aqua color to set off her hair which would be golden red in the setting sun.

Right now, the sun wasn't visible except as a sulfurous yellow haze through the snow curtain. She'd have to wait for the weather to cooperate. If she watched the temperature during Peer Group three times a week and checked it before dinner every day, she'd get a read on the progress of melting and refreezing over time and cross-reference that with the weather report. This was why fantasizing every minute detail of her death was so much more satisfying than actually doing it. The problem with life was that there so little you could control.

Today she was crafting a whole scenario around being felled by the biggest icicle hanging from the Healing House eaves. She'd be waiting under it, her head down, supposedly searching under the bushes for a ball that had been batted against the wall from the yard. and. Giving it little nudge with a stick probably wasn't a good idea so she'd just have to stand there waiting as long as it took. God forbid she moved and the icicle stabbed her in the stomach.

None of the reality of blue dusky skin and broken blood vessels in the eyeballs or bleeding from the ears, she'd read about figured in her fantasies. She wasn't into realism. She was pretty sure whatever made you bleed from the ears wasn't attractive.

In her fantasies, Old Girl always looked calm and ethereally beautiful. Ethereal. Even the sound of it made her throat hitch. Her skin would be white and her lips blood red like Snow White after one bite of the apple.

No guns. Too afraid of the sight of blood.

Aunt Peggy and Uncle David were health nuts. Their medicine cabinet looked like the Gobi desert if the Gobi had a shit load of Sam-E and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia and flax and fish oil caplets. Hence the Ex-Lax Fiasco.

Throwing herself out of a moving car had already proved disastrous. They wouldn't let her sit by the side on the speedboat Dr. Hazey pilored around the lake in the summer. A warning must have been in her chart.

There were no medicine cabinets at Inner Horizons. Everything was dispensed from locked shelves in the Nurse's office, open only at Med Check which was manned by all of Nurse Ratchid's relatives.

Once when she was eleven, they traveled on a train to Baltimore and the rickety space between the train cars pulled at her like a magnet until Peggy forbade her to get out of her seat.

She had strict rules for acceptable ways of dying. Fear of pain kept her from fantasizing about hanging.

Hanging had been eliminated early. With her luck, she'd never be able to tie a good knot. But the main objection to almost any kind of asphyxiation was an article she'd read somewhere that the people's tongues swelled to three times their normal size and turned blue or black and hung out of their mouths like eels. Eyeballs could startout of their sockets or the whites would ooze blood. Nope. None of that.

At night, she looked forward to closing her eyes and imagining the perfect death before she let herself sleep. Often, the fantasies themselves caused her to be unable to drift off. Her mind would be too busy fabricating the bones of the story. She'd spend hours thinking about the most romantic place and what she'd be wearing. In her dreams she never wore her standard uniform at Inner Horizons. In dreams, she was always fashion forward with Jimmy Choo shoes and Vera Wang cocktail dresses, nothing Jessica McClintock sluts-ville for her. Lavender was a favorite.

The fantasies were heavy on build-up and very detailed on the aftermath but strangely fuzzy on the actual moment of dying.

She believed in building to a satisfying climax---death!---but the scene-building and tension building of her final movements were the real pleasure.

A serial quality: you started with one scene, then proceeded to create another, adding dialogue or actions or character or spectacular costume details like a red velvet dress you saw in Seventeen Magazine or Jimmy Choo shoes worn by Angelina Jolie---someone classic, never one of those trashy Kardashians or Jessica McClintock sluts-ville.

Scenes strung together like pearls that were meant to be savored and examined one by one till you came to the golden clasp which unseen hands let fall open.

The day dreams were more like living stories that you could reprogram as you thought of ways to improve them.

Sometimes, like when she'd get an A on an English paper or a teacher would tell her she was a good writer, she thought about becoming a real writer but she couldn't figure out how to be dead and a famous writer at the same time. She had enough to do concocting every detail of the perfect scene. It didn't leave enough time to write it all down.

Her deaths were always elaborately detailed---generally organized in her mind from the end going back in time to the beginning. The dying itself was always quick and painless, unlike her actual fucked-up failed attempts.

Her deaths were always elaborately plotted down to the last detail: what she was wearing, how her hair curled or straightened, who would find her and what they'd exclaim sorrowfully when they saw her loveliness in repose. Death itself was always quick and painless. It had none of the horror or shame or ugliness of reality. Even the thought of Ex-Lax made her break out in a cold sweat, remembering the acrid soapy taste of charcoal when they'd pumped her stomach. The smell---ohmygod, the smell of her own shit squirting out of her like she was hooked up to a sewer. A nurses's eyes above an aqua mask crinkling with horrible sympathy. Save me!

She applied the strict rules of realism to the manner of death. No pianos dropping out of the sky. Ditto no earthquakes opening up a giant trench in front of her. She herself had to the agent of her demise. She couldn't be passive while some magician of fate did the work. That's why the icicle dagger wasn't ideal. She'd have to pick the exact right moment to stand under it when it was likely to fall. It occurred to her that if she ran a garden hose over the ice on the eaves long enough, maybe the water would loosen it at its moorings. When gravity took over and it knocked her brains out, people would think she'd only been trying to be helpful by trying to remove the danger to others. Killed in the line of duty. That was a plot line she hadn't explored.

She was also strict about the rules of gravity and physics and organic and inorganic chemical reactions. She'd learned in real time that you ignored these at your peril. The manner of death also had to be possible without magic doors or interference by the gods she'd learned about in an online classics class on Greek tragedies. Wouldn't it be great if there was a *deux ex machina* who could blow up Peer Group with a hydrogen bomb so she could float a million miles above the Pacific ocean in a spangle of atomic particles? Hell, she'd settle for floating over Spokane. It had a nice river walk that would be lovely to survey from the air. In that scenario, of course, all the detail work would be concentrated on the before, not the explosion. All that was needed, a bright flash. A spangle of tiny particles, the tender bits of what used to make her human, held aloft by the hands of the wind.

"Angela! Come back to us!"

"Angela! You're wool gathering! Come back to the party!" The insistent edge in Darlen's nasal voice cut into her concentration. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to set the table.

"Angela? Why aren't you paying attention?"

Old Girl shook her head. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocably would not answer to the name she'd been given before her family was taken away. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off in Idaho with two big suitcases and a vague admonition to "Get well," she renamed herself Old Girl. If they could dump her in in the middle of some alternate existence, the alternate existence could bestow her with a new name and a razed identity. Reborn as blank and clean as a new slate.

She felt as old as Methuselah. Why couldn't she become Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away from her?

Darlene tapped at her clipboard with her pen like she was calling a class to attention. "Will you join us?"

"I don't know anybody named Angela. She doesn't exist."

"Excuse me. Would Old Girl please join us?" Darlene put air quotes around Old Girl, then nodded at James Olson to continue with his accountability statement. "Start from the beginning, James."

James droned on about a bag of contraband Jelly Bellies discovered in his backpack. Old Girl turned back to the group. Watching an icicle grow: the Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. On the bright side, she added the number 39 to the running tally she kept in her head of the number of feet underground that old Angela was buried. Young Angela was never going to be let out to breathe.

The whining and rationalizing and griping and blaming and trash talking that was Peer Group rushed on all around her like a river of psychobabble deep enough to drown in. Today was a Circle of Healing which made Old Girl want to take someone out just for the asinine quality of the name. Lydia Brauerman, the nympho and bulimic, read through her Letter of Accountability in a sing-song voice. She was supposed to be apologizing for sleeping with Axel Freeman, her therapist, whom everybody liked. Rumor had it he'd been fired.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers at Inner Horizons by expulsion. They were still stuck with Lydia. It wasn't clear what exactly the Letter of Accountability was accounting for. None of the kids gave a shit who Lydia fucked. It would have been like baying at the moon since she fucked everybody so no one except Paul, the Asperberger math wizard, could keep count.

Lydia read the letter in a breathy voice reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe reading a the long list of behaviors like blowing and sucking and cornholing that pretty soon had everybody laughing. "Axel pushed me away when I touched his zipper ..." Lydia was enjoying her moment in front of an audience and embellishing the details. "He said no, that wasn't appropriate touching but that's not what his woodie was saying..."

Darlene said, "We get what happened Lydia. We don't want to hear about the sex, we want to hear what you're taking ownership of."

Lydia blinked. "How can I take ownership of what I did if I don't describe it?"

"Keep going," Darlene said, pinching the bridge between her eyes and nose.

"He was moaning... but you know, in a good way..."

Darlene was a sour puss but she hadn't been born yesterday. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions today. We'll revisit your Accountability Letter in private at our next session."

Old Girl almost felt sorry for Darlene. She'd inherited Lydia in the therapist shake up. Old Girl was secretly glad she'd been allowed to keep Dr. Hazey, the program founder, as her therapist when she graduated from Adolescents to Young Adults last month when she turned 18. Hazey specialized in Adolescents, probably because he still was one, though at 47, the man was in his dotage. When did dotage start? He'd gotten his doctorate in psychiatry from Yale in 1986. She'd read that on one of his diplomas mounted on his office wall on a day when she couldn't sit down for her session. She'd tucked the worthless information in the back of her mind like a magpie with a shiny bit of tin.

After shutting Lydia up, Darlene made James Olson, the surfer dude from Malibu, California, take the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack which was obviously small potatoes considering hed crashed his birthday Porsche swhen he was stoned on weed or high on poppers, "basically out of his mind" which is what he admitted in one of those tense horrible, shame fests during Peer Group that made you want to climb in bed and never get up.

"I traded my Revos for the candy," he was saying.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons where a \$300 pair of sunglasses were worth \$5 worth of sugar high.

"Darlene asked who he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC," James said smoothly. Old Girl knew for a fact that the Reza supplied the candy because he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat with the Revos hanging off the back but it was a smart move to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College where kids in Transition were allowed to take credit. If he'd sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks with the trade. But here at Inner Horizons, all James had to do was tell Mommy and Daddy he lost his sunglasses and they'd send another pair Fed Ex and ching-ching-ching, a few more Milky Ways would show up in the stash under James Olson's mattress.

Darlene and James nattered on while a drip of moisture beaded up and rolled to the edge of the eaves. It hung there forever as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimension and it still wouldn't fall. The hang time stretched on and on until Old Girl had to blink and the droplet was gone as if it had never existed. Only a slim, silvery wetness on the side of the sharpening ice told her that it was still present, though in another form. That's how she thought of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

061216 Self Punishment Draft

All day, Lydia had kept a rigid balance sheet and by nine pm, it was time to see what it added up in her moral accounting. She went over today's score at the sink in the room she shared with Etsie while flossing and brushing her teeth.

1)  Stealing \$20 from Darlene's purse.

2)  Slapping the shit out of James for refusing to have sex.

3)  Crying like a baby in front of her mother, then telling Dr. Hazey to fuck off.

4)  Joining in on the Estie torment with psychopath Danny and sycophant Reza, both of whom made her want to puke, then poking Estie until she lost it and stabbed Reza in the back of the hand with her fork.

5)  When they hauled Estie off to Stable, she grabbed Estie's dinner brownie and crammed it down her throat, puked it up in the Margaret's office, and left it fermenting in the garbage can so Margaret would smell it in the morning.

If she had been just middling bad, like on most nights, say she had laughed at James's big feet or poked fun at Big Paul for failing to lose weight or talked about the new girl's freaky fit in her hearing\-- she would have made herself sleep without a pillow. If her behavior was worse, like she'd ratted on someone for sneaking cigarettes (Maida) or shamed someone enough to make them cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose wiped up grape juice with a favorite cashmere sweater (Danny), she would have stripped the bed and made herself lie on the bare stained mattress.

It wasn't until she heard Charlene report at dinner that storm winds were gusting and the wind chill factor was forecast at five degrees below zero that her inner judge declared a trifecta. Bare floor. Open window. Nude.

Stripped down to camisole and bikini pants, she ran through her usual skin care routine, removing her make up and lathering French eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, exfoliating the dead cells from her face with a salt scrub, closing her pores with an astringent that smelled like sulfur and vinegar from the Dead Sea, thinking about how when the cat played with the mouse too long, it was time for atonement.

She'd cracked open as far as it would go at nine PM and by nine-thirty, it had already started to crystalize on the inside of the pane with ice diamonds. Her bare legs and feet felt the cold stealing across the floor and a prickle of skin on the back of her neck rose in anticipation of full body goose bumps.

She dropped her last layer of underwear and knelt at the side of the bed like a cloister penitent about to pray on bare knees. Instead, she settled on her side where she could see the drift of slowly swirling snow flakes chasing the heat away from the room. You made your bed, now lie in it, she told herself.

It was dim and silent. A silver glow from the waning moon reflected off the snow covered fields that led to the Kootenai River and and the pulp mill next to the train tracks. Healing House settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans. She forced herself to keep her eyes open so she could watch the slow progress of the moon creep up the far wall and crawl across the ceiling with a swath of blue light. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.

A whisper of frigid breeze brought up chill bumps up on her legs and arms. Quiet, she ordered herself to stop trembling.

You did this.

You're disgusting.

You're not even here.

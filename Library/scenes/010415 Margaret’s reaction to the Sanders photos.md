010415 Margaret's reaction to the Sanders photos

Margaret thought the photos in the Healing House living room were interesting but they required a lot of dusting. Whose idea were all those heavy gold frames with all the swirls and furbelows? On the whole, though, she liked the people. They seemed like an industrious lot. Manual laborers mixed with a pastry chef with a huge bowl as big as his belly---at last, someone who enjoyed the fruits of their labors!--- a street sweeper in filthy, patched clothed. One photo showed a brick layer emerging from a hole in the ground who looked like he had just climbed out of hell. Completely done in by work.

At least someone saw them, she thought. The people weren't invisible to whoever captured them on film, not like you were invisible around the great Dr. Hazey who either had his office door closed or floated around in a haze of vacuity. She imagined the people in the photos waiting politely while the photographer fussed around with a big box. Maybe they were glad for the break in their routine. Thankful for a rest of a few minutes. Or just happy someone noticed what they were doing and thought enough of their labors to capture it.

If a photographer wandered through Healing House, she imagined showing herself cleaning toilets or unplugging the one that was forever getting clogged by whoever kept jerking off in his sock and flushing the evidence down the john. Just jerk off already and throw the crusty sock in the wash, can't you? She made a mental note to check all the boys' sock drawers and have a private word with Mr. One Sock Toilet Flusher about the limitations of modern plumbing. Margaret refined her thoughts about being preserved for posterity. She would be to ask to be shown brandishing a toilet plunger in one hand like the State of Liberty. All the socks she'd yanked from the john would be arrayed around her head like a star. That would be memorable. She'd call it *Champion of the Poor Man's Condom* which was just as good as the one in Hazey's office that was called *Three Farmers On the Way to a Dance*.

Margaret was dusting in the living room. All those ornate gold frames with the swirls and furbelows were a pain. For good measure, she spritzed at a glass a second time with vinegar and water, her grandmother's trick for keeping windows sparkly way before Windex was introduced. She scrubbed at a hickey on the face of a peasant woman entirely garbed in black before she realized it was a mole. Black skirt, black shawl, black babushka scarf typed under her chin with her hands folded over a small stomach as round as a gourd. On closer inspection, the woman's hands were chapped and cracked as if they'd been dipped in lye. It occurred to Margaret that they probably had been dipped in lye. She of all people would appreciate the vinegar solution---gentle! Doesn't take your hide off!---and not for the first time, Margaret wondered how these people on the wall were related to Dr. Hazey.

Before Alma left him with her horse whisperer (he must have been good at whispering in Alma's ear too), Margaret had overheard her reaction to Hazey's idea of hanging the old time people in a gallery. "They look like the FBIs most wanted," she said to Hazey on a day that had to exchange cars so he could take her Mercedes into the shop. Margaret didn't think the bricklayers and pastry chef and street sweepers and policeman looked criminal. Just criminally overworked. She moved on with her spritzer and balled up another newspaper to rub the streaks off a grim farmer surrounded by dour women; even the children in matching braids looked back at her with hard, unsmiling faces. If they were Hazey's relatives, he'd inherited their lack of humor but he'd somehow managed to escape their work ethic.

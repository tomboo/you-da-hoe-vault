Old Girl was trying to look nonchalant, like she was just hanging around in with nothing to do in a snow drift, when really, she waiting for the spike of ice that clung from the eaves to lose its grip on gravity and impale her.

"Just because you can't see me doesn't me I can't see you."

Margaret pushed her bull dog head through the kitchen slider, her look disgusted and partly bemused. "You'll freeze to death long before that thing falls on you."

Oh? At breakfast, Old Girl had heard Margaret scream at the trash man to get off his lazy ass and clear off the icicles that lined the windows of Healing House like a row of teeth.

"I swear, you'd try the patience of a saint! Get in here before you get frost bite. Process group is starting."

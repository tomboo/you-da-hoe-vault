09092025 James reaction to Rachel's fit

It seemed weird to be gripping the new girl's ears like a watering with two handles made of cartilage. James squeezed her skull and had never been so thankful, except when he was playing ball, that he had such a big handspan. With thumbs under her jawbones and pinkie fingers pressed on top of her skull, he held tight so no harm could come to her on his watch. OG had such a serious expression, it looked like she was on duty at the other end of Rachel's body. A vision of a painting he had seen of two people lifting Jesus's body from the cross came into his mind, though he had no idea why he would have remembered it because he'd only been in the second grade when Mom and Dad took the family to Italy.

A vision --- maybe it was a memory --- of a group of people removing Christ from the cross he saw in Italy came to mind. The dead weight of the sagging body. The strength of the man who held the weight of the dead rbody with the bent head and the sagging hips while two other people carried the body by the feet. Why a religious image would come to an unreligious James was as much of a mystery as Rachel 's ashamed expression when she opened her green eyes and focused on him with a look of fear. "It's OK," he said, wanting to make her feel safe. The whites of her eyes were visible around her pupils making her look whale-eyed with distress, like their anxious and high-strung rescue dog. "I've got you." He gentled his hands while holding her head's weight so she felt supported in his arms.

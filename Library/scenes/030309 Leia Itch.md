030309 Leia Itch

Peer Interaction

It was like an itch. A terrible itch. And the more you scratched, the worse it itched. Leia was hoping the newbie would be a boy --a hella-boy with a hella-itch itch to match. James was already showing signs of wimping out. She couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Leia's experience, which was broad, boys were hella- horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, its implacability (a word on her G.E. D. vocabulary list) they dropped off like flies. She had been seriously bummed when the long haired blond girl stumbled into breakfast asking for coffee. The expression on her face when they said she could have herbal tea!

When the new girl started flopping on the carpet*, Maybe they should have given her coffee* flashed through her mind.

Darlene, Process Group leader that day, shot into action like a rocket. Leia got the wooden spoon as ordered --*what, are they going to beat her with it?* -and then, because she didn't know what else to do, sat down in Darlene's chair while the seizure continued. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so freakish Leia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's bag with her wallet clearly visible at the top. Everybody else was tuned into the freak show. She picked out a twenty dollar bill in one smooth motion and it was safe in her pocket before the jerking and shuddering came to a stuttering halt.

Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling the blond up to go to the hospital. Leia nudged James from behind, then slipped into the bathroom.

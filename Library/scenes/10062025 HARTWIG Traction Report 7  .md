Cynthia Hartwig

Deadline 7, October 6, 2025

NEW + GOOD REPORT

•. The last 5 weeks have been spent seriously working through the novel's plotting issues and writing a long form synopsis that is helping me see the story as a whole and play with its order.

•. The plotting work is helping me mine the chronology and move scenes backwards or forward in time, depending on how much and when I want to reveal emotional parts of characters' backstories. It feels like I am solving a lot of my "pipe laying" errors this way; I can feel the story building in intensity. Laughing at my own jokes!

•. I have also spent generative writing time working on the novel's opening. I haven't put these writes into a rough draft yet. But the file I have built tells me I've essentially got most of its pieces.

•. A fun craft thing I started doing are the Stunning Sentences writes with Nina Schuyler on Substack. I learned to do sentence imitations 25 years ago with Priscilla Long (highly recommend her book, The Writer's Mentor.) One of Nina's exercises gave me the idea for my opening sentence.

•. My novel engagement remains high (read: obsession). Progress comes with steady work habits.

TRICKY BITS

It perennially surprises me how long this close work takes. I go down many rabbit holes and have to back out often, though the story problems eventually get solved. I wonder if it's going to take me a full year to edit this novel as tightly as I can? I find I don't need the tiny whip quite as much because of my full-immersion daily novel bath but my plan is to not rock the boat.

FOCUS AND NEXT STEPS FOR THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE

For the next deadline, it makes sense for me to keep working the overall scene plotting. I didn't quite reach my goal to figure out a locked order and write a synopsis of every scene, though I am close. Thinking through scene causality/consequences did help me discard scenes that aren't needed but it has also generated new ones.

I still want to have you read through my long-form synopsis and Zoom with you to discuss. Seems like I need another 2 weeks of plotting work before we do that. I'll look at your schedule and find a time that works before 10/20. I keep wondering when you're getting the appendix out!

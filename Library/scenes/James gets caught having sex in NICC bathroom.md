THE TRAIL TO TWO MOUTH LAKE CLIMBED gently for a mile. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of this hellhole, he wanted to be in shape to play basketball at Cal State. Would the move back home to California be like going from one circle of hell to the next? He'd been working his way through *The Inferno* from the rag-tag library at Healing House, not that he'd ever let about his voracious reading to his parents. They'd long since given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but World of Warcraft.

As they zigzagged up the hillside, James caught views of the blue upper peaks. Grayish-white in the near-distance, white-blue in the distance, until a vastness stretched diamond white and merged with the sky. A stutter flight of a bird was shocked out of a bush by their noise. It winged away in flight with tight claps of its feathers to its body in a syncopated stroke-stroke-stroke and gliiiiiide.

The group griping quieted down once the trail steepened.

James was glad Lydia got left behind at Healing House. She was still in a wicked snit about how James had wrestled her hand away from his crotch in the van, which was how Bruce caught them. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight! The fucktard. Was he a piece of meat? He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Lydia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the women's bathroom at NICC where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (Progress! Dr. Mom enthused on their weekly Family Call.)

He wished he was taking Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Lydia was motivated by the danger rather than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for love, he told himself. It would be nice just to be liked.

The new girl, Rachel, tramped steadily behind him. She was keeping up with him and they were way ahead of the pack so he assumed she was in pretty good shape. He'd heard she was into ballet. Old Girl, who was dogging their heels, was also in shape but she didn't count because she spent hours on the treadmill every day. James always had to hand over his allowance so she'd let him have an extra forty-five minute run. Five bucks for a weekly allowance! What kind of trouble could you get in with that? James remembered the day he turned eight and Dad handed him \$50 for his first allowance. The look on Mom's face when she found all the licorice he hid under his bed.

Giant snow-heavy Ponderosa pines pinched off light on the trail. It felt claustrophobic. A whumph of snow dropped from a branch in a blinding plume that made him jump.

James was always cold in Idaho. When you grew up in Malibu, shorts and flip-flops were all you wore to armor yourself against the day. Idaho required a full body suit of flannel and wool and two-inches of down. Sometimes it felt so thick, it felt like he was choking. Today, though, he was sweating. He threw off layers of down and wool and polyester that smelled rank and disgusting. He'd expected a sense of freedom or at least largeness when Mom and Dad told him they were sending him to the Idaho wilderness "to grow up." Instead, he felt small and inconsequential, a mere speck, in thousands of miles of trees and mountains and ice that stretched to forever.

"Slow down!" somebody in the back yelled. Rachel stepped on the back of James' snowshoe and he almost fell over. "Sorry!" she said. James knelt to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the straps. "It's okay, I was dreaming."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she was worried about breaking Inner Horizon's endless rules. They'd gotten the mandatory stay-together lecture at the trailhead. James had heard it fifty times, even at the bowling alley.

Old Girl stepped out of the trail and skirted around them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "Don't sweat it," he said to Rachel, "It's OK as long as the three of us hang together."

He tramped steadily upward, glad to work on his endurance. The stillness was disconcerting. No foot tracks. A soft skitter of some four-footed creature's footpads. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone who lived at the end of their street. What he'd really like to see is a wolf though he'd settle for an elk. Something majestic. If he saw an elk, he'd have something he could talk about on the weekly Family Torture call.

James parents were always asking him why he never thought about the consequences. Generally, he thought, "Hey, this'll be rad!" Or "Whooee!" Lately, when he woke up gasping with his heart going 180 beats a minute, he wondered if the fun had ever been worth it.

If that was the life lesson he was fated to repeat, how could he bear it?

His parents should just give it up and accept that James was a fuck-up and a loser. Not everybody could be like his sister with her astronomical SAT scores. James had endured a week of agonizing dinnertime angst hoping that his scores had gotten lost on the way to Siberia.

He checked the mail faithfully back then but once he started coming home drunk and stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks?

A shit load, it turned out.

JAMES HAD THE BAD LUCK TO run into Rachel in the girl's bathroom at Northern Idaho Community College. He was coming out of the disabled person's stall after waiting a minute or two for the coast to clear after Lydia strolled out. She had reapplied her lipstick.

James had figured out that blow jobs were rough on lipstick. He had pink stains on his underwear to prove it. James took his time doing some stretches. Standing sex put a strain on his lower back. It wasn't that Lydia was heavy, in fact, she was more like an oversexed doll than a taller than normal 18- year-old.

Rachel met his eyes as he came out of the stall. She was leaning against the sink with a frown.

"Why do you let her abuse you?" Rachel said.

"Abuse me? We have sex."

"Leia doesn't give a shit about you. Aren't you worth more than a quickie? "

I'm worth less than a quickie, James thought.

"Do you mind?" Rachel waved toward a stall. \"I\'m here for a reason.\"

Well, me too, James wanted to say. But the door swung open and shit-on-a-stick, James's Intro to Humanities teacher, Mrs. Lengel, walked in.

Professor Lengel looked enquiringly at him. James flashed her his trademark crumpled smile, like maybe she'd think he got mixed up between the Men\'s and the Women\'s and he beat it the hell out of there.

He didn't think Rachel would rat him out back at Inner Horizons, but you never knew. People made up stories about each other in Process Group all the time to relieve the boredom. All he knew about Rachel was that she was a cutter. She seemed a lot more interested in hurting herself than someone as lame as James. There was always hope.

022019 James Changes Position with Reza

James looked wildly around, feeling like he was grasping for a life line. "Where's that Shiva H. Vishnu sweatshirt? The one you always wear? You love Apu!"

Reza, at the doorway, stern as a bantam cock with his slicing beak of a nose, sniffed. "A friend gave me that. A brown friend! Don't you know what irony is? Or as you as clueless about irony as you are about racism?"

James was shocked to hear himself called a racist. Why, half his friends on the basketball team were black!

"Monkey Boy isn't racist? Simba isn't racist? Apu is the wrong fucking religion and from the wrong country and he's a stereotype. Jesus, you call me every name in the book except the right one and I'm the clueless one!"

From his position, sitting on the sagging corner of Reza's bed, James saw the room for the first time from Reza's point-of-view. At the all-white people in James's pictures. At the poster of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ white basketball player going for a jump ball. AT the blow-up James's mom had sent of James on waterskis sending up a big roostertail of white. There was a signed poster of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his muscle-building days at Venice Beach that James had asked Arnold to sign at some 4^th^ of July party on the Stallone's beach house in Malibu. It looked like a privileged life from this point-of -view. And a white one. There was not a brown or even an Asian face among them. Well, except for Sammy, their Hispanic gardener, who was off to the side of the picture cleaning the pool.

James was used to looking at Reza's side of the room. At an unmade bed with too many blankets because Reza was always cold. At a black tousled head of hair that stuck up at odd angles in his sleep. He rarely saw the warm brown color of Reza's skin because Reza slept with his head under the covers. He complained ceaselessly about not having temperature controls in their room so he couldn't turn the heat up. James pissed him off regularly by opening the window next to his bed to let in some air.

Reza and three sisters, all almost identical in height and color except for their distant ages. Reza was the baby. The long sought after boy. Everyone in the family was a lot older. A picture of Mr. Chata\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, receiving some academic award from an old guy in a cap and gown. A woman in a sari that James presumed was James' mother.

But it wasn't Reza's part of the room that interested him. He looked at it all the time. It was the new view from Reza's bed into James' space. At the picture of James at sixteen with his new birthday corvette. At the blow-up poster of James waterskiing behind Dad's new boat that Mom had sent to him to cheer him up. James was sending up a white rooster tail of spray and madly grinning. The picture of Mom and Dad and Susan and James in front of the beach house, right after it was finished. Blue water that stretched out beyond the family unit. If James remembered right, one of the Mexican workers had been conscripted to take the picture so everybody -- meaning every white person in the household -- could be in the frame.

It was weird. Unsettling to see the white and brown bifurcation between the two sides of the room that he and Reza shared. Never the twain shall meet, an odd phrase Mom liked to use, rose in his thoughts. Was he guilty as Reza had said, of casual clueless racism? Or just cluelessness in general? Or both?

One part of his brain---the regressive, lizard-ish primitive part---said, "Naaah. Half my friends are black." The other half, the one that was growing and maturing and opening up to a new and uncomfortable view of himself, whispered, "Yes."

022119 Blocking thoughts

James had come over to Reza's bed and rewrapped the gauze, thinking he'd held him out as a way of leading up to the apology. Remembering Josh's advice to "get close to him," he sat on the corner of the bed, forcing Reza to move closer to the wall. It wasn't long before James had the sense that Reza had backed himself into the corner to get away from him.

In one moment they were talking like equal human beings. In the next, Reza was eeling off the bed like a brown Houdini, and the tables were turned. Reza swept to the door in his homeboy pants and his #MeToo sweatshirt which he loved to wear.

"Why not #BlackLivesMatter?" James had asked cluelessly when he started wearing it.

Reza shrugged. "Women, boys, queers, black people, brown people, Rohingas. We're all oppressed."

Then, James had laughed but now, #Metoo took on a different meaning. He would never hurt a woman, would he. But then, a slithering, sibilant whisper came to him: but you have. He'd never hurt his black friends, Turk and Dragon and Ham. But he had by putting them in a little box marked "different."

It was as if there was a birfucation or a divide as large as a chasm in the room. James side was all white: white family photos, white rooster-tale of spray thrown up by James's dad's white boat, white authors on the book shelves, white towls, even a white-ish bedspread now graying with wear that had been picked out by some white designed hired by his mother to look clean.

Reza's side of the room was colorful with soccer photos of a brown scrum of guys in red, brown and yellow uniforms; there was Reza's extended brown family around Reza in a dark mortar board scowling; Ella Fitzgerald in a brown coppery dress that set off her skin like firelight. James looked down at the bedspread he was sitting on. It was a warm saffron color with raised brown nubs that Reza, in his constant movement, had worn into bare balding patches of lighter brown.

From James' perspective, it looked like his own side of the room was barren and bare, devoid of much of anything except privilege. Reza's bed was small, especially in comparison to James's extra long matter and frame for his 6'5" height. He somehow felt cramped in Reza's space, less comfortable, like James was the one who was occupying the part of the room with more air.

He started to apologize again and then names James had called him rolled out of Reza like a Biblical reading of Leviticus and Elijah and the begats.

James sat down on the corner of the mattress, saying, "Scoot over. There's not enough room."

"There is for me," Reza said. "When you're not hogging the mattress."

"Do you want some help or not."

"I guess."

The bed was small. James had an extra-long mattress to accommodate his 6'4" frame. In comparison, Reza's bed was child-sized. Reza weighted about 120 pounds. James was sixty or seventy pounds heavier; he wasn't fat, just tall and big framed and muscular. Everything Reza was not.

James had a lot of stuff crammed into his side of the room. It had all been packed up by Lupe, their ever-obliging maid, and sent to Idaho to make him more comfortable. His stuff---the lacrosse stick, basketballs, a tennis racket, new snow shoes of carbon fiber, half a dozen ascending weighted dumbbells, and an inflated ball for stretching and stacks of books had spilled over into Reza's space.

James was a lot taller: they'd had to move Reza's stuff further in the corner of the room to accommodate the extra-long mattress and bedstead, plus a large desk chair to fit his frame. James had begged his mother to have Lupe sent him the inflated exercise ball so he had something to stretch his back. By comparison, Reza's space was constricted.

James had unwittingly shoved him into the corner and hadn't even noticed the incursion. Why would he? He was always looking down at Reza from a superior height, a raised bed, a larger chair, a bigger desk. James remembered complaining bitterly about having no space when he'd arrived. Reza had already been in the room and obligingly, a small smile lighting up his brown face, he'd moved into a smaller footprint to accommodate James' demands. Now it felt like James was occupying three-quarters of the space while Reza got squeezed into the corner.

James got the idea that he'd somehow pushed Reza to the point of no return. But how?

James was conscious of the moment Reza lost it. But not what caused the explosion. He shouted, "I fucking hate Apu!"

He eeled suddenly out of the corner, squirming past James off the bed so that James had to turn around in surprise to look at him. Reza was standing in the doorway with bared teeth. A look of rage so hot played on his face that James was shocked. His teeth, white in his brown face, looked sharp. James had a momentary thought that Reza wanted to bite him.

111613 Hazey plans a vacation

Dr. Haley rifled a finger over the unorganized shelves of CDs that filled two bookcases across from his desk. He was looking for Boris Godunof but then he decided the Russian revolution and the warring peasants weren't all the relaxing for reviewing cruise brochures. Did proletariats get vacation?

He had to pick a vacation to look forward to or all the crap he had to do would make him certifiable. What he really wanted to do was lock his office door, settle back with his Bose head phones that shut out the distant sound of kids squabbling in the game room next door, and spend the rest of the day choosing between the islands of Tahiti or the archipelago of Fiji.

Hi slid Don Ho into the CD player, Tiny Bubbles, The Remastered Classic. Unlocked the bottom drawer of his desk where the palm trees and airbrushed blue waves of a tropical paradise called him away from the view of the icicle-fringed birdbath on his lawn.

Shit. Fucking Calliope, the relentless new bookkeeper had piled a stack of billing on his chair. The yellow post-it note said, "Sign [today]{.underline}." Fuck. Fuck Fuck. Hazey felt persecuted and put upon by his new hire. The Inner Journey's secret was that it was an Outer Journey for almost everybody he hired with an average turn over rate of 60% according to the uber-organized and military martinet with the unlike name of Calliope Calisto. Even the woman's handwriting was commanding: the Post It note was magic markered and ended in an exclamation mark that looked like a raised finger. A middle finger to Hazey's authority as head of Inner Journeys World Enterprises, with plans for offices in Spokane and Boise and Billings as his 10-step process for taking troubled teens to untroubled maturity took root.

Parents with sick kids were willing to pay through the nose for th hope of mental help, hope being the operative word, not so much the delivered product, if Hazey was willing to admit the truth which he typically didn't. Especially not now when the pleasure of planning a getaway from his empire warred against the need to run the damn thing.

He settled the fat soft earphones over his head and ukulele chords strummed the palm trees of Fiji and Mauritius and Kona---anywhere far from frozen Idah---into his ears. He opened a bottle of Quaaludd's he'd stashed in his pocket, ignoring the prescription label made out for Rebekkah Rabinowitz, the Jewish girl with runaway anxiety that had made her run off and be treated at Harvard's Medill Center when her parents figured out that Hazey's 10-step process was 9 steps short of helping Rebekkah cope.

He washed down two 'luuds with a swig of Courvoisier stashed under the vacation brochures and leaned back in the leather chair and flipped through pages of happy silver-haired couples, thin and carefully coifed and proof that money was the only weapon against age.

He didn't hear the door open. Don Ho was warbling about the warm trade winds but he felt a cold ripple of frigid air from the hall as it lifted an invoice off the stack he'd dumped on his desk and floated onto his lap. He'd been admiring a glossy photo of a cabana with a view of the ocean. An invoice stamped "past due" sailed over the page and settled over it like an omen.

When he rocked his chair around, the headphones blasted calming ukulele and harp strings and Hazey could feel the happy slowing of his bloodstream from the double Quaaluud booster treat. He flashed a beatific smile. Dr. Eustace Aloyisius Hazey, Ph.D and Found of the Inner Journeys Institute headquartered in Coeur D'Alaine Idaho, reporting to staff inspiration duty.

Two of his staff members --Calliope and Michael O'Brien, the head therapist\-- were circling each other like a pair of street fighters.

Don Ho evaporated like steam in the face of the Calliope's glare. "How are we going to pay your salary?" she was asking when Hazey proper the ear phone on his temples. "Those deadbeats haven't made a payment since August!"

"Etsy's sick!" Michael's big fleshy face was alarmingly red. Not that Hazey was alarmed, but his medical training registered the flush, the rapid pulse in his carotid artery, the gasp in his voice. Too many burgers and milkshakes were building up in Michael's mid-forties arteries; they were also showing in a belly as big as a pregnant woman's, except lower and drooping over his belt.

"You put her in Stabilization for three weeks. Do you know how expensive 24-hour medical supervisions is? The parents can't pay. Send her home!"

"Over my dead body! Etsy is staying. What the fuck do you know about therapy? You're a book-keeper!"

"I can add," she said sternly. "That's more than you can do."

Hazey heard Don Ho singing in a tinny voice through the earphones that were playing to his frontal lobes. *Here's a toast to the silver sea. And mostly here's a toast to you and me.* Michael and Calliope were both staring at him as if they expected him to say something. What? What could they possibly want when *Tiny bubbles in the wine make me happy, make me happy, make me feel fine?*

"Dr. Hazey, you've got to tell her. We can't release Etsy. She's a powder keg."

Wasn't Etsy that lumbering fat girl with the pimples? Hazey's recollection of Etsy was that she was the one who sat in a great lump answering in monosyllables. He remembered the staff talking about her in weekly staff meeting. She'd go for weeks without speaking a word and then some little thing---not getting the salt passed to her in a timely manner, a sharp word\-\--would set off an explosion of violence. Fork in the back of somebody's hand? Wasn't that what sent her to Stable the last time? Hazey had a dim memory of having to explain the incident to the parents of the kid who's been stabbed. The trick was to minimize the incident to the parents and maximize it on the insurance claim. Who was it who got forked? He'd have to see if he was stilling writing prescriptions in their name. Maybe that would help him remember.

"How late are they?" Hazey had a dim recollection of two hefty, blubbering parents on the couch that Michael and Calliope were now occupying at opposite ends, like two prize fighters waiting in their corners for the bell.

"They haven't made a full payment---" Calliope riffled through her notes with lips pursed in the tiny wrinkle lines of a drawstring purse. What a good person to have collecting fees, floated through Hazey's bubbles. A purse that only took money in and never let it out. He was flooded with a sense of love and well being. If he had any sexual feelings, which he had long ago forgotten due to the cocktail ofuppers, downers and status quo drugs he used, he would marry her. Perhaps Michael should marry her as Hazey's proxy? He could bring up the idea at Michael's next review.

"Dr. Hazey? The two ofthem were looking at him with hungry eyes.

Michael's voice seemed to be coming from far above the thin voice of Don Ho reverberating on his temple like a small buzzing fly. His nose was pressed to the glass plate that protected the rosewood surface of the desk. It felt cool on his forehead. "*Here's to the golden moon. Here's to the silver sea. Here's to me and me."*

"Umm. Are you feeling OK, Doc?"

Warm, tropical darkness.

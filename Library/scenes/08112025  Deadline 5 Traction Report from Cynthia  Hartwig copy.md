Deadline 5, August 11, 2025

Dear Kerry,

NEW + GOOD REPORT

Editing is teaching me to edit better, faster, (maybe) more efficiently. I've really got momentum behind me. It's really exciting and satisfying to see the puzzle pieces come together as I work my novel's themes and leitmotifs.

You really, really helped me with our conversation about editing. I realized I had to find a different way to edit and so I tore up my process and reorganized my thinking. Working by character and building their arcs of change works for me.

Once I went back and dredged up all of the scene writes I've done, I am heartened to see how much good writing and revelation is in my raw material. Working from the emotional writes gives me power that comes through the ravages of the close edit.

Best of all, I see my progress and am really, really confident in the power of my story. This traction proves to me that I will finish.

Writing about the trouble spots or scene issues in my early hours when I wake up allows me to use my "generative writing gene" productively. Sometimes it takes me a few days to grope around in my notebook to find the fix. In this way, the Default Mode Network of my brain works on the issue behind the scenes and somehow shows me what to do.

I put a scene in Dropbox that is called OG Lights Out for the Territories. It's the last scene in the novel. It felt like a huge hill to climb but I think it has the interiority and earned growth I want. You might read it to see if you agree :-)

TRICKY BIT

This phase of editing is slow. It takes intense concentration and a lot of decisions. I have been in a psoriatic arthritis flare for months (long !\$%\$\$ story) so I am exhausted by the end of my 3-4 hours of work. I envisioned this stage as the time when I would do more sentence crafting and language work, but now I see that it's still too early. I think I have to just accept that it's a slow process and enjoy each stage instead of thinking I can magically will it to go quicker.

ACCOUNTABILITY SINCE I STARTED

•. My plan for completing the character arcs of my main characters continues apace. I'm still crafting the scenes of my main character, OG. While slower than I expected, who cares?

•. I have a good system set up: daily working hours that are so habitual, I don't even think about doing something else; a well organized system of all my scene writes per character in a dedicated file box; a good, positive attitude that all this work is coming together beautifully.

FOCUS FOR THE NEXT DEADLINE

My focus hasn't changed. I will continue to complete all OG scene drafts; I will then move on to Lydia's scenes and do the same thing. They comprise the largest arcs-of-change.

NEXT STEPS + ACTIONS

I find it fascinating that the structure of having a book coach with deadlines every two weeks has been plenty to keep me accountable. You're kind of a talisman in the sky for me; I know you're there if I need you and I'm happy to see that I do indeed know what to do and am doing it :-)

Our mini-contract of 2 months ran out. I plan to keep paying your monthly fee until I complete the edit. Why jinx something that's working so well? Maybe I can win a prize for the easiest client you have!

I have been watching what you're up to on Instagram with your Storytending Shorts. They are great: simple but valuable. I'm happy to do one with you as a testimonial to the whip. In fact, I think I'll book a half-hour Zoom for the purpose of talking through my marketing video idea for BookTok and we can talk about your marketing.

HAZEY CALLED MARGARET INTO HIS office and Gretchen, the nutritionist, shot her a Grinchy smile. Shit in a shoe! Margaret\'s heart quailed. Had the witch ratted her out for saying the oatmeal sucked?

Margaret needed her crappy, low paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional psychiatric treatment facility West of the Mississippi." That's what Darlene, who'd been trying to land another job for months, had told a colleague that morning on the phone.

Margaret couldn't afford to leave, no matter how crappy the pay. Her husband, Hank, ruptured a disk moving a 300-pound patient at his job as a nurse at Benewah Health almost a year ago. They'd been living on one income ever since. The taxes on their 10-acre farm were due next month. She had no idea how she was going to pay them.

Hazey sat king-like behind his gleaming walnut desk. Not a paper on it. Only a folder and an expensive fountain pen the shape of a silver bullet.

\"Gretchen said you contravened her authority and questioned her personal worth in front of the residents.\" Hazey loved big words with chewy syllables. In fact, what Margaret had said to Gretchen Beener, possibly the only trained dietician in the world who couldn't follow a recipe for oatmeal, was, \"Are you trying to poison them? This shit tastes like charcoal."

\"The oatmeal was burned,\" Margaret said carefully. \"The kids were complaining that it tasted foul.\"

\"They\'re always complaining,\" he said. \"They\'re kids.\"

Well, Hazey had that right. Even though all the kids in the program had psychiatric issues, they were still, at heart, kids. Quick to laugh at Margaret's dumb jokes. Quick to whine and complain. Quick to point out the disappointing behavior of adults. Just like her own kids in their teenage years, just more fucked up.

\"I\'m a really good cook,\" Margaret said. "I could take over breakfast. Gretchen's always complaining she doesn\'t have enough time for meal planning.\" Really, she was always complaining that she needed a cigarette, which perhaps accounted for the fact that every taste bud on her tongue was dead.

Hazey frowned down at a glossy color brochure with a picture of a tropical blue ocean and palm trees for so long Margaret wondered if he\'d forgotten how to read.

She waited a decent amount of time. When he didn't respond, she asked, "Is everything OK?\"

\"I need a vacation. The stress is killing me.\"

Doctor Hazey didn\'t look stressed. He was reclined in a leather chair with his feet on the desk. At 49, the same age as Margaret, he looked like he took care of himself a lot better than she did. A tall tweedy man with gelled salt-and-pepper hair, he wore his usual professorial sport jacket with suede elbow patches and dress slacks. The paisleys in his tie looked like red eyeballs.

Margaret couldn't take her eyes off the shoes that were thrust in her field of vision. One was a black wingtip with a shiny, flesh-colored sole. The other shoe was brown. A wingtip, but scuffed on a worn black sole.

"Dr. Hazey, do you know your shoes don\'t match?\"

He slid the palm trees over a fraction of an inch and peered at his feet. They looked like two narrow barges on the lake of the desk. The news seemed to take a long time to reach his brain. \"I can\'t meet Lydia Bronfmann's mother in these.\"

Lydia's mom was making a fly-by? The only family that Margaret knew about was Lydia's paternal grandparents, the ones who made a fortune in liquor in Michigan. Margaret racked her brain and couldn't recall Lydia receiving any phone calls or letters.

"I thought her grandparents had custody?"

Hazey shook his head. Not a hair moved. "Her mother has custody but she has to see Lydia once a quarter or she loses it."

In Sandpoint, Idaho, where Margaret grew up, custody was when they took you in the back of a police car to the Cottonwood penitentiary.

"Lydia said she wouldn't talk to her." Hazey sighed. He flipped to a page of elderly sunbathers without wrinkles near a cerulean sea.

"Look on the bright side. She probably won't notice your shoes," Margaret said.

Whatever Hazey meant to tell her when he called her into his office got co-opted by the shoe crisis. Ten minutes later, Margaret found herself behind the wheel of Hazey's Lexus SUV. She was amazed to drive a car with heated leather seats. Only 1900 miles on the odometer.

It was easy to find Hazey's enormous glass and concrete house on the west shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene. It was the only aggressively contemporary place in a neighborhood of log houses that were built to look like cabins but were five times larger than the one Margaret had grown up in.

Hazey's driveway was clear of snow. Dry as a desert. Shit and Canola! He had a *heated* driveway?

Margaret's lower back winged at the sight of river-blue and rust-streaked slate, the only spot of color in a uniformly white neighborhood. She'd spent an hour that morning shoveling her ten-year-old Suburban out of the rutted country lane she and Hank lived on. Hank couldn't lift a bag of dog food since the accident.

Normally the fact that Hazey made more money than she and Hank would ever see in a lifetime didn't bother her. But was a 5% raise too much to ask?

Hazey was known to call Inner Horizons an albatross around his neck or when he was in a bad mood, a vampire that sucked his blood.

If Inner Horizon's was a vampire, quite a bit of blood had been sucked into building the glassed-in, two-story entry. Gleaming black wood floors. A red and black art rug with a zigzag pattern that was repeated in exactly the reverse order in the living room. Margaret's dream of having an electric garage door opener embarrassed her for its poverty of the imagination.

By the time she worked her way back to the master bedroom, passing not one but *two* white sofas that would have stayed clean in Margaret's house for less than five minutes, she was convinced Hazey truly was insane.

Some forty pairs of shoes were arranged in mahogany cubbyholes. Anybody could make the Hazey's mistake with so many pairs of shoes, she thought, except that the chandelier in the closet was big enough to light up Chicago. Who would put a chandelier with a million crystals where no one could see it? Margaret wondered for perhaps the thousandth time, had getting a Ph.D. replaced Dr. Hazey's common sense?

She was about to leave by the side door in the kitchen when she heard the clanging of garbage bins. Out front, she spotted Rusty Harrow, who picked up trash for all the Inner Horizon's facilities. Unincorporated Kootenai County was too backward to have its own garbage service.

Rusty was pawing deep in a garbage bin, occasionally holding up junk to his inspection. Probably collecting anything salvageable to sell at the dump he'd inherited from his old man. Margaret shrank back from the kitchen window so she wouldn't be seen.

There was something off about Rusty Harrow. Actually, there was something off about all the Harrows, starting with the old man, Stan Harrow, who started the dump back in the fifties. It was hidden on the other side of the butte from Healing House about a mile and a half as the crow flew, but five miles away by dirt road.

Stan Harrow beat the crap out of those kids. Three of the Harrow boys were older than Margaret and Rusty was in her grade through elementary school to whatever year he dropped out of high school. She still remembered him coming to school with occasional bruises and black eyes. Once when she sat behind him in the 8^th^ grade, a trail of dried blood ran out of his ear.

These days, you'd call CPS. Back then, everybody turned a blind eye. What people did at home was their business.

No wonder all of Rusty's brothers and the one sister---Olga? Helga? --got the hell out as soon as they could. All except Rusty who'd inexplicably stayed on. When Stan died in a mysterious trailer fire, Rusty took over the dump and made a living picking up from anybody willing to pay him under the table.

Now and then, she'd see him one of the six other facilities that comprised Hazey's psychiatric empire. He was still driving his old man's ancient stake-bed truck. Amazing the old junker still ran. She hadn't talked to him in years, other than to yell at him for leaving the bins overturned in the driveway. He looked like time had been hard on him. He'd always been built like a fireplug, but now his black, greasy hair was receding and he'd gone to flab in the gut. His shoulders were powerful and muscled from a lifetime of hefting trash barrels. Margaret still remembered the musty, feral smell that trailed him in the halls of high school and wondered if he was still allergic to bathing.

The smell of smoke wafted by Margaret's nose from the cat door. Damn. Now Rusty was taking a smoke break.

Margaret supposed Hazey had contracted with him to pick up trash here. Haley probably buried his personal fees in with the business bills. Just one more way bosses made money and people like Margaret didn't.

She wandered past a glossy black dining table with red leather chairs. A sad grouping of water-starved poinsettias ran down the center. Maybe it used to look festive but now, a month after Christmas, pale spindly arms reached weakly for the sun. Withered leaves dirtied the black veneer.

Where was Hazey's housekeeper? Margaret had counted nine Grape-nuts-encrusted cereal bowls in the sink. When she looked in the fridge, there was a single carton of 1% milk and four bottles of Röderer champagne. Margaret's Costco-stocked cupboards and jars of home canned fruit and a freezer half full of Sausage, the pig Hank had raised and butchered last fall, made her life look pretty full. Did the man eat out every meal except breakfast?

What a life.

By the time she wandered back to the master bathroom, she had to take a pee. She resolutely refused to look in the black low-slung toilet. Some things you just didn't want to know about your employer.

Clearly, the man didn't know how to pick up after himself. His bed was unmade. Dirty tee shirts and balled up underwear and a pair of pajama bottoms dotted the carpet. A certain dishevelment had cropped up in Hazey's dress after Alma's departure. She preferred thinking about her boss as an overspending, luxury-flaunting chucklehead than a lonely, slightly down-at-the-heels man unraveling at the seams like his pajamas. She opened the medicine cabinet to look for an Excedrin and did a double take.

Holy shit!

Hazey\'s cabinet wasn\'t just a medicine cabinet; it was the whole drug cornucopia that Inner Horizons kept stocked for its residents. Magically reconstituted in the director's bathroom! Her first thought was that Hazey must have been dying. HIV/AIDS? But Hazey seemed completely asexual. Uninterested in either sex. So that didn't fit.

She read labels for a prescription for Klonopin. Another for Atavan. Diazepam. Valium. Delaudid. Tirazepam. A bottle of Clonazepam prescribed to April Cohen whom Margaret remembered as a New Yorker with the investment banker dad who had moved his daughter to McLain when Harvard opened their new anorexia wing.

She reached for a bottle of Adderall; this one belonged to Reza Silverstein. Reza was the motor mouth ADHD kid from Camden, New Jersey, who couldn't sit still for love nor money. Hazey had gained weight after Alma's departure but a week or two ago, he'd been bragging about how he'd lost twenty pounds "just like that!" He punctuated how easy it was with a snap of his fingers. Just say no, he'd said. Was her boss saying No to food while he said Yes to Reza Silverstein's Adderall?

When Angela Livengood's name showed up on a bottle of Lorazepam, Margaret's maternal hackles went up.

Old Girl had a hell of a time sleeping. The kid was famous with the Night Supervisors as a card shark. It was common knowledge among the night staff if you needed help staying awake on your shift, all you had to do was walk by Old Girl's room with a heavy tread. She'd come right out with a deck of cards.

Margaret liked Old Girl. She was wicked funny. Never complained. Personally, she would have preferred that Old Girl would bitch and moan or even howl at the moon if it helped relieve her depression.

That morning, Old Girl had asked Margaret about the danger from falling icicles. "You're not thinking of standing under one are you?" Margaret had asked.

"What---you think I've got a hole in my head?"

"No, but I think you might want one."

"You never let me get away with anything!"

"Who would I have to bug if you weren't around?"

Old Girl had flipped one floppy deadlock away off her forehead and sighed. "Of all nut houses in the world, I get the one with Mother Fucking Teresa."

By the time Margaret read all the labels on the shelves, she counted up 89 prescriptions of a psychotropic nature, the majority for kids who had left the program.

About half way through her inventory, she registered the rumble of Rusty Harrow's truck leaving the driveway. Margaret\'s brain was busy solving the conundrum of the enormous drug stash in Dr. Hazey\'s home bathroom and she no longer had time to think about how crazy Rusty Harrow was.

Dr. Hazey was writing new prescriptions for whatever drugs he wanted in the names of kids he\'d treated and those records were available in Hazey\'s office. Margaret cleaned his office every week and she knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the top right drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and anybody else who wanted to know whatever he didn't want them to know but was too lazy to hide.

She wished she hadn't taken all the bottles off the crammed shelves. Damn. What if Hazey organized his drugs in a certain order? She randomly tucked them in wherever she found space. Nothing she could do about it if Hazey figured out that she\'d spent an interesting half hour perusing his personal Pleasure Chest.

She was so shaken by the discovery of Hazey's drug stash, she forgot the damn shoe she'd been sent for. She remembered it on the way out of his gated community. The one with the sign that said Kootenai Reserve. Reserved for everybody but the Kootenai Indians, they meant.

The shoe was where she left it on the kitchen counter. Size 13 Triple EEE Brooks Brothers with a hole wearing through the sole.

On her way out, the arms of the neglected poinsettias on the dining table seemed to reach out to her. She felt a wave of guilt. Honestly, she wasn't a jealous person. She was a good employee. One who cared about the Inner Horizons kids and wanted them not to suffer.

She emptied out the kitchen teapot and gave all the plants a drink. The image of lonely Dr. Hazey eating Grape-nuts at the kitchen sink in his wingtips sucked the green envy right out of her and she even loaded all the lonely bowls in the dishwasher.

Dr. Hazey. He was crazy as a loon, she supposed, but he was her loon. Now what in creation was she going to do about it? Leverage. She needed some goddamn leverage to get Hazey to do the right thing.

Christ on a crutch.

Right in the middle of the concrete steps where Rusty Harrow had enjoyed his mid-morning snack, she stepped over an empty beer can and a coil of salami skin like a snake. Forget the rigmarole of de-arming and re-arming the security system. She threw Rusty's trash in her purse. It would serve Hazy right if beer dripped on the leather.

06282025 Rusty Crashes and OG Watches Him Die

TODAY IPART 1)

ENDING

2:38 AM

AFTER TWO HOURS OF WALKING, OG HAS BARELY COVERED FIVE MILES.

The cold is creeping up on her. Tiredness dogs every step.

She[']{dir="rtl"}s been following a silver moonlit road that snakes through a endless landscape of white relieved once in a while by purple-dark trees and lavender-shadowed hills that point her south to I-90.

Stranger Road, snowplowed the night before, has a light dusting of snow, just an an inch or so. Churned up ruts and snow muck and hard crust hides a layer of ice slick enough to skate on.

By trial and error, she was forced to perfect a kind of sliding gait on the down slopes. Each step forward involves gliding and making sure not to pick up her heels. As long as she stays connected to the ground, gravity can[']{dir="rtl"}t take over.

When she reaches the steep hill the locals call Harrow Hill, she abandons the skating stride in favor of duckwalking with mincing steps. She is almost at the bottom when she falls painfully hard. One jackboot whipped out from under her and the next thing she knew, she was lying like an overturned beetle on her Hello Kitty backpack.

For a moment, she rests flat on her back in the empty road. Her brain rings like an alarm clock waking her up to bright pain.

A milky wash of stars shines bright as fireflies. The shrillness of the starlight hurts her eyes. Beneath the throb in the back of her skull and the ache of a banged elbow, the ice is freezing cold, unforgiving as granite. She longs for her bed back at Healing House, thinking of the soft flannel sheets, and thick woolen blankets with the quilt from home. She[']{dir="rtl"}s wishing she was still curled up under their weight, listening to Rachel breathe in soft susurrations in the bed across from her. She'd never admit it in Process Group, but she liked the sound of another human in the darkness. It felt good not to be alone, especially after years of keeping herself separate from the world of the living at Healing House.

At this rate, it will take another hour-and-a-half, maybe two, to get to Wolf Road where she has a vanishingly small chance to hitch a ride in the early morning milk truck to I-90. When she reaches the Interstate, maybe she 'll get lucky and catch one of the big trucks hauling a load to Seattle. She'd rather lie there and continue crying, because it hurts. And she's tired. Mortally tired.

That[']{dir="rtl"}s when the low rumble of a loud, grumbling engine reaches her ears. It[']{dir="rtl"}s far off. Coming from the direction of Healing House which is odd because there[']{dir="rtl"}s nothing past Healing House except the Harrow dump.

The ruts in her mind take their usual leap away from the trouble it takes to stay alive. They take their well-worn path to the quickest and easiest way to die.

She shrugs quickly out of her old school pack. Drops it on the road.

She half slips, half-slides down the hill to a blue-dark shadow at the bottom. It's just before the hard left lined by a grove of tall Ponderosas trees and a series of danger signs. No one will see me there, she thinks. She amends her thought to, even if they see me, they won[']{dir="rtl"}t be able to stop.

TOMORROW (PART 3)

COYOTE

2:45 AM

LEAVING BEHIND THE WAKING KITS AND THEIR WHINES, A MOTHER COYOTE pads along her usual hunting trail. She stops to lap at the cold black water of the creek. Then skirts around dark trees, pads across an open meadow, and climbs uphill toward the noise and death road. It is silent at the time of darkness.

A far distant vole, hidden deep under snow, smells interesting but it's safe in its subterranean nest. Her stomach rumbles, reminding her of its growing pinch, the cries of hungry kits now masked by the rush and tumult of the creek.

She edges beyond the trees and climbs a snowy slope, swinging her muzzle side to side, gathering in familiar smells of cheat grass and vetch and bitter brush and aspen under the deep snow. Tree limbs snapped by snow weight release the smell of pine resin. An unfamiliar stew of exhaust and oil and diesel fuel register as past, not present dangers.

On a freshening breeze, a smell of promise reaches her --- enough to make her pause before stepping onto the death road that is silent this time of night. Something foreign, edible, maybe meat, is near by.

She pads further down the road to investigate She's wary. Ready to turn and flee, as she smells a dark shape in the middle of the road that wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t there when she hunted at dusk. It's alive, but not moving. Dangerous. A wisp of sulfur breath rises and hovers a few inches above the mouth in its naked head.

Something good to eat \-- meat? fat?\-- is near. The coyote salivates though she knows whatever is in the road might not want to give it up.

Torn between the desire to come closer and stopped by fear of the unknown, the coyote approaches the dark shape that contains the smell. She nuzzles at unforgiving cloth. Nips, then jerks it away from the two legged thing that is moving and making screeching noises that would scare her if she wasn't so hungry.

The night lights up like a sunrise.

A death roar..

She springs to safety an instant before the snow bank she[']{dir="rtl"}s paused in front of flattens with a crash that tears the night.

RUSTY POV

\#

**3:33 AM**

THE SIX-PACK OF BEER RUSTY HAS BEEN DRINKING is five down, One Rainier left, in a nest of plastic rings. He pats at his breast pocket. Feels for the container key and the zip ties he\'s stashed there. The container is fitted with handcuffs. The new blanket is still in its wrapper. Everything is in the bag but the baby.

Steering with one knee, he fumbles for the last beer, grappling at the plastic ring with both hands. He[']{dir="rtl"}s thinking about whether to circle around back to 7-Eleven for another six-back, or should he do it after. He might be too excited.

Bright feral eyes freeze in the high beams. A red unearthly glow. Darkness made darker by the startled red.

Dog? Way out here?

The truck shimmies and sways. Then the front wheel catches a deep rut. The truck lifts off. He busy wrestling the left-pulling steering wheel, trying to heave the weight around without touching the brake, with one finger still stuck in the pull tab of the beer. The truck, heavy and high weighted with a load of full garbage cans, picks up speed with all of gravity behind it. He doesn't remember the hard left at the end of Harrow Hill until all four wheels are off the ground and the old Ford F-1 launches itself at a looming Ponderosas.

The last thing Rusty sees are his hands thrown up to protect his face from an orange tree that hurtles towards him.

TOMORROW (PART 3 OPENING)

OG POV OF CRASH

3:40 AM

THE ENGINE RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER IN OG's ears. She can see making its way across the flats more than a mile away before it reaches the hill.

It seems to take forever once she lies flat in the road. OG has positioned herself so her body crosses both lanes in order to make herself a bigger target. She's squirming around trying to make herself more comfortable on a cold and unforgiving sheet of ice, when she picks up a strange sound under the hum and thrum of the engine coming toward her.

A GRRRRR?

On then upslope a few feet, where she discarded her pack, Hello Kitty is hopping backwards in herky-jerky jumps, as if pulled by an unseen hand. "What the hell?"

The pack keeps moving. One foot. Another foot.

She jumps to her feet and she sees that a coyote has the pack strap in its teeth like its found a prize.

"Heyyyy! Gimme that. It's mine!"

The coyote keeps jerking purposefully, working its fangs deeper in the trap and pulling in sharp, efficient movements to drag the pack off the road.

OG scoops up clumps of hardened snow and ice and lobs a fusillade at the creature. It lets go and backs few feet away. Instead of turning tail and melting back into the forest, as OG expects, the coyote turns and growls and bares its teeth.

The coyote emboldened by inaction, creeps back on the roadway, fangs visible in the moonlight and growling its unwillingness to let go without a fight. It crouches on all fours, belly to the ground, showing pink teats that are thin and distended. Kits, OG thinks with dismay. She needs to eat to feed her kits.

OG considers what to do for a long minute.

One quivering coyote ear rotates towards the sound of crinkling as OG teases the half-full Cheeto bag out of her pocket with numb fingers. Good thing the Benadryl kicked in before Charlene finished the whole bag, the thinks ruefully.

She underhands a cheese curl at the coyote which makes the creature hop vertically and jump backwards at the same time. Feral yellow glints as the creature cuts its eyes toward the unnaturally orange puff.

Cheeto OG tosses another Cheeto her way but the coyote regally ignores the neon puff.

"They're good." OG tries for a conversational tone. "Charlene thinks so. She's the reason I don't have that many left." A third puff sails the closest to an interested, quivering nose. The coyote maintains a sphinx-like calm as if she has the patience of eternity.

The night is cold but not unbearable, now that she is up and moving. Moonlight reflects the coyote's thick silver coat where it lies, its opposite ear cocked to the rumble of the approaching engine.

A glow like a false dawn rises at the crest.

Empty yellow orbs emerge out of the glow and resolve into headlights. She expects the vehicle to creep slowly downhill, but weirdly, its high beams bounce and jounce as the lights speed up\... There's a thicket of warning signs that scream Slow down! Danger! Left turn ahead! They're mostly buried by head-high snowplow piles.though everybody who drives the road knows there's hard left at the bottom.

The coyote is up and leaping over the berm. Loping toward a grove of tall Ponderosas that line the curve ahead before OG thinks to tell her own feet to move.

OG bolts toward the berm and is half-way up the plowed pile when a huge rattling mass of darkness whizzes r overhead, so close that if she'd raised one arm, her hand would have been taken off with it. The arctic blast on its way by yanks her ear flaps straight up.

SHHHhh-WANNGGGG!

CRAAAACCCCKKK!

THWWWWUMPPP.

It all happens at once. A bomb explodes. A rifle crack of splitting wood. An avalanche of swirling blinding snow. A green truck crashes into a giant Ponderosa tree and OG turns toward the sound just in time to witness power and mass defeat gravity by driving the truck straight up an orange tree trunk that splits down to the heartwood.

For one elongated moment, the truck, still vertical, back wheels spinning, hangs between earth and sky as if its on a direct path to the stars.

When gravity finally reassert is self, the metal undercarriage slip-walks slowly, almost decorously, around the curve of the trunk. Leans sideways. Lands upright, as if it found a nice place to park.

Old Girl brushes furiously at her face. Shards of ice and wetness and road grit cover her as if someone threw a shovelful of slush in her face. Her eyes take a moment to adjust from the burst of brightness back to dim silver light.Inches from the sole of her boots is a huge tire tread in the snow. It swerves past her and drives halfway up the berm before it disappears like a miracle.

Then she is up and on her feet, slipping and sliding into the heavy deep snow of the field in front of the tree grove. She follows a blast zone of sheared tree limbs and broken branches, aware of the strong sweetish smell of caramel that releases when you peel a puzzle shaped bark off a Ponderosa . She stumbles, staggers, wades and plunges through deep drifts to get to the crash.

.

The reek of garbage, cans with their tops popped off, all the content of the staked in the back are in the path of destruction. All OG wants to do is muscle her way to the driver. She can see through the busted out front window a dark hunched form. It looks like the person at the wheel is leaning forward, arms protectively hugging the steering wheel.

No luck yanking either door open.

The impact has pushed the engine block forward and the green hood is jammed between two trees a distance away from the crash, like a turtle blown out of its shell.

Tall around the rubber lining of the windshield, lethal pieces of broken glass stick out like shark's teeth.

She gives up on the doors. Crawls up and a hot and steaming tangle of metal that used to be the engine and stands atop the engine block. Her goal is to kick out the glass so she can get into the cab.

["]{dir="rtl"}Are you hurt?" she calls through the enlarging hole. "Can you talk?" An unidentifiable reek suffuses the truck. The smell of diesel gags her.. It takes a lot of work to kick out the razor sharp icicles so the glass doesn't impale her on the way into the cab. She brushes at the glass with her mittens and sweeps it aside to clear an entrance. Finally because she can't dislodge the last tenacious spikes, she wiggles backwards into the makeshift hole. A gymnastic eel turn and a shimmy deposits her in the front seat that has become a weirdly narrow space between the dashboard and the back wall.

It takes a second to understand why the space is so cramped. The engine, normally under the hood, has been driven forward into the cab and the steering column has driven forward into the chest of the driver.

The man in the driver's seat isn[']{dir="rtl"}t hugging the steering wheel. He\'s leaning forward, his arms wrapped around the column, because it\'s embedded in his chest.

\"Holy shit.\"

She takes in the wet penny smell of blood. Litter everywhere. Paper bags. A tangle of ropes. Hamburger wrappers. Old McDonalds French fry cartons. Styrofoam cups. Some kind of doll thing on the floor.

The dark jacket with neon sleeves and neon hem that glow faintly in the reflected light of an ancient dash. The driver opens dark eyes and he turns his face towards her.with a puzzled expression.

\"Are you hurt?\" she asks stupidly. The absurdity of the question\--for Christ\'s sake the steering column is sticking into his chest!---propels her into feeling around the column to see if she[']{dir="rtl"}s mistaken.

Wet dark stickiness comes away on her fingers. It\'s running down the steering wheel to the floorboards. Motor oil? Lubricant? One headlight stares crazily out at the forest and reflects enough light into the cab to reveal the gash in the man's forehead, a bloody nose.

\"Who are you? he wants to know.

For the first time since she entered treatment, Old Girl answers without thinking. ["]{dir="rtl"}Angela. My name is Angela." What[']{dir="rtl"}s the point of going into the chapter and verse with a mortally injured man about a stupid nickname from another life?

["]{dir="rtl"}Is Rachel with you?," he asks, voice raspy and faint.

The man is filthy. He[']{dir="rtl"}s middle-aged, with an unshaven face and dark hair that[']{dir="rtl"}s stiff with grease. A gash near his temple drips red and he wipes at his nose which is dripping in his lap. He waves his hand vaguely at the steering column. ["]{dir="rtl"}Stuck,\" he says. ["]{dir="rtl"}Can[']{dir="rtl"}t move.\"

It dawns on Old Girl then that the dark flow that is dripping quietly on the floor mat is oozing from the man[']{dir="rtl"}s chest not the steering column. ["]{dir="rtl"}I should go. Get help," a she says.

She has a desperate desire to scramble out of the truck, away from an injury she has no idea how to deal with, but honestly, the only help she can think of is too far away at Healing House. It[']{dir="rtl"}ll take hours the man doesn't t have to get there and back.

Besides, he is already gripping her hand with his own dark, wet fingers. For a man with a steering column embedded in his chest, he\'s got a grip like a tree root, strong enough to break stone. ["]{dir="rtl"}Don[']{dir="rtl"}t leave me alone. I\'m scared," he says, his expression intense with longing.

["]{dir="rtl"}You have to stay awake. Keep your eyes open." Old Girl is thinking about something she read somewhere about not allowing a person with a concussion to fall asleep, a useless fact that\'s stuck in her head with a lot of other useless information that doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t include even the basics of first aid. She tries to avoid count ing the black beads that are dripping down the steering column like ticks of a clock.

\"I didn\'t do nothing," he murmurs into the silence. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s not fair." Old Girl nods, in complete agreement. Life isn\'t fair. She doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t have a steering column sticking out of her chest, for example, when she[']{dir="rtl"}s the one who offered her body up in the middle of a snowy road expecting death to find her. Instead, death circles this unattractive, stinking man so close she can almost feel its wings.

["]{dir="rtl"}Shhhh." Old Girl squeezes his hand gently, then tries to count his thready pulse. Is it multiply by 6 for 10 seconds or is it count the beats for 10 seconds and divide by 6? She gives up because even an idiot can tell that his pulse is racing like a clock that[']{dir="rtl"}s off its rocker. She\'s watching the drops that continue to drip from the column bead and it doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t take long for them to hang for longer and longer pauses before they hit the floor. \"Who knew that he hath so much blood in him." Macbeth comes to her with the voice of doom. Now she wishes she\'d paid more attention in school, especially in First Aid and Home Accident Prevention that Aung Peggy insisted she take. Now she\'s not sure that even if she had paid attention that the instructions would have covered a man who is bleeding to death while holding her hand with a death grip. About the time it occurs to her it is a death grip, she perceives a relaxation of his fingers as if he\'s drifting off to sleep.

["]{dir="rtl"}Stay with me," she says and he responds by making an ineffectual movement to push at the steering column. He raises one shoulder, as if he[']{dir="rtl"}s trying to be philosophical, and says, ["]{dir="rtl"}What are you going to do about it?" He closes his eyes as if he doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t expect her to answer.

The last thing he says, after brushing restlessly at his chest, is, ["]{dir="rtl"}Always rain. Never any goddamned sun."

The tick of a cooling engine. A cold breeze with a few snow flakes riffles through his hair. A rasp of dry wheat chaff exits his laboring lungs.

Something feels enormous.

Ever after she will remember this moment, her first experience in the presence of death. The only time that will come close to the enormity of this feeling is many years later, during the birth of a baby that is so far from conception that it might well be one of the stars lighting up the black night like diamond dust.

His breathing changes quickly from quick and raspy to a long wheezing inhalation with an interminable silence before his mouth opens to breathe again. She realizes that he is no longer gripping her in fear and terror that she will leave. Somehow she is the one gripping him. Doing her best to keep him tethered to this earth, though her strong and youthful grip is weak and paltry in the face of the force that pulls at him.

Would she have hung around for Mom and Dad? Gabe? Absolutely, she thinks, if it would have kept them alive. What about David and Peggy, the people who stepped up after death erased her family and folded her into their lives without question? Does she owe them some connection to this earth?

The weird thing, she realizes, about this small, encapsulated world in the greasy garbage truck is how anchored she feels to it. Someone needs her. He wants her to stay. For perhaps the first time in her life, she herself wants---feels duty-bound, in fact\-- to stay. All she has the tools to do is hold onto another human being. It is what she has to offer among the hamburger wrappers and Chicken McNuggets and French fry cartons, all the throwaways that have sustained this stranger[']{dir="rtl"}s throwaway life, when she realizes she doesn't want this stranger's life to be thrown away now.

His jaw opens and closes twice like a fish without water then opens one last time. His color, when she climbed in the windshield, was flushed with life. Now his lips are thin and pale. At the tip of his nose, he's dusky blue. The same salty blue color of his fingers which are cooling in her hand.

In the moment of recognition that the power has switched off, she holds tight to the man[']{dir="rtl"}s hand, willing the warmth of her own blood and life into s relaxing fingers. A sudden vast longing steals over her. She would give anything to turn back the hands of the clock, to turn back to the moment when his eyes greeted her with surprise and gleamed with flinty life, when she entered the cab.

It is easier this time to exit the cab feet first, reversing her direction from the way she came in, as if squirming out of a birth canal. She floods back through the deep snow and makes her way down to the road feeling new blood pulsing in her feet, the pain like ice crystals tumbling and tearing her veins.

A strange half crab-half doll that was on the floor of the cab nestles in her pack. It has a shaving brush for a head with large goggle eyes mounted to the handle. No mouth. Its arms are mismatched doll parts, one brown, the other pink, while its bottom half, naked as a newborn, has claws for legs. She wonders if she can sell it but who would be crazy enough to buy it? It has a unicorn-horn shell glued to the crotch for a penis!

Her plan is to thumb a ride on Highway 95 which will take her to I-90, then hitch to Seattle, where she intends to ask Eleanor, Dad's sister, now a professor in literature at the University of Washington, to help her get back on her feet.

She[']{dir="rtl"}s wanted to die for so long, it is hard to imagine what it will take to direct her life toward the problems of living. Instead of blowing her nose and wishing she could blow her brains out, she now has to think about where to buy Kleenex.

Life was plenty complicated when all she was thinking about was a rifle for getting rid of postnasal drip. Maybe the truck driver who picks her up will have a tissue box hidden between the seats so she can blow her nose. Or maybe she should use her sleeve. Maybe she should just stop by a 7 Eleven and grab some napkins.

A whole world of possibilities opens up when you are thinking about how to live your life instead of ending it, she thinks.

Meanwhile, she begins to trudge along, seeing dawn lifting the blackness from the night sky and turning it to an intense night blue.

She feels life, painful and biting, rush in to her frozen toes.

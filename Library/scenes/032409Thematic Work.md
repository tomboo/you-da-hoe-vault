032409 Theme work

In my story, all the characters are walking the thin line between life and death. James is pulled to risk: drives too fast, drinks and drugs too much to lose himself, does stupid boy stuff like he's immortal. Rachel hurts herself, cuts and picks at scabs and cuticles until they get infected, she hides the evidence of her pain and flirts with the danger of a staph infection from the sore in her armpit. OG is profoundly unhappy, depressed, in a spiral of descent.

Each scene, each P0V, should show them wrestling with how to grow up and live - how to walk the line upright without leaning too far in either direction. They\'re all trying (and failing) to grow up. Nina asked if the story is about why some of us are saved. All the kids are heroic, they\'re battling afflictions and grief at an early age, before they are equipped (Rachel and OG); James battles himself and his loser self. perception and buries his sorrows in getting stoned and drunk. Drugs, cutting, suicide attempts: all negative ways to deal with life\'s many troubles.

Suicide attempts

Old Girl had three official suicide attempts on her record. Those were the tries that were too obvious to ignore. But she\'d actually been trying to off herself since she was twelve. Her first try -swimming out in the lake and letting herself sink -was foiled by Uncle David, a champion swimmer in college, who pulled her out of the depths sputtering and choking. She had to wear a bright red lifejacket of shame the rest of the summer as punishment for swimming \"out of her depths.\"

120314 Healing House Setting

Healing House was only one of Inner Horizon's psychiatric universe of residences. Dr. Hazey, the founder, had a collection of bungalows and ranch houses and cottages and quasi-Victorian-era boarding houses scattered outside and in the city limits of Couer D'Alene for patients who were intended to graduate from Intensive to Transitions to Supervision-As-Needed (S-A-N! Get it? Jesus H. Christ , it made Old Girl want to puke!) The idea was that the touch of Inner Journeys would stretch like a thinning umbilical chord as patients tried out sanity and either bounced back or bobbed forward into adulthood. SAN-i-fucking-CAN, thought Old Girl.

Old Girl had lived with the Adolescents in a two-story gingerbread cottage. Every time she walked along the white picket fence and approached the chapel gate, she felt like Hansel and Gretel tripping toward the witches oven.

Healing House was the largest of Dr. Hazey's residences. He owned a fleet of bungalows and cottages and farmhouses and Victorian-style boarding houses scatted around Couer D'Alene. Nobody said it, but Old Girl thought it was a hiding-in-plain site strategy that embedded housefuls of crazies in bucolic Idaho neighborhoods with hissing lawn sprinklers in the summer and snowmen and bird feeders in the winter.

Healing House was the first house Hazey purchased. It was a two-winged ranch house that had a third wing added on to it when he decided they needed a Girl's wing and a Boy's wing. At the other bungalows and cottages, boys were segregated from girls by house; at Healing House, the separation was achieved by heavy metal fire doors propped open during the day and shut at night as if sex was a strictly nocturnal activity instead of an around-the-clock hormonal pressure valve. Where there's a will there's a way was how Old Girl thought of it; "don't ask, don't tell" was Dr. Hazey's, not that he'd ever admit it to the certification review board.

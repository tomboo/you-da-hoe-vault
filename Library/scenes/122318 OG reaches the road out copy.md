122318 OG reaches the road out

Small spitting stings of crystallized snow. The explosion looked like white ash but was really ice crystallized crust thrown up into the air and scattered as if by a high wind. Soft, unfrozen snow hung in the air like solid fog for an instant before it buried the truck in a small selective snow dump. When OG looked back from the road, she could barely see the outline of the truck, now on its side, its undercarriage buried half way up to the chassis. A drift had formed next to it, between the great Ponderosa separating it from the other trees. A strange wheel track ran up the Ponderosa trunk which was now broken and leaning backwards as if whatever had driven up it had lifted off and broken free of the bounds of gravity.

The whole experience had been so strong and mysterious. OG chose to stay in the mystery. If she'd had a phone, she would have called an ambulance hours ago. But she didn't. No sense crying over spilt blood.

She plodded forward on frozen feet.

A mile or so later, a friendly milkman in a Pleasant Pastures truck picked her up. The milk man, under many layers of scarf, earflaps, hat, giant mittens and a floor length down coat, turned out to be a milk lady -- something OG figured out by the elderly quaver in the woman's voice when she asked her what she was doing out at the crack of dawn.

OG liked. Said her car broke down for the early shift at McDonald's. The milk lady, a rural Idahoan of indeterminate generations, obligingly dropped her off at the Arches obligingly located near the on-ramp to I-90 eastbound. Idaho -- the old Idaho of her generation was a friendly state where people lived miles apart and didn't drive each other bonzo.

The kids at the Program were strangers in a strange land. Idaho was weird: backwoods as hell, populated by people in big Dodge Rams or Jimmies with gun racks in the back, they were big on hunting and in the fall you'd see pick-ups with deer or elk spread eagled on the hoods. Other urban centers sported cars with Mercedes logos -- small delicate circles -- while in Idaho, they sported a whole carcass of glassy eyed deer with matted, bloody fur.

With cloud cover, the landscape is occluded and oppressive in its closeness. In clear sky with high altostratus clouds, it feels limitless and open. Humans seem like specks in the largeness that stretches North to Canada and north to the Alaska Yukon and onward and north to the great steppes of Russia.

Low cloud cover has flat light, no shadows or variations in light and darks like the high contrast of sun at high noon in the summer.

Lydia is tunnel-visioned at the end; one narrow track that falls off to nothingness

OG's vision opens up and widens out by the end

Coeur d'Alene and the Kootenai Mountains and St. Joe's Wilderness recede in the rear view mirror as OG, now inhabiting the name Viviane, lights out for the territories.

OG settles in to the fuzzy sheepskin covered seat in the semi-cab sleeper and she opens the back cover of Huckleberry Finn. It's her habit to read the end before she reads the beginning; that way she can never be surprised by a horrible tragedy such as the one that snuck up on her in real life. Good, she thinks, as she reads Huck's final thoughts. He makes it.

A happy ending? Not exactly.

More like a provisional ending as she and Huck stumble on to another life away from the one she's left behind in Idaho. Time to move on, though she'll think now and again of Dr. Hazey and his tiny empire in the middle of the Idaho wilderness with fondness. More fondness, it turns out, as the years go on, but that's what comes of lighting out for the territories. A different and wider view grows on her as she grows older and smarter even though she's basically on her own.

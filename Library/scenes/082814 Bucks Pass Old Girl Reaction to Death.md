082814 Bucks Pass Old Girl Reaction to Death

Old Girl is appalled at how hard the man is gripping her hand like she's the only thing keeping him tethered to this earth. She seems like such a weak, paltry thing to hang around for.

Would she have hung around for Mom and Dad? Gabe? Absolutely, she thinks, if it would have kept them alive. What about David and Peggy, the people who stepped up and folded her into their lives without question? Did she owe them some connection to this earth?

The weird thing about this small, encapsulated world in the greasy man's truck was how tethered she felt to it. He needed her and wanted her to stay. For perhaps the first time in her life, she wanted---felt duty-bound, in fact\-- to stay with another human being.

It was a revelation among the hamburger wrappers and Chicken McNuggets and French fry cartons, all the throwaways that had sustained his throwaway life, to realize she didn't want his life\--or hers \--to be thrown away now.

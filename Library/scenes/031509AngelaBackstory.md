Angela's Back Story

Angela just feels hopeless all the time. It's hard to get up, hard to be interested in anything, hard even to breathe. Such a useless effort. They prescribed all kinds of antidepressants: Welbutrim, Lexapro, Paxil, Cymbalta, Zoloft, Prozac, a brand new one three weeks ago called Abilify which she was still taking (they were onto her at med-time, she always got the rubber-gloved finger swab between her lips and gums, under her tongue). She already knew it wasn't working. She felt like the gray, ashen world she was used to existing in had only turned to charcoal.

The thing that was bothering her lately --really freaking her out --was that she was losing her memories of mom and Dad. The color of their eyes. What they smelled like.

Waiting at the door, sweating in her snow gear, reminded Old Girl of waiting for Mom to wrestle Gabe into his snowsuit. Because she was three years older, she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be pressed into his clothes like a sausage. She can still see Mom holding him between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down on his black boot so she could get the fat little foot recorked in the boot bottle. At Old Girl's far removal, she half-imagined hearing a pop when the foot slipped in, like the reverse of a champagne cork's removal. What was Gabe doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the happy, sun-dappled Before of her life, and came up empty. Gabe was a happy baby -- not like her, a colicky screamer according to Peggy, her mother's sister, and now her Guardian with David in the perpetual After. Her mind was a blank. A terrible blank. Something was eating her happiest moments around the edges lately. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. She used to be ask to call up Dad, a builder, by smelling fresh cut wood. When she smelled the broken tree branch she'd finally managed to dislocate from the downed logs at the lake, all it smelled like was wood. Like the sinking elk, he was gone -- even farther gone-than after he died with Mom and Gabe the first time.

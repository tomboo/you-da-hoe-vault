091615 Drawing a comparison between Gretchen and Squealer

This, said Squealer was something called tactics. He repeated it a number of times, \'Tactics comrades, tactics!\' skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. The animals were not certain what the word meant, but Squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions. \"(Page 36-37)

Persuasive/influential: \"A too rigid equality in rations, Squealer exlained, would have been contrary to the principles of Animalism. In any case, he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be.\" (112)

Writing for herself was one thing; writing under duress, like a trained monkey who had to spit out a ten page paper, was another. Old Girl loved her literature class. It was such a joy to escape into a books far from all the bullshit and drama at the Program. Still, you had to pay the piper when a paper came due.

She was trying to draw a comparison between Gretchen's language about nutrition and Squealer's way of making black into white. Squealer used words to twist things and Gretchen who called good old macaroni a "nutritional nightmare" and a "heart attack in waiting" did too. You could bet that if Gretchen talked about how vitamin rich a meal was, you couldn't choke down. If it was fiber packed, you'd be shitting for a week.

By lunchtime, her list of parallels between Inner Horizona and Animal Farm looked like this.

Dr. Hazey = Farmer Jones, former owner of the Manor House

Margaret = Boxer, the hardworking horse that gets sent to the knacker

Gretchen = Squealer, the stand-in for the Communist propaganda machine

Gretchen's food euphemisms ("packed with super-vitamins" "nutritional powerhouse" "fiber-rich" = Squealer's lies

She highlighted in yellow how Squealer convinced the animals that the pigs deserved the best food. "\"Comrades!\" he cried. \"You do not imagine, I hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? Many of us actually dislike milk and apples. I dislike them myself. Our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. Milk and apples (this has been proved by Science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. We pigs are brainworkers. The whole management and organization of this farm depend on us. Day and night we are watching over your welfare. It is for YOUR sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples.\" (3.14) thinking, Oh, holy hell, I've hit the jack pot.

Program rules like "Don't ask, don't tell" = the rules at Farm like "Every animal is equal---Some animals are more equal than others.

She had a hell of a time figuring out who was Napoleon. The problem at IH was an absence of leadership. There was no dictator, no Nurse Ratched who ran amok; it was more like there was a weak non-leader who was always making a muck of things.

The paper wasn't going well. She'd thought it was so clever to drawl the parallels between Inner Horizons and Animal Farm but the only parallel that really worked was that the kids stood in for the animals. They didn't grow things at Inner Horizons but they sure as hell destroyed plenty.

She knew she was on solid ground when she wrote "Danny = Dog Pack Leader." But then, if Danny had the loudest bark and the chomping, slavering teeth, who was Reza? Most of the time he acted like a neurotic stressed out Chihuahua, all needle teeth and high yippity-yips coming out of five pounds of dog shit.

It was easy to pigeonhole Lydia as Rose, the vain horse who only cared about sugar lumps and pretty ribbons. But James? He wasn't a sheep, he wasn't a power hungry pig so what was he. His height made him a giraffe but she'd never seen him try to stick his neck out. It was a good thing that an allegory was a three-legged dog in Professor Larson's opinion. Not everything had to work one-to-one or the fable turned into a fairy tale that nobody would believe.

She returned to contemplating Danny the Doberman. She was definitely bought into the Animal Farm slogan: All animals are equal---Some are more equal than others.

"Smart ass!"

Under her breath, Old Girl muttered dumb ass. If Danny was the lead dog of the pack the pigs brought into enforce the rules, Reza was a snapping Chihuahua. All bark and tiny bites in a five pound sack of dog shit!

She ran through the list of therapists and DBT counselors. Josh? He was the real deal therapist, good with his patients, not full of himself like Darlene who expected you to respect her because of her title. James and Rachel both had Josh for individual therapy and they liked him.

Nobody else had thought to collect Esty from Stabilization after she'd been moldering there for two weeks like something left in the back of the refrigerator to rot.

Esty was a cow or maybe a big calf who chewed her cud and munched grass down to stubble wherever she was staked. She had dim brown eyes with long black eyelashes but when you looked deep into them, the light was dull and blank. All she thought about was hay.

"Stanker!"

"Tanker!"

"Wanker!"

Esty absorbed the taunts like blows. She slumped down and rounded her shoulders as if people were raining blows on her back or poking her sagging stomach.

Old Girl's rules were simple. Mind your own business. Head down. Stay out of the fray. Don't talk and nobody can get close to you. Those rules had seen her through two years of continuous hell. And yet. Her sense of fair play and justice was appalled.

You didn't kick someone who was drugged to the gills. You didn't fuck with them after two weeks in the hell of isolation where even Old Girl had been so lonely and bored she cried with relief when they let her out. Also you didn't pick on someone who was too brain-dead to fight back.

Esty was the size of a dairy cow but inside, in her heart of hearts, she was still a small child.

Esty had the heart and mind of a 10 year old in a three-hundred pound body. How could you enjoy beating up on someone who's idea of a snappy retort was "nuh-unh?"

Esty stared at her plate in misery. The only piece of carb comfort on it was a midget-sized roll and a glop of over-the-hill spinach. The hunger on her face was palpable. She looked like she was resigned to going hungry her whole life.

What moved her, she couldn't have said. Something about Esty's desperation and the acceptance in the at girl's face that this was her lot in life, got Old Girl on her feet and moving briskly down the table. She snabbled the platter of meat loaf and banged it down next to Esty. "Feed yourself! Nobody's going to do it for you!" she cried.

Reza snatched at the platter, intending she supposed, to shove it out of Esty's reach. Old Girl caught him by the wrist and stopped him. "Hey, let me go!" Reza barked.

Old Girl tightened her grip on the boy's wrist and nodded encouragingly at

Esty. "Go ahead," she said. "Fill your plate."

Esty already had her fork and knife at the ready. While Old Girl obligingly held Reza's hand on the table, Esty stabbed down and embedded it tines-deep into the back of his hand.

"Owwww!" Reza squawked. He tried to bolt upright from his chair but Esty threw her torso over his forearm and drove the fork deeper into the tabletop, while knocking Old Girl to the side.

Everything erupted into sound and motion. "Stop!" "Let go!" Crazy cunt!" "Owwwoooooo." Darlene & Gretchen were up and running while Reza's howls rose in volume and Danny's voice joined his in high pitched laugher.

Old Girl backed away from the fray. She watched all the herking-jerking bodies, all the room in motion. Darlene pushed and shoved at Esty, while Gretchen yanked and hauled on Reza's arm causing him to scream louder. Esty grunted as she bore down on him, her face was calm. She hunkered possessively over Reza's slight body and her determined expression made it clear that it was going to take more than just Gretchen and Darlene, relative lightweight women, to displace her if she didn't want to let go.

Wow, she thought. See what happens when you think you're doing a good deed! Still, she had a sneaking sense of admiration for Esty was holding on for dear life. People at the far end of the table were craning to see what happened. Those who were too far away to hear the altercation got up and tried to crowd in close for a better view. Rachel looked shocked, while James looked the opposite of shocked, probably because he knew exactly how much or Reza's assholery could make you lose it.

While chaos reigned, Old Girl decided dinner was over. They were supposed to have pie to celebrate Danny's departure from the Program, but she guessed that was off the table too.

She was on clean-up duty and she'd never seen an Act of God or an earthquake big enough to interfere with that, so she starting stacking dirty plates and piling up the silverware on top. She hip-bumped the swinging door open to the kitchen and was surprised to see Danny there ahead of her.

Old Girl thought, Wow. Who could have predicted that? Still, she wasn't sorry she had acted in Esty's behalf. The poor girl had nobody on her side. Even the therapists barely tolerated her and they got paid to be empathetic. All old girl had done was display common decency by passing a platter of meatloaf and keeping Reza from pushing it out of her reach.

It wasn't like she deserved a Nobel Peace Prize. Still, she was inordinately pleased with herself. Shje'd put a stop to their stupid game. Esty was the one who had acted for herself while Old Girl, with one simple act of common decency, had made it possible.

OG's revelation

Old Girl thought, Wow. Who could have predicted this!

One small act of human decency had turned the tide on the Lord of the Flies and Animal House's pack of feral dogs.

Was Danny Napoleon and Reza was Snowball? Could you be both a pig and a snarling dog at the same time? By then Reza's howls had subsided to whimpers and there was a definite porcine quality to them. He sounded like a little piglet crying for a teat.

Old Girl thought, Wow. Look at what I did. She was used to keeping her head down and resisting all efforts to engage. A shy feeling of pride and a sense of accomplishment snuck up on her. It felt like she'd be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and all she'd done was pass the meat loaf to a hungry girl.

Who knew that Esty would feed herself so well?

Old Girl thought, Wow. Look what I did. It wasn't as if she thought she deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for passing a platter of meatloaf. But there was a shy and undeveloped part of herself that was proud of herself for standing up for another human being.

Old Girl backed away from the melee and watched the jerking-jerking bodies all around the table with a strange feeling of accomplishment. Never in a million years could she have predicted the power of passing a platter of meatloaf. She was inordinately proud of Esty. She was also proud of herself for her small part defeating Reza and Danny at their bullying game.

In the kitchen

Danny was glaring at her with a glob of yellow custard clinging to her chin.

It was not easy to show respect, much less keep a straight face, to someone who had a glob of yellow custard stuck to her chin.

Buoyed by Esty's results with Reza, Old Girl decided Danny wasn't as tough s she thought she was. Sure, the girl was taller but Old Girl, thanks to her hours on the treadmill, was in better shape. Plus, she had surprise on her side.

Plus Danny wasn't expecting a challenge from Old Girl who had a reputation for keeping to herself.

She felt shyly proud of herself. It was like she'd defeated Jack and his band of feral shits and Napoleon and Snowball and their pack of mean dogs too with the simple act of passing a platter. Yay, meatloaf indeed.

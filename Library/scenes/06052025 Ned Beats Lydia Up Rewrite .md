06052025 Ned Beats Lydia Up Rewrite

Everything is funny to Jed, especially a half-deaf, y blind woman stumbling around in the snow in wet socks.

Frankie tells Jed not to harsh his mellow. Beating her makes her look like shit. Why would you fuck something so unattractive with blood coming out of her ear and snot dripping from her nose. You told me she was cute. Look at her, she's wearing clown makeup. No front tooth i.What is she, a meth head with only snaggle teeth left in her gums? Look at her, she can't even stand up straight and with all that moaning who's in the mood, especially after shooting Red Bull and Vodka.

She's a punching bag for a while but when Jed orders her to her knees to give him a blow job, there's nothing to blow because Jed is too full of Red Bull and vodka to make his dick wo. Frankie's is too fearful, or maybe just nto self- preservation to even look at Lydia. "I can't," he's apologizes to her as she's about to jump him when she can barely stand. "I'm married."

At some point, it starts to dawn on her that maybe Frankie is on her side. Frankie's the one who rescues one of the boots that Jed yanked off her feet and tossed across the clearing into the mouth of a busted out TV. He tracked down the other boot from where it got hung-up on a low-hanging tree branch and dumped the snow before he hands it to her.

Frankie gives him a second tab of Ecstasy and after that he loses interest in fucking her up and fucking her and it isn't long b before he's singing along to the stereo speakers blasting from the truck. "Good Night Irene" he warbles like a hound dog without an awareness of pitch and when Honky Tonk Woman 's backbeat bass starts to pound, he drops the rifle he's been carrying around like a guerrilla fighter and tries to get Frankie to two-step with him which makes them both look like bears circling for a fight.

Eventually Franke steers her back to the truck and while Jed is off pissing on the far away lights far below, he takes off his own socks and pulls them over her blue-white feet that are devoid of feeling. He chafes the skin to force the blood back into her skin and keeps telling her "it's not that cold out --- it's above freezing tonight, you shoulda been here last week when it was down to -10. "Just walk around and get your blood moving," he says after zipping her into his jacket that smells like motor oil but feels heavenly because she's shaking like an aspen leaf.

He's right about her stumbling around. Something is wrong with her balance and she lists in a circle, until to go straight until he pushes her toward the truck and whispers to her to get under the moving blanket in the back seat. Maybe he won't notice you're there, he says, like he's talking to himself.

Jed's a mean drunk but the second tab of Molly turns him into a sad sack and then he's blubbering about his old dog Irene who had distemper when he was little and died while foaming at the mouth and he thought his dad had washed the dog's mouth out with soap.

The shift in the playlist to Shania Twain has him bellowing at the stars "You don't impress me much." When a full moon peaks its silver head from a bank of clouds, he goes on a mad hunt for the rifle. He b wants to shoot the eyes out of the man in the moon so he'll give him some cheese.

Frankie, seemingly unfazed by Jed's devolvement from terrifying to start raving mad, drinks beer and eats most of a bag of Cheetos until his mouth is an orange as his fingers. He offers her some but she isn't hungry and besides, she doesn't think she can chew where he tooth broke off.

In Frank's war socks, with her boots back on, now zipped into a puffer jacket Frankie pulled out of the truck, Lydia is feeling like maybe she'll serve the night. Frankie snags the skeet gun from the busted out oven where Jed left it and starts cajoling him to get back in the truck to warm up.

He beckons at her behind his back ut she can't figure out why he keeps signaling her to hush.

"Shut up why?" She mumbles, only realizing her mistake when Jed's piggy red eyes narrow on her and seems to wake up again to the rage and simmering anger that fuels him when he punched her to get her in the truck.

"You," he said, snake-eyed and blame-ridden. "You're the one that got me into this mess," he said. He's waving around at the busted out TVs and the snowy mattresses with gouges with gray padding hanging out of their ticking and sprung coils that poke out of a box springs like projectiles. The garbage people used for target practice was baffling. Why would you haul a heavy crapped out refrigerator miles into the back woods for fun? The No Dumping sign had been inked over to read, "No Humping."

Frankie told her to get in but Jed moved faster than her and shoved her away from the step she'd been about to climb up. She fell on her knees and her hands went up like a supplicant.

"Make her walk," Jed said, like he was kind of all he see. "She's not good enough to ride in my Raptor."

"It's 3 miles back to '90," Frankie said. "She's in no shape to walk.

"Shoulda thought a that before her and her fat friend fucked me up." He adds, as if this adds insult to injury. "And they ruined my Louisville Slugger."

Jed's Molly-mood switched from mellow to murderous in the space of five seconds. He stomped around the truck and go in the driver's side. The a automatic locks sounded in the quiet of the clearing like the action of a rifle bolt..

"Uh, oh," Frankie eyed Lydia with a hang-dog look. "I was afraid of this."

The Ford 150 was already growling in low gear. Frank shoved Lydia out of the Raptor's path as Jed careened backwards in a wide, off-center circle toward the windy road down hill.

Frankie ran like hell after the truck, catching up to it as it slowed to make the turn. He pounded a fist on the driver-side window. Which Jed rolled it down, laughing uproariously. "Got you, you cocksucker! Got you good!"

"Fucking cocksucker!" Were the last words Lydia heard Frank yell, as he stood on top of the riverside running board and clung to the door handle, and managed to get his other hand on the rear door handle for slightly better grip. The last sight of them she had of them was Jed rounding the bendt downhill, The gate of the Raptor, which no one had remembered to close, swung wildly banging open and shut like a drum that was off rhythm. The massive tires, Grapplers or Grabbers, Lydia was never to know which, vibrated violently and whined as slush and snow rose up behind the Raptor's red lights like a rooster tail. All that was missing was the squawk.

On her knees as if in prayer position, Lydia hears the growl and hum of the big engine and the big tires for a long time. She holds her breath hoping they won't come back. Blue silence is stealing over the silver light in the clearing when she realizes she's surprised she didn't die there with them.

It will take awhile as she puts one step in front of the other, before she figures out her fate really hasn't really changed. She's going to die all right, because she can't feel her feet or her hands.

"Let's take its for a run up to the Shooting Range. Put her through her paces."

Jed's eyes light up and Lydia realizes before Frank does that he's not referring to the Raptor. "You mean for target practice?"

Lydia doesn't usually second guess herself, it's one of her more attractive personality traits she's been told, but she can be forgiven for wondering how-in-the-hell she could have chosen today of all days to be early to the van pick-up stop on the one day in a thousand that Margaret was late. If luck favored the prepared, Lydia knew she was nowhere near ready for the night ahead.

A broad thumb is visible in the gap between the seats at it hammers down on on index finger that's points at her like a pistol.

Back story

Frankie's a mechanic at the Ore-Ida Potato processing plant where he runs the chip line. He's knows how to fix the finicky fry line and gets it going when it breaks down. He's in his mid-20s, it's a good job, but he's still figuring out the fine line between how to make rent and partying too hard. It's Friday night and Ned's just somebody his older brother knows and somehow when he runs into him at the factory Ned's brother runs, he gets roped into partying with a guy who's never grown up and doesn't have to work for a living.

"ran't you friends," Lydia says.

"With Ned?" Frankie rubs the sparse hair on his chin that would look better if he shaved it off instead of trying to look older. "I ran into him at the plant when he came in to meet with my boss. My boss is his brother."

He covered her up with the moving blanket, tucking it in like she was a small child. "Keep quiet back here and maybe he'll forget you're with us."

"He told me you got him beat up."

"Me?" Lydia thinks of Margaret whaling him on the back with her felt purse and can't imagine anyone would think he got a beating. "What did he tell you?"

Franking said he didn't know the whole story except she --- Lydia --- was the reason he was wearing a neck brace the day they ran into each other on the job.

"You know Margaret O'Leary?" Lydia asked

"Sure. She's the mom of one of the guys I went to high school with. Charlie O'Leary."

Small towns, where everyone was related by blood or getting beaten up on the playground.

"How come you helped him get me into the truck?"

"He said you stole money from him.'

"He paid me for a blow job. That's the only money of his I took."

Frank rolled his eyes. "What the hell am I doing here?" He said, half rhetorically. "That guy's always been a piece of work."

Behind him, Need loomed over Frankie like a bear standing on his back legs. "What the fuck are you two doing?" He shouted.

"She's freezing," Frankie turned without any reaction, but he kept his body between Lydia and the door opening where Jed was crowding him.

"Who gives a shit? I don't."

Frankie changed tactics, as if he was taking Jed's side. "I don't either. All I care about is doing some damage to the rest of this vodka. He smoothly brought an almost full bottle from the front of his coat where he must have hidden it into Jed's view.

His ruse would have worked fine with Jed hadn't had a sudden jones for a cigarette.

LYDIA DEATH SCENE

A gold and silver glow sweeps above her from her hiding place deep in the tree well. The glow travels with the low growl of an engine with a distinctive tire hum. She doesn't understand that it's Frankie, now at the wheel of the Raptor with Ned passed out cold in the passenger seat. She thinks the warm yellow glow is the perfect reminder of the warm gold stamen of the glacier lilies she sees poking out of a frozen snow drift in spring time.

Lydia comes to in the back seat of an unfamiliar truck during a long argument about Nitto Grappler s and Grabber HTS60s. The Mud Tired looked a hello lot more aggressive and the Grabbers had better mileage plus way ass better traction in snow. Hell, even Pirelli Scorpions would have been a better choice. She had no clue who Jed was talking to but she could tell he was getting pissed off and frustrated because the guy with him knew more than he did by a mile.

He'd been alone when he forced her into his metallic red truck at the van stop where she'd arrived early for once in her life to surprise Margaret. She'd told Lorenzo that she wanted to turn over a new leap and he told her not to take such big leaps, how about just show up when you said you would. Ergo early on the one-in-a-thousand days when Margaret was late.

She'd managed for a while to elude him while he chased her by dodging between bushes and trees,- she hadn't realized he was such a fat fuck and out of shape --- until she tripped and then he was on her cand hoking her by the neck while punching her with a closed fist Ito the ear. She kept looking around hoping someone walking on the late afternoon campus would see him forcing her in the truck but classes were still in session and the dinner rush hadn't started.

Now she was lying on her stomach covered by something thick and quilted. Her hands were jerked viciously upward behind her with something sharp cutting into the flesh of her wrists that her feet were attached to. One shoulder twisted uncomfortably under her body weight.

"Frankie, you butt-fucker," Jed was saying. "I know my truck better than you do. I bought the best there is."

"Yeah but I know what the poke is better than you, numnuts. I've used the same lift package and installed it myself."

Lydia's was trying to roll over to take the pressure off her aching shoulder,. She could have moaned for all she knew because her head was splitting and her ear ached. The blanket that was making it hard to breathe was yanked off her head making her blink against the sudden light.

"What the hell?" a man in the front seat was saying. "Who's this?"

"I told you about that cunt who took my money." Jed was looking uncharacteristically sheepish. His voice had an edge to it she had't noticed, a kind of defensive, over-explaining edge to it. "I'm teaching her a lesson."

The man he called Frankie said, "Jesus H. Christ, you got a underage girl hidden under a blanket i and she's hogtied like a prize steer. What the hell am I supposed to think?"

He wore a mechanic's blue jumpsuit with an Ore-Ida logo on the sleeve and looked appalled;. "Did you fucking kidnap her?"

The guy was now pushing the blanket that covered her up further away while trying to lift ta sticky mat of hair that was stuck to her cheek and neck. "She's bleeding, you chicken gizzard. Did you do that to her? What the fuck?"

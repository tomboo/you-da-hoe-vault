063015 James Burning Question

Why was James's sister Susan the brilliant one, the one who got into Dartmouth early decision, and he was the dumb one? He refused to think about the hours and hours Susan spent in her room or at the library studying while he was out partying or stoned on weed leaving his homework to get done (or not) in the 10 minutes between class changes. Was it a girl thing that plain and freckled Susan did what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by a flurry of texts and IMs from his pals?\
It didn't seem to him when he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on weed or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka from his dad's liquor cabinet\-- that he had trouble staying on task or that he got easily distracted.

Once in a good moment with Dr. Mom, the neurologist and brain surgeon whom Susan was a clone of, he asked her why he and Susan were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system can talk to your frontal cortext."

He'd looked up the limbic system that he now understood as the lizard brain where all his fears and fuck-ups lived, he assumed. The frontal cortex housed the decision-making parts of his brain.

He commented to his mom when they were having pizza on the way to abasketball game that his frontal cortex must be the size of a walnut." Oh, no, James," she said. "It's the right size. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to your limbic system yet. You don't have enough connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections. "Time," she said, matter-of-factly. "Only time makes the brain connect."

Maybe that's why Susan had a high round forehead. All those connections she was making when she got straight A's in AP classes when he barely got into Cal State with a basketball scholarship. All Susan's connections made her brain bulge out and James' lack of them went to his flat feet.

It wasn't like James had grown up unloved or neglected. Sure, he and Susan had nannies when they were little but Dr. Mom and Dad always made time for them. Dad came to all his basketball games, even when he traveled, and Mom made him videotape James's games if she had a long surgery so she could watch them later. She complained bitterly about Dad's shitty camera work so she must have watched quite a bit.

James just seemed unable to stop himself from any shiny thing that called out to him. A party tonight in the Canyon? Susan would have said, "I have to study for my Calc test." James would text A3. Anytime, anywhere, any place.

He could make a pact with himself to stay home and work on his California State History paper that was due tomorrow and then the texts would roll in and he'd soon he'd be texting back ZZZZ. Then it would be 7K. Then pretty soon it would be FKIT.

One of the stupid family stories Dad loved to tell was about the day he had to leave a board meeting because James bit one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's kids at pre-school.

"I get to the preschool and James and the Schwarzenegger kid are having PG&J sandwiches and grape juice," Dad would say. "There's the Schwarzenegger with his arm around James, sharing the sandwich." Then Maria Shriver calls Mom and says James left a perfect bite mark on her kid's left buttock."

"'Bit your tongue next time,'" Dad would say. "Or at least wait till after the board meeting." As if James could control his urge to strike out which was the same as his urge to act out. The second an idea formed in his brain, it just seemed like he had to do it. There was no planning involved. The impulse came and he bit down.

Dr. Hazey

Dr. Hazey's burning question was, Is this all there is?

After Alma left him---he was blindsided with no idea that she was unhappy---he sat for longer and longer periods at his office desk looking out on the frozen lake, unable to do anything productive. A stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical health care premiums awaited his review. A performance review for Darlene, the earnest but dour head therapist remained unsigned for the last two months. He could always justify taking a rest from his responsibilities. Once he stopped working, he couldn't get up enough steam to get restarted.

He checked the clock again. Another two hours before he could reasonably down another muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less walk across the room to greet Rahel Bronfman now --er? Lydia's mother had been remarried and divorced in the time that Lydia had come into the program. How was he supposed to keep up with her last names?

Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, Old Girl was one of his few regular patients. He'd dropped all his other long term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and keep up with the managerial load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had almost completely deserted his life while P&Ls and cash projections ruled his life.

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised that he was so attached to her. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep her on his crowded schedule even though it was hell to keep seeing her 3 times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for the founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include Angela Livengood. She made him laugh She continually surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her razor wit and her surprisingly adult insights. And if he didn't get through to her, he was deathly afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey's burning question was how to get through to Old Girl's depression and suicide ideation. Suicide had been so much of part of her, he couldn't seem to jolt her out of her rut. It was like she'd been on the path to her own distruction for so long that the dirt walls had built up over her head while the path she walked cut deep into granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair she could barely see the stars above her.

He was a shit. He was lazy. He was unproductive. He wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for pick-me-up before his session with Old Girl.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make me feel like even more of a shit heel, though he doubted that was her intention.

Like all teenagers, she was self-obsessed and solipsistic. And he couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a beautiful young woman would wear those dry carboard scraps stultified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with 9 weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her sexuality and she buried it in matted hair that looked like dessicated Medusa snakes.

Didn't she want a boy friend? Sure, HGazey himself made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horions from becoming a bed-hopping swap fest. But he would make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way than sex with one of her peers. That boy from Malibu---John? Justin? Jamison?---was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for a drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing someone with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed. There was a reason for the No Fishing Off the Company Dock rules. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice yioung man at NICC in one of her classes. If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe, just maybe, Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought. The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the drug candy.

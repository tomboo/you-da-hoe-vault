Process group 1st scene

Rachel\'s blue eyes were wide with wonderment at the frozen white peak ringed by blue-black trees

Rachel\'s glacial blue eyes were wide with wonderment at the view of the white silent wilderness. Frozen white peaks, frozen blue foothills ringed with frozen blue tress. What was so awesome about deep freeze stretched all the way to the gray concrete clouds overhead.

Darlene,

James didn\'t bother taking off his damn ski jacket. He was always cold, coming from Malibu California, no matter whether he was inside Healing House or out in the below-zero Idaho spring. Spring had sprung in Malibu but here in Idaho it cracked like ice under pressure.

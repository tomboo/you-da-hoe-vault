Death Scene from Old Girl Perspective

What does Old Girl think? She doesn\'t want to see the vehicle hurtling toward her. Doesn\'t want to witness gravity and tons of metal speeding at her to crush her into a bloody spot. Why look at that? Why not have her last image be of something beautiful. Her mom used to say, \"It\'s a beautiful world,\" at the drop of a hat; why shouldn\'t Old Girl\'s last view of life on this shitty earth be inspiring.

That\'s why she\'s staring at the Ponderosa Pines \_\_\_\_ the winding road. There\'s a sharp curve the grinding wheels of the oncoming car is approaching for she can see the hop and flutter of headlamp beams on the trees. The lights catch the caramel colored bark, lighting one then another massive tree and she\'s thinking about the smell of caramel mixed with vanilla when you peel the puzzle shaped pieces of bark off the tree. Why does it smell sweet? She\'s thinking, expecting a heavy weight \_\_\_ oblivion any second.

A giant bang tears the fabric of her \_\_\_\_. A scream of metal. The crash and roar of splintered wood.

Old Girl is on her feet and scrambling up the high berm of snow on the roadside before she even realizes she is moving. Her feet feel numb and she\'s wobbly on her feet, falling and slipping on the slippery bank toward a \_\_\_\_ engine and still spinning wheels of a crumpled truck.

The engine is still running. High beams light the dark forest at a crazy angle. The truck has hit one of the tallest pines head on and the front end has wrapped itself like a lover around the splintered trunk.

She falls, two, three times before she can get to the driver\'s side door. All she can see inside is a dark narrow form lunged forward with arms protectively hugging the steering wheel. No luck yanking the bent door open. The glass on the side window is crazed but holding still together. She scrambled up on the crumpled hood that\'s \_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ the tree like it\'s bestfriend and kicks at the broken window using the blunt toes of her pack to break out the glass that\'s still clinging to the rubber molding like jagged icicles.

After kicking out a hole in the glass big enough to let her in she brushes at the glass shard with her gloves trying to clear a path. Finally she just bucks into the hole using her boots to kick inside the \_\_\_\_ shards and with a gymnastic turn and shimmy, manages to deposit her gun next to the driver in a weirdly narrow space between the dashboard and the rear window of the cab.

It takes her a minute to understand why the space is so cramped. The engine normally under the hood has driven itself forward into the cab and the steering column is pushed into the chest of the driver. He\'s not hugging the wheel she finds. He\'s leaning forward and his arms are wrapped around the steering column because it\'s embedded in his chest.

\"Holy shit,\" she breathes and to her amazement the man\'s head turns toward her and he opens his eyes. He\'s looking at her expectantly like she knows something he doesn\'t and she has no idea what that might be. \"Are you hurt?\"

The ridiculousness of the question \-- for Christ\'s sake the steering column is sticking into his chest! \-- makes her want to take it back. So flummoxed for what to do, she leans over and reaches for the ignition key and turns the engine off.

The high beam staring crazily up at the snow colored branches is still on. It turns enough light in the cab to see the man\'s face, pale in the snowy light. Black/\_\_- hair framing a puzzled face.

\"Who are you?\" he asks.

She\'s not going into the chapter and verse about Old girl and how she got the name. From the look of him \-- it\'s too dark wet seepage that\'s \_\_\_ dripping down the steering column to the littered floor \-- she doesn\'t think he\'s got that much time. So she says for the first time in several years of purgatory at the treatment program, \"I\'m Hope.\"

\"Hope,\" he says, his voice scratchy. \"That\'s pretty.\"

He doesn\'t say anything for a while. Old Girl is trying to count his \_\_\_\_ pulse \-- it is multiply by 6 for 10 seconds or is it count the \_\_\_ for 10 seconds and divide by 6 \-- and she gives up only \_\_\_\_\_ that his pulse is both \_\_\_\_\_ and it seems super fast like a train pulling out of the station and speeding up.

\"I think I should go for help,\" she says but the man has turned his hand over and gripped her fingers when she was contemplating the meaning of his \_\_\_\_ pulse. For a man who has a steering column embedded in his chest he\'s got the grip of Hercules and he shows no intention of letting go.

\"Stay,\" he says. \"I don\'t want to be alone.\"

She\'s watching the drops that are spreading over the column and dripping like ticks on to the floor mat. \"Who knew that he hath so much blood in him,\" a phrase from Macbeth maybe. She wishes she\'d been paying attention in English class, any class really, especially First Aid and Home Injury Prevetion, some stupid class they made her take when she wanted to become a Certified Baby Sitter.

Now she\'s not sure that even if she had paid attention in class that the instruction would have covered the situation she finds herself in. A dying man holding her hand with a death grip. About the time she \_\_\_ of his death grip, she perceives a lessening or a relaxing of his fingers as if he\'s drifting off in sleep.

\"Don't close your eyes,\" she says. She\'s thinking concussion, something that\'s stuck like a lot of other useless information in her head about not allowing someone with a concussion to fall asleep. She keeps a wary eye on the big \_\_\_\_ above his eyebrow as if that will keep the man with her in the cab and tries not to count the black beads that are slowing in their flow.

They don\'t say much to each other. She tells him her name, Hope. \"Pretty,\" he says. He says, \"Don\'t leave me.\" She nods. Tightens her hold and telegraphs her grip on him through her fingers.

His breath is raspy with an undercurrent of scratching and pops.

She feels like she\'s in the presence of something enormous, something important and that she can\'t describe. She holds tight, willing the warmth of her own blood and life into his cooling fingers. It doesn\'t take long \-- or maybe it takes forever, because time seems to stop in the cooling cab as he quiets between breaths. She counts five \-- no seven \-- slowing breaths when his mouth opens and closes and the pauses between breaths lengthens and slows. On the sixth breath she thinks he\'s gone. Then his mouth closes a final time and it\'s utterly silent except for a light gust of wind that riffles the papers on the dash. She\'s not sure but she thinks the paleness of his face gets bluer, more dusky, until his lips which used to be pink with life go dusky and white as salt.

She turns the lights off. It\'s the last thing she does before she backs out of the cab feet first reversing her direction from the way she came in, as if she\'s pushing and squirming out of a birth canal.

It\'s easier this time to climb the tall berm the snow plows have left and she makes her way back to the road and starts toward town with both feet firmly under her, feeling the blood pulsing in her feet, the pain of new blood flow scratching the ice crystals that were clogging her veins.

She\'s got the strange man\'s doll with the unicorn-sharp shell for a penis in her pack. Instead of a head, it\'s got a shaving brush with Mr. Potato Head eyes goggling to both sides on metal springs. Its mouth is a pair of girly lips made of bright red plastic, smiling and full. The rest of the body, made of doll parts, is naked like a newborn. She\'s not sure why she felt the need to take it with her on the way into town, \_\_\_\_\_ on to \_\_\_\_ ride on I-90 to Seattle where she intends to make her way to her aunt and uncle to ask them to help her get on her feet.

In the meantime, she\'s just walking and feeling her life, painful as it is, come back to her frozen cells.

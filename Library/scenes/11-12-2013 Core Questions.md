Lydia\'s Mom

\"Mom\'s coming. Mom\'s coming!\" One of Lydia\'s earliest memories was of skipping down the long skating rink of a hall of Grandmama\'s mausoleum in Grosse Point. Her nanny had told her that her mother who\'d been on a trip to Greece, was coming home. For hours Lydia skated the hall in her bare socks. Back and forth. Back and forth. Finally her grandmother told her she\'d wear out the floor boards if she didn\'t quit. What was funny about the memory is that Lydia didn\'t remember very much about the actual visit. A cloud of perfume. Her mother\'s assessing voice. \"My, you\'re not very big,\" as if Lydia was found wanting. It was the expectation of her arrival that stuck with her. The feeling of being held up and inspected. The feeling that her hair was too curly or her legs too thin or her voice too loud, made her mother\'s visits both wanted and when she got there, unwanted because Lydia always found herself coming up short or skinny or once, \"a little Jew,\" something her mother told her grandmother with a dismissive toss of her head.

Later, when she lived with her mother, she learned to have no expectations. If she was there, it was more like she wasn\'t there and maybe that was the reason she had such a visceral memory of sliding along the waxed floor. It felt like she was flying with her hands up ready to catch the thing that was coming with great joy.

It was only when she got what she was expecting that she realized her hands were empty.

She left the alley feeling hollowed out and she stopped at the corner to decide whether to kill time by shopping at the shitty low-end shops in downtown Coeur d\'Alene or walk back to campus.

Across the street, she saw Lorenzo exiting the Povarello Center wearing a big back pack with a steel frame. He looked like a mountain man off to the back woods. He untied a wolf-size dog from a parking meter.

\"What are you doing here?\" she called across the traffic.

He crossed over to her, the dog trotting behind him. \"I live here.\"

\"Isn\'t that a homeless center?\"

He shrugged. \"I told you I got thrown out. It beats sleeping in the park on a bench.\"

Lydia automatically reached for her wallet. She was so used to having money she forgot for a moment that her checkbook and her credit cards and a pile of cash had been taken from her and locked up in the program\'s safe. All she has in the wallet was \$3 in change for coffee

\"What are you looking for?\" Lorenzo said.

\"I was going to give you money for a hotel but I forgot they took away my credit cards.\"

\"I don\'t need a hotel. The POV Center is fine. They\'ve been letting Joseph Smith stay in the mud room.\"

The dog bared its canine fangs and settled with a whimper at his feet. She held out her hand tentatively to let him smell her but he emitted a low humming sound, part warning, part question mark.

\"He\'s protective,\" Lorenzo said. \"Keeps me safe.\" He looked around. \"It\'s not the best neighborhood. What are you doing here?\"

She wasn\'t about to tell him about the lure of Dunkin\' Donuts and its handy dumpster. She could almost smell the sweet reak of vomit following her the short distance from the alley to the stoplight where they were standing.

\"I want to do some shopping,\" she lied.

\"With no money?\"

\"It's called window shopping," she said. \"It\'s not a crime.\"

He shifted the weight of the backpack on his shoulders. Then picked up the rope that served as the wolf dog\'s leash. \"I gotta go,\" he said. \"I don\'t want to be late for my job.\"

\"I didn\'t know you worked.\"

He looked at her, one eyebrow lifted quizzically. \"You don\'t know much about being homeless, do you?\"

She shook her head.

\"Work. Paycheck. Rent money?\"

She felt stupid. Thoughtless. She was still holding her empty billfold which probably cost more than he made in a week.

\"See you around,\" Lorenzo said.

\"Hey!\" she called. \"Where are you working?\"

\"McDonald\'s,\" he grinned. \"Ever heard of it?\"

\"You\'re mean,\" she said.

\"That\'s because I live on the mean streets,\" he said.

She walked back to campus with detouring to any of the shops on Main Street. What she wanted wasn\'t in any stupid Idaho shop. It was serving hamburgers and French fries at the Arches.

Lydia\'s Scenes

2\) James blows Lydia off

3\) Meet up with homeless Mormon kid at the coffee shop when he asks her on a date

4\) Lydia is hungry: binging and throwing up behind Dunkin\' Donuts

5\) Chance encounter with Lorenzo, the Mormon kid, at the Pocatello Center

6\) Lorenzo tells her how he got thrown out by his family

7\) With James in the bathtub, giving a blow job

After that, Lydia and Lorenzo started meeting at the cafeteria at the 10-11 o\'clock break between their classes.

They both saved up their change and made a show of buying the other one\'s coffee like it was a four-course meal. He was broke; she was broke. It felt even-Steven but also fair, which was quite a switch for Lydia whose Jewish grandmother had drummed into her that a lady lets the gentleman pay. It was true that Lorenzo was the most gentle man she\'d ever met.

It was on one of the days that she paid that she asked him how he got thrown out by his family.

\"I don\'t think you\'d understand,\" he said. \"It\'s a Mormon thing.\"

\"Did you break some rule? Have sex with the minister\'s daughter?\"

\"We have deacons.\"

\"The deacon\'s daughter then?\"

\"Nothing like that.\" He stirred more sugar in his coffee \-- he\'d already dumped in two packets, and added a third.

\"Source of nutrition?\" she pointed at the stack of empty packets.

\"Got a sweet tooth that won\'t quit.\"

\"Tell me,\" she said. \"I\'m not going to judge you.\"

\"It\'s not me I\'m worried about,\" he muttered.

The only thing Lydia had learned in the hours of individual therapy and Group grope was that talking about your hurts, as horrible and flesh tearing as it was, did make you feel better. Not immediately, of course. Not while you were trying to ensure the feeling of being flayed down to subcutaneous flesh only to see that you were seething with blow flies and maggots.

\"So I told you I grew up in Utah. A little town called Hilldale.\"

She didn\'t know Hilldale from J\_\_\_\_\_ but the name seemed important to him.

\"It\'s a polygamous community. One of the early Mormon settlements when Joseph Smith and the prophets settled in Salt Lake. It was kind of a splinter group that broke off from the main church when the stake cracked down on multiple wives.\"

Lydia sat forward on her chair. She wished she\'d paid more attention in American History back in grosse Point but she\'d been more interested in boys from about 13 on. \"Multiple wives? Like one man and a bunch of women?\"

\"Not usually a bunch. More like two or three depending on how wealthy the man is.\"

\"What does wealthy have to do with it?\"

\"If a man marries two or three wives, he\'s got to be able to pay for their housing and food and take care of the kids.\"

Exaltation and \_\_\_\_ to highest degree of celestial kingdom

\"My dad died when I was little. My mom remarked when I was 11 to a man with four wives and 23 kids.\"

\"Wow.\" All Lydia could think of was how big the dining room table had to be to seat that many people.

\"His name is Lorenzo Heriman \-- and he\'s a son of a bitch.\"

She\'d never heard a swear word come out of Lorenzo\'s mouth. It seemed to underline his attitude to his mother\'s husband.

\"What\'d he do?\"

\"When I was 17 I got friendly with a girl he had his eye on. He threw me out the day I turned 18. He said it was because I was legal, but he just wanted to get me out of \_\_\_\_ so I didn\'t get in his way.\"

\"Hold up a second,\" Lydia said. \"Lorenzo\'s got four wives, including your mother? And he wanted another one?\"

\"He\'s a goat,\" Daniel shrugged. \"I was surplus, so he gave me \$100 and put me on a Greyhound bus to Salt Lake City.\"

\"What\'d your mom do?\"

\"You don\'t understand. What could she do. When you go into a plural marriage, the man is God. You\'re sealed forever.\"

\"Sealed? As in locked up?

\"No, sealed like in a religious ceremony. It\'s a fundamentalist Mormon thing.\"

\"How\'d you get here?\"

\"One of Mom\'s cousins lives here in Sand Point. I stayed with him for a couple months but he lost his job and I was making it hard for them.\"

He finished the last sip of coffee and stood. \"Now you know why I drink coffee. I kind of lost my faith along the way.\"

Lydia didn\'t know what to say. The story was so astonishingly surreal. Lorenzo might as well have told her he\'d been abducted by aliens and then jettisoned over Coeur d\'Alene in a parachute.

\"Do you talk to your mom?\" she asked.

\"Not a lot. When I can afford to call,\" he said.

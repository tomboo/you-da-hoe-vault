010218 Lorenzo plotting

What if Lorenzo walks to the bus stop with the Lieber bag hanging from his arm and Lydia\'s last sight of him is through the back seat window of Ned\'s trucks as he\'s sitting down to wait for her?

Lydia would think of her last sight of the big man-boy, imagining him still sitting on the bench patiently while she is walking the long and cold trail through the blue night to tell him she is sorry for being the bitch she could never help herself from being. Jed's bitch slapping drives the thought into her with the regularity of a piston driving a nail. \"Bitch-cunt, bitch-cunt,\" he repeats, punctuating his words with slaps on either side of her head. Is this what has caused her balance to fail and her left ear to bleed something black and sticky down the neck of the down coat?

OG POV

She was surprised to see that guy who Lydia was friends with \-- Lyall? Laurel? Louis -something---at McDonald's. He arrives right before her on a bicycle in the McDonald\'s lot and he is putting on a paper hat when she walks up to the counter on a mission to get napkins to blow her nose. The paper sat on top of his rusty curls like a clown cap two sizes too small and he\'s bobby-pinning it in place so it doesn\'t fall off. She recognizes him from the student union building at NICC where she\'s seen him talking to Lydia.

The mountains that were blue-dark on the walk from the crashed truck to McDonald's transform on her way out of town.

An orange- pink glow replaces the night blue peaks and fires the dusty, grimy, snow berms along the highway into bands of color as the truck rolls west out of Coeur D\'Alene. Lydia\'s bulky friend, the one with the red clown hair, served her in his little paper hat and even though she only paid for a small coffee, he pours her a giant Grande\' size slug of coffee. He called to her on her way out the door, saying, \"If you see Lydia, tell her I sold the cat bag.\" Old Girl doesn\'t have the heart to tell him she\'ll never see Lydia again because she and her dog-eared copy of Huck Finn, which she has lifted from James\'s stash, are lighting out for the territories as soon as she can catch a ride from a friendly trucker. Her mother\'s youngest sister teaches English lit at the University of Washington. In a few minutes, Old Girl will hook up with a talkative Budweiser beer distributor on his way to Seattle and dopey, gray Coeur D\'Alene will be newly shining with a baby\'s pink glaze of sun that used to be hidden by the blue mountain slopes. A soft cold blanket of white will cover Lydia until spring when two first graders get off the rural school bus and are greeted by Ralph, the family dog, with a small white hand in its mouth.

OG caught a ride right after that with a friendly trucker who was hauling beer for Budweiser to Seattle. The town of Couer D;Alene was just blinking awake. Golden lights winked on as the dawn lifted in a blush of pink from the cold blue night.

\"Tell Lydia I\'m sorry. I sold her bag, like she said.\"

\"What?\"

\"Tell her I sold her kitty cat bag like she said. I\'ll pay her back for what I got.\" Old Girl doesn't say she\'ll never lay eyes on Lydia or Dr. Hazey or Margaret again because, in just a few minutes, she\'ll meet a talkative Budweiser Beer truck driver who will give her a ride and drop her off in Seattle on an I-5 off-ramp a mile from the University.

\"Sure thing,\" she says, though she knew she was done forever with snow and cold and crazy people like Lydia who couldn't help themselves.

Old Girl will fulfill her plan to light out for the territories with a dog-eared copy of Huck Finn, pilfered from James, in her backpack and she will not think of the large, sad boy in the paper hat or his message for to Lydia for years. Not until the day she recognizes Rachel on her way to a class at the UW Medical School while Old Girl herself is finishing a post doc in comparativel literature.

Among other things, Rachel will tell her about how Lydia\'s body was discovered later that spring by two grade school children who were greeted at their bus stop off Wolf Road by the family dog who carried Lydia\'s white hand in its mouth.

Rewrite of OG end scene

Old Girl will be surprised in an hour when she finally stumbles in to McDonald\'s yellow brightness by a friendly greeting from a boy in red clown curls wearing a paper hat.

\"You\'re Lydia\'s friend, aren\'t you,\" the McDonald\'s man-boy says.

\"I know Lydia,\" she says carefully.

\"Tell her when you see her that I did what she said. I sold her cat purse.\"

He hands her a large cup of steaming black coffee even though she only pays for a small.

\"I\'m not sure when I\'ll see her,\" Old Girl tells him. She waves one hand at the rushing, flashing ribbon of light coming from the cars passing by on I-90. \"I\'m headed out of town.\" The McDonald\'s employee doesn\'t look like the type to rat on her to the police but then, the guy in the truck didn\'t look like the type to hold her hand an ddie on her either.

\"Well, if you see her,\" he says, \"just tell her thank you. I didn\'t get cheated.\"

\"Okay.\"

\"Would you like fries with that?\"

She had been sucking down the coffee in scalding gulps, trying to make it reach as far as her frozen toes which were starting to shoot pins and needles in her toes.

\"If I see her, I\'ll tell her.\" She volunteers this knowing it\'s what the solemn man-boy is hoping to hear and she won\'t think of this moment again till many years later when Rachel calls her late one night in NY when she\'s on the tenure track in the English department at Columbia.

Rachel will be married, with one child, and she\'ll tell her how her life has been (\"good\", \"finally sane\") which is code for surviving with a lot of the same scars as herself. They\'ll talk about crazy Dr. Hazey (\"certifiable\") and Margaret (\"Probably running the place by now\") and James whom Rachel lost touch with when she left the Program. When the conversation turns to crazy Lydia, Rachel will tell her the story of how Lydia\'s body was found one day in the spring, when snow melt was pouring into Lake Coeur D\'Alene, and the warming roads were churned with mud. An 8-year-old sister and an 11-year-old brother were met at their bus stop back in the hills near Hayden Lake by the family dog with Lydia\'s hand in its mouth.

\"Did Lydia just walk away like I did?\" Old Girl asks Rachel.

Rachel doesn\'t know, says nobody ever knew, though the police said her skeleton showed broken bones and missing teeth.

The teeth detail will remind Old Girl, known as Angela for lo, these many years, of that friend of Lydia's, the McDonald\'s employee, and how he smiled with a huge gap in his mouth the morning she left Couer d'Alene. He smiled so wide, saying Lydia would be happy to know that when he sold her bag, he hadn\'t gotten cheated.

Rachel's \"take care\" on the phone will sound just like it sounded from across their dorm room every night at Inner Horizons. The coffee in OG's hand, steaming from the cup she has just poured from the department's Bunn coffee machine, will taste like a pale memory of how hot and strong that sip from the McDonald\'s cup felt going down her throat.

She hangs up thinking again of the pain, how terribly pinching and painful it was, how the pins and needles poked her, as the cells in her toes began to wake up in the heat of the trucker's cab.

How much it ached to be alive.

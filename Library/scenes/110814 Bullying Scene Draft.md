110914 Draft

Late afternoon. What Old Girl's mom used to call Cyanide Hour. Esty had just gotten back from Stable in a haze of Seroquel or Ziprexa or whatever anti-psychotic they gave her at the medical gulag they called Stabilization to calm her the fuck down.

Nobody would say officially what set her off. The fat, lardy girl was always prone to wall-staring and carpet watching but in the past couple weeks, she'd gone off like a lit match three times. The last straw was when she'd clocked the night supervisor with a hair dryer. Maybe she had brain damage. Dropped on her head as a baby? Old Girl remembered her coming into the Program straight from the hospital after some kind of car crash not long after her arrival. A big scar zippered her bovine face through one eyebrow and she lumbered with an odd, halting shuffle like a knee or a hip was messed up.

About the only rule at Inner Horizons that Old Girl agreed with was the one that forbade you to tell people what was wrong with you. God forbid you should want to share your troubles! "Don't ask, don't tell" worked for Old Girl and frankly, Esty was too retarded to tell a joke much less whatever her medical history was.

All the kids at the Program hated her because she had no sense of personal boundaries and she didn't like to bathe. Once, Old Girl went with her to a dentist appointment in downtown Couer D'Alene and Esty dropped her pants in an open alley and peed like a cow pissing on a flat rock. A passing car honked when they got a load of the big white moon of her ass.

She was generally musty and unwashed and after two weeks at Stable, she was completely rank. "Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Go sit over there," Danny told Esty when she tried to sit down with Danny on the flowered couch.

When she turned to sit on the other couch, Reza held up two fingers at her like a vampire cross. "Don't you dare!" He threw his feet up on the worn plaid so there was no place to sit. Esty finally just sank to the floor next to Old Girl's chair using the flat part as a backrest. She bumped Old Girl in the ankle and she moved away with a jerk.

Usually, Esty didn't bother Old Girl that much. At least she wasn't a blabber or like Danny, a champion complainer. Today, though, in her zombified sad-sack state, Esty looked so lumpy, Old Girl couldn't stand looking at her. She wondered if general blobbiness and abject misery might be catching. It was bad enough to be her own sorry self without taking on Esty's problems.

It was one of those days when everybody wanted to poke a stick in somebody else's eye. Too cold to walk around the block. Van in the shop. So no grocery shopping or prescription pick-ups. Not even a stupid trip to the post office to distract them.

Darlene, who was on duty, tried to cajole the group into going out to build a snowman like they were all six years old but nobody would bite. Everybody had homework, or Accountability Reports or Personal Writing to do but once Darlene's back was turned, nobody did anything except pick on Esty.

"Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?" Reza, the motor-mouth ex-meth addict, loved an audience. "A smart ass!"

Old Girl muttered "dumb ass" under her breath. Picking on Esty was like punching a bowl of Jello. Fat, drugged-out Esty just absorbed the blows with a quiver. She wasn't quick enough to make snappy comebacks or defend herself. An hour before when Darlene and Marjorie half-dragged-half-shoved her into the living room, she'd been miles away, so far deep within herself, she could barely blink

Around dinnertime, Esty lumbered off to the bathroom. While she was gone, Reza and Paul got to arm wrestling on the floor. One of them kicked over a glass of water on the end table next to the orange couch. They ignored the spill, just let it soak into the cushions, not that pilling orange couch hadn't seen worse.

When Esty came back, she immediately sat on the wet spot. Everybody whooped with laughter. Her face was blank as a cow. No idea why everyone was hooting.

Jesus. Was Esty so slow she didn't feel her butt getting wet? Apparently.

Reza, with a weaselly gleam, said, "You just went to the batroom. How come you peed in your pants?"

Esty wrinkled her forehead. "I didn't."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

That made people howl like hyenas. You could almost hear the gears in Esty's drugged brain clanking toward the feeling of dampness on her pants. She stood up and turned a broad, cottage-cheesed ass to the group and tried to peer at herself over her shoulder as her hand groped at the dark spreading stain.

The real reason Esty ended up in Stable was because her roommate Danny had tattled on her for wetting the bed. Last week, Old Girl had been in the kitchen when Darlene told Margaret they needed to order a rubber sheet for Reza's bed because he kept soaking the mattress.

If Old Girl had been a bed wetter, she would have kept her mouth shut about somebody else who couldn't control their bladder. Apparently Reza's strategy was to pile on someone weaker with both feet and his kidneys the second he got the chance. Was it because hurting someone else felt so much better than being hurt?

By then, the whole group was jeering. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Stinker!" "Stanker!" Piss Queen!" Nobody came to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit, Old Girl told herself for perhaps the hundredth time.

Esty threw Old Girl, a sometime ally, a look of silent pleading. Old Girl wanted to stab her herself for being so stupid. Such a fucking victim. "No wonder Esty stinks," Old Girl called out. "She's piss poor at holding her water!"

When Darlene finally called them into dinner ("Meat loaf, yay!) it took Old Girl a few minutes to figure out what their next little game was.

Paul picked the seat across from Esty and Danny plopped down beside her while Reza took the chair on her other side. When the meatloaf dish was passed to Danny, she took a slice, then slid it across the table to Paul, who sent the dish down the opposite side of the table away from Esty. Reza speared a boiled potato and sent the serving dish the opposite direction. He repeated the action when the butter came to him, then the gray peas. The only food that was allowed near Esty was the undressed spinach salad (therapists doled out dressing)garnished with two paltry egg slices and a lone mushroom.

"Hey, Leia, " Esty was eyeing the rapidly emptying meatloaf platter. "The meat loaf skipped me."

Leia made wide, blue eyes at her. "I passed it to you. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Of course she did," Reza said smoothly. "Right after I passed you the potatoes."

The only thing on Esty's plate was the lone dinner roll the Program allowed people on the "high energy protein" diet. Skinny Paul, on the high fat diet, was busy shoveling glops of butter onto a mound of potatoes the size of Mt. Spudmore. "What?" Paul said, looking up. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't."

Darlene, sensing something amiss, interrupted her rant about black ice and called down from the head of the table, "Esty, how come you're not eating anything?"

Reza turned to Esty and flopped a gush of naked, wilting spinach on top of Esty's dinner roll. "Have some greens, Es. They make your shit smell sweet."

For a second, Old Girl thought Esty might sob with frustration. She was frowning down at the spinach like it was garbage and when she picked up her fork, Old Girl expected her to use it to flick the crap to the floor. Instead, Esty gripped the handle in her fist and drove the tines into the back of Reza's hand.

Reza screamed. He tried to bolt up from the table, but was stopped midway by Esty who threw her considerable bulk over his forearm and drove the fork deeper into the tabletop with her fist.

"Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated a babble of voices\--"Bitch!" "Esty, let go!" Stop! Stop!"---while Leia's high pitched laugh went on and on.

Esty reached across the table with her free hand and dragged a slice of meatloaf from Paul's plate. She chewed thoughtfully while Darlene and Reza tried to dislodge her grip which had successful pinned Reza's hand to the table between thumb and forefinger.

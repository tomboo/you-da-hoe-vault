Plot Point 2 Touch Scene from You-Da-Hoe Novel

Edited down to 584 words (from 851)

This was not Old Girl's usual wanting and hoping to die. This was garden-variety flu. If she was lucky, maybe cholera.

In her fever-chilled dreams, a distant siren howled like a baby. The mwah-MWAH-mwah-MWAH worked its way under the blankets and the longer she tried to ignore it, the louder it yowled.

She gave up on sleep and peered through a crack in the blind. She wasn't crazy. A red fire truck was rumbling up the snow-packed driveway to Healing House.

She clawed the heaviest Pendleton blanket off the bed and wrapped it around her shoulders, Indian-style. By the time she crept down the hall, using the wall to steady her, firefighters were boiling through the entryway.

All she could think in her addled state was that the arsonist was back. She couldn't smell a damn thing through the clog in her sinuses. Where was the smoke? The axes? The hoses? Why weren't they herding people out?

A dozen or so firefighters milled around the living room watching two men who seemed to be trussing a boy on the carpet, packing him in white waxy paper like a sausage.

It turned out they were pulling a white sack up and over a pair of skinny legs. Black and white Addidas-clad feet, skinny black hipster jeans, then a Bard College sweatshirt that had seen better days, disappeared in the sack . She caught a glimpse of a white angular face with a scruffy beard -- nobody she knew---before a female firefighter expertly tied a half-hitch at the top. A body bag? Old Girl had witnessed some weird stuff on the plaid couch that was front and center in all kinds of peer group shit, but this was the weirdest.

Margaret was standing with her back to Old Girl, being hugged and patted by a firefighter. "I tried... tried...," she kept stuttering until her words rushed out all at once. "hisheartwouldn'trestart!" The red, man-sized plaid shirt she wore had somehow rucked up, calling attention to a square and motherly ass.

"How long did you do compressions?" the fireman asked.

"Twenty? -- maybe twenty-five minutes?" Margaret blew her nose into a handkerchief. "I called in to dispatch, then rolled him onto the floor."

"He was on the couch when you found him?"

"Laid out cold when I came in from those fucking raccoons."

The front door was propped open. A cold breeze from the snow-drifts dusted the entry with a sprinkling of ice.

She let out an inadvertent moan. Margaret's head jerked up from the firefighter's shoulder. "Oh, honey, what're you doing out of bed!"

Margaret abandoned the firefighter. "You don't need to see this," she was saying as the white bag rolled by on a gurney like a mystery that would never be explained.

Margaret's meat-packer arms went out and the next thing Old Girl knew---she, who never allowed herself to be held, who always shied away from contact---Old Girl found herself folded onto Margaret's size Double-D bosom. She smelled faintly of Tide and wet dog.

The steady lub-lub-lub of Margaret's heart was amplified by the great breasts pressed up against Old Girl's ears like two flesh-and-blood conchs. Instead of feeling smothered, she was shocked at how safe she felt, how the heat of Margaret's body seemed to fuel a crack in the frozen lake of Old Girl's heart.

Old Girl leaned into Margaret's pillowy heat, away from the wind blasting Idaho's winter through her nighty. She let Margaret pat her with warm, chapped hands.

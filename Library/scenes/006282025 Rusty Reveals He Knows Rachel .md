006282025 Rusty Reveals He Knows Rachel

The man whispered like he didn't have the energy to speak aloud. "All I wanted was a girlfriend. Somebody who'd be nice to me."

"Everybody needs that" OG agreed.

"That's why I set up the container so nice."

"Oh?" Who knew what container he was talking about but it seemed better to keep him talking than to focus on the steady plink-plink-plink of dark blood that dropped from the steering column, as if from a precipice.

"You're warm," he said a little later. "Shoulda brought along that new blanket. I was saving it for her."

She let him talk as his mind wandered. It was like having his body pinioned in place opened up the desire to wander.

"You can give it to her later," she said. "When we get you out of here."

"Too late." He sounded philosophical. "Story of my life."

Later he returned to the theme of lateness. "It's too late now. I was hurrying to get there early."

Empty beer cans and Chicken McNuggets and Tater Tot boxes and Slushee cups littered the cramped space. Idk anyone wanted to track his whereabouts for the last year, they could have picked through the garbage that had rearranged itself in the crash as it wanted to haunt him.

"You're warm," he said after a long silent spell. "Wisht we had something to wrap around us. I bought her a new blanket. It's back at the container.

"You bought your ... Mom? A blanket. That was nice."

He shook his head but the minute movement made him wince. "Never had a mom. Your girlfriend."

OG decided the stress was rattling her. She wasn't hearing right. "You mean your girl friend."

The same head shake, a bigger wince. "You live with her. She's better lookin' than you."

Now she really felt she'd landed in an alternate reality brought on by the millimeter of seconds it took the crash to scatter all its pieces. She hesitated, then foraged on, "You're not talking ab out one of the girls at the Program?"

"Rachel," he said. He promptly coughed up a dark gout of blood that darkened his chin with more gore.

"How do you know Rachel?"

"Never met her." A circular argument for the new universe she'd was starting to believe in."That's why I bought the new blanket. 'S in the back of the seat." He gestured behind him when she looked where he was pointing there was only a thin gap that might once have been cubby hole now that the bench seat was jammed against the steel cab.

If there was a blanket, it was never going to warm the driver nor OG nor Rachel unless the Jaws of Life came with a bunch of EMTS and a fire truck and a miracle that wasn't likely anytime soon.

"I'm so goddamn cold," he said. "Will I never be warm?"

It's the last thing he says, amid a few stuttered moans and tossing of his head, as if he wanted to get to whatever he was late for. Snow drifted through the busted out window now and then and eventually spangled his hair.

The black night shifted to a glacial blue and the stars she was so happy to see light her way across the endless field winked out one by one. He hadn't moved or muttered in a long time. His face looked quiet now, dusky blue with a rime of hoar frost in his hair that turned him prematurely old.

OG was weirdly energized from the garbage man's death. It was like her closeness to that tiny slit in the universe where he escaped wired her with awe and mystery. OG had experienced the aftermath of the gap, the emptiness, the longing for the ones she was separated from, but not the actual slip through the pinprick's of the universe that seemed opened by the stars.

Because she'd been dozing --- lightly --- closing her eyes now and then from tiredness and the cold, it seemed as if the man who was was tethered to her by a steering column rin the cab, simply floated up and away.

"I wisht I had a girl friend," he said. "Just once. Something of my own that no-one for once could take away."

**SESSION X: X/X/XX**

**NEW + GOOD**

Please share what went well since our last check-in. Feel free to list as many wins as you like because you cannot build on success you don't acknowledge!

**TRICKY BITS**

Where did you struggle (if anywhere)? Are there any craft or story questions that you would like to ask?

**ACCOUNTABILITY SINCE LAST DEADLINE**

Give me an update on your writing. Did you get everything done that you wanted to? Please list what you still want to complete, and/or what your next items are, so I can hold you accountable.

**FOCUS FOR THIS DEADLINE**

What would you like to accomplish in the next month.

**NEXT STEPS + ACTIONS**

We'll compile this action list at the end of our session based on what we work on when we meet.

060416 Lydia has a session with Josh

Darlene had a migraine or some such which is why they had to shuffle around therapists and Lydia found herself looking up and up at Josh from her yoga position on the floor in the Crying Room.

He looked kingly with his dark ebony skin and light yellow-green eyes that seemed to look right through her. About the only thing she knew about Josh besides the fact that he was black, was that he was also James[']{dir="rtl"}s therapist. She[']{dir="rtl"}d asked about him one time and James said he ["]{dir="rtl"}was okay" which mean that he wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t a dick or an idiot or a suck-up like Lydia[']{dir="rtl"}s therapist in Detroit. But who knew. Maybe what was okay for James was a nightmare for her. It all depended on his agenda.

["]{dir="rtl"}What are you working on with Darlene?" Josh was reading notes from her case file and she wondered why he didn[']{dir="rtl"}t just cut to the chase and get down to it.

["]{dir="rtl"}She wants to know why I like sex."

Hmmm. His white palms shone through his dark fingers like the light was trying to bleed through. ["]{dir="rtl"}Sex with anybody in particular?["\
"]{dir="rtl"}Everybody in particular," she said.

["]{dir="rtl"}Are you not very particular? Is that what she[']{dir="rtl"}s trying to get you to think about?"

Okay, they were down to it. ["]{dir="rtl"}She wants to know why I like sex with people who don[']{dir="rtl"}t care about me."

["]{dir="rtl"}Did you come to any conclusions?"

Lydia sighed and sat up. She tucked her tights-clad legs into a reverse yoga cross, feet laid parallel to her thighs. ["]{dir="rtl"}Isn[']{dir="rtl"}t the answer in my file?"

["]{dir="rtl"}It says here you like to play games. With her."

["]{dir="rtl"}Is that on page 1 or 100?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Both," he said.

She smiled despite herself. It was so much easier when a therapist had a sense of humor.

["]{dir="rtl"}She made me write about it this week," Lydia offered.

["]{dir="rtl"}Want to share?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Not especially. Do you want to talk about your sex life?"

["]{dir="rtl"}That[']{dir="rtl"}s fair. But my wife wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t appreciate it."

Hmmm.

He continued perusing the pages, occasionally flipping back to a place he[']{dir="rtl"}d stuck his finger in to mark it. She could guess what that was. ["]{dir="rtl"}How do you like Darlene?"

["]{dir="rtl"}I don[']{dir="rtl"}t want to have sex with her, if that[']{dir="rtl"}s what you[']{dir="rtl"}re asking."

["]{dir="rtl"}It wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t, though it says here you[']{dir="rtl"}ve asked her to have sex..." here, he flipped back to the finger placed mark, ["]{dir="rtl"}three times. Was that what she meant by game playing?"

["]{dir="rtl"}One way to have sex with someone who didn[']{dir="rtl"}t care about me."

["]{dir="rtl"}So you didn[']{dir="rtl"}t want sex ... because she cares about you?"

She was surprised at where his questions were leading her, since she[']{dir="rtl"}d thought she was leading him. ["]{dir="rtl"}No way! She[']{dir="rtl"}s old... way old. And wrinkly."

["]{dir="rtl"}She[']{dir="rtl"}s 38. Same age as I am."

["]{dir="rtl"}You look younger."

["]{dir="rtl"}Is that a compliment? Or a prelude to sex with you?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Do you want it to be?"

He set the manila file on the table. Walked around the front edge of the desk so he was in her field of vision and he waggled his dark fingers at her. ["]{dir="rtl"}How about you stop with the games and read me what you wrote. I[']{dir="rtl"}ll let you know if you convince me."

The way he said it made her think of some old story she heard at synagogue crèche one day while Grandpa Ben was two floors above her listing to the rabbi sing through his nose. King Somebody -- David? Ben Israel?---raised a baby up over a chopping block while two mothers wailed. Convince me why I shouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t cut this infant in half, the King roared.

She scrabbled around in her back pack and drew out a note book with a large black doodle of hearts and flowers in letters that read, ["]{dir="rtl"}Fuck me." She[']{dir="rtl"}d spent the last couple of days adding answers to the question of why she shouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t have sex with people who people who didn[']{dir="rtl"}t care about her. Every time a new answer occurred to her, she started out with the word ["]{dir="rtl"}Because" and she was surprised to see how many pages she[']{dir="rtl"}d written since Monday.

*Because it fills up the time* flitted through her consciousness but she decided not to jot it down because Josh would think she hadn[']{dir="rtl"}t done the assignment if he saw her writing in it last minute.

He sat straight on an austere hard backed chair and something about his calm air of centeredness made me want to move from the nubby couch to the seat in the corner of the plaid couch right next to him. She cleared her throat and read in a low monotone.

Why is sex is better with people who don[']{dir="rtl"}t care about you?

***Because*** sex can be a transaction with clearly defined boundaries and no leakage except of bodily fluids, thus there is no confusion about why you[']{dir="rtl"}re doing it.

***Because*** if James or Jed or Austen the therapist who got fired for having sex with me because I was his patient---because if any of those sexual partners liked me, it would be evidence that they were fucked up. If they wanted me in their club, I wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t want to belong to it.

***Because*** if they cared about me, it would be cloying or suffocating or pushy or like being in a prison under someone else[']{dir="rtl"}s control.

***Because*** if they cared about me, they would expect me to care about them back and that[']{dir="rtl"}s way too dangerous. Leave them before they can leave you first and no one gets hurt.

***Because*** people who don[']{dir="rtl"}t care put up a reasonable facsimile of caring; they fondle and pet and kiss and lick just like the real thing and it[']{dir="rtl"}s easy to close your eyes and imagine that this is the way it should be.

***Because*** I can control the where and when and in what orifice depending on how I want them to get off. Want to do it in the closet outside the Principal[']{dir="rtl"}s office and wipe your spunk off on the hem of Mrs. Daily[']{dir="rtl"}s raincoat? That feels good. Want to stand behind me on the gym balcony parapet and fuck me from behind while the Pep squad performs below us and the squeak of the rubber shoes on the floor boards covers up your groans? Exciting. If you can imagine it, I can make it happen for you because there[']{dir="rtl"}s no limit to the power rush I get when you breathe in my ear, ["]{dir="rtl"}Lydia, you make me fucking crazy."

***Because*** the whole point is not for me to get off, the point is to get you off and make you want me again and again so I can say, ["]{dir="rtl"}No thanks, I[']{dir="rtl"}m bored," when you want me so much you[']{dir="rtl"}d put your dick in my mouth in front of your mother.

***Because*** having sex is like blowing your nose or throwing up some bad chicken or watching yourself bleed from a self-inflicted cut. It[']{dir="rtl"}s just one way to feel something in a cotton wool world. Because taking a dump doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t always work as well.

***Because*** a numb, cotton wool existence is relieved by a flash of red, bursting light. You feel alive and in control of your essential self for a short, instant until the brightness dims and you[']{dir="rtl"}re dwindle back to gray.

***Because*** it feels like they care about you. For one clawing, reaching instant when your partner trembles on the edge of losing his essential self, you[']{dir="rtl"}re the only thing in the world. Is it like the vampire feels as the victim jerks when teeth as sharp as a needle break through skin?

***Because*** love isn[']{dir="rtl"}t doled out along with the condoms in the machine. Use your quarters for something that doesn[']{dir="rtl"}t leak.

***Because*** not caring keeps things polite. It[']{dir="rtl"}s bad form to pretend the act has meaning when all it is is ["]{dir="rtl"}put Tab B in Slot A" until you explode.

***Because*** sex smells good, especially if you[']{dir="rtl"}re out of expensive perfume. Guys smell it on you and they always want their spunk to replace the spunk that came before.

**Because** a young body deserves an old body[']{dir="rtl"}s gratitude.

***Because*** I didn[']{dir="rtl"}t study for my algebra test and it is easier and takes less time to give a blow job to do 20 differential equations.

**Because** every long white bird looks better in a nest.

The pause after Lydia stopped speaking lengthened into a ticking beat of the case clock in the corner and the whoosh and hum of air flowing through a duct. ["]{dir="rtl"}So good work," Josh finally said. ["]{dir="rtl"}Very thorough. Thought out."

["]{dir="rtl"}Did I do it right?" she asked.

["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}m not sure there is a right way to answer that question."

["]{dir="rtl"}I meant... umm... did I explain myself? Convince you?"

His light eyes were locked on her but there was no come-hither expression on his face. ["]{dir="rtl"}You convinced me there are a lot of reasons why you do what you do. Some of them make sense."

["]{dir="rtl"}So I[']{dir="rtl"}m not crazy?"

["]{dir="rtl"}You can be crazy and still make sense, Lydia."

This was either the longest or the shortest therapy session in her entire experience. Time seemed to bloom outward at the same instant it fell inward and she felt as if Josh was looking through his tented X-ray whitened fingers and seeing her naked, shriveled soul.

["]{dir="rtl"}You use sex for barter, sex for boredom, sex for penance, sex for power, sex for comfort, sex for money..." He ticked off a lengthening list and she realized he[']{dir="rtl"}d been taking notes why she was reading. The list went on and on. "...sex for shock, sex for ego gratification, sex as a substitute for a thank you note, sex for notches on your belt, sex for food or rides or cigarettes..."

He looked up at that point. ["]{dir="rtl"}Do you smoke?"'

She shook her head. When he turned quizzical, she explained, ["]{dir="rtl"}It makes your breath smell bad."

["]{dir="rtl"}So why the trade?"

["]{dir="rtl"}Cigarettes are money at Program. If you have cigs, you don[']{dir="rtl"}t have to do chores."

["]{dir="rtl"}Did I miss anything? Anything else you use sex for?" Josh asked.

For one of the few times in her life, Lydia felt a kind of awe and pride at the creativity expressed on the list.

["]{dir="rtl"}It helps you lose weight?" she asked. ["]{dir="rtl"}You know, because you[']{dir="rtl"}re burning calories."

["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s not on the Weight Watcher[']{dir="rtl"}s point system," he said without cracking a smile. But then he said, ["]{dir="rtl"}If you take an average size man and roll him off of you, you could lose 180-hey, 200 pounds of dead weight."

He was joking? A choked kind of laugh escaped her like a fart.

["]{dir="rtl"}OK, oh wise one, you have to use that big brain you[']{dir="rtl"}re so used to hiding under all those curls. What is missing from this list? What do most people want from sex?"

For the life of her, she couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t think of anything that wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t already on the list in the neat girlish handwriting drilled into her by Frau Goering at the Swiss finishing school.

["]{dir="rtl"}How about love?" Josh said. ["]{dir="rtl"}Common caring? Comfort? How about a sense of safety? Warmth? Self esteem?"

It was Josh[']{dir="rtl"}s plain speaking and surprising insight that spoke to her. She didn[']{dir="rtl"}t exactly believe him but she didn[']{dir="rtl"}t dismiss what he said out of hand which is what she was used to doing when Darlene hectored on and on.

["]{dir="rtl"}Where[']{dir="rtl"}d you learn to do this?"

["]{dir="rtl"}What?"

["]{dir="rtl"}To flay your patients alive," Lydia said. ["]{dir="rtl"}You burn their skin off and then rub some gravel in the red part for good measure."

["]{dir="rtl"}Thank you, I think."

The case clock had bing-bonged the half hour and they were already five minutes over. ["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re welcome, now let[']{dir="rtl"}s see if I can ooze myself out of here before you say anything more cruel."

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re a survivor," he said. ["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re think you[']{dir="rtl"}ll break but you can bend pretty far before that happens."

" Is it possible to ooze to death before you bleed to death?"

["]{dir="rtl"}That too," Josh shocked her by patting her lightly and warmly on her upper back. In all the time she had been at Inner Horizons, she could not remember a time when someone had voluntarily touched her. Therapy was therapy; God forbid they made you think they cared.

Huh, she thought as Margaret[']{dir="rtl"}s van splashed towards her at the pickup bench which was lumpy with clotted snow. That didn[']{dir="rtl"}t go like I expected.

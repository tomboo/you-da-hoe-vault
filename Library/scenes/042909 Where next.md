I have a closed society where action and drama have to be intrinsic to the issues and psychology of each character. Need to up the drama both directions: past and present.

Illicit sex

Running away

Stealing

Bird dismemberment

Interactions with people there've hurt (parents, siblings, friends, teachers, staff)

Drug smuggling into house

Mean shit: kids ganging up on one person, shunning, tattling

Atkinson has characters you care about: Interesting, action oriented, heroic even. She is in their heads in a witty way, making a joke of "she would buy the flowers herself "as a nod to VA Woolf. But drama permeates the stories. Joanna's family's murders start the story off with a bang. Reggie's life is threaded with tragedy: mum drowns, Billy the brother is a vicious runt, Billy's gangster friends torch her flat and hurt her, Joanna is kidnapped, Alison Needler's husband is a constant tension & threat until he kills Louise's boy officer, there is the burgeoning love interest between Louise and Jackson, Jackson's duping by Bernie and the wife, a gigantic train wreck with multiple deaths and Jackson\'s life at risk when Reggie saves him.. Never a dull moment.

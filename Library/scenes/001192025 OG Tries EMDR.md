01192025 OG tries EMDR

One day, Hazey surprised her. She had a habit of walking around during the slow moments of session. She plucked a leaf or two from the plant in the corner. It had a sharp, green smell when she crushed the leaf between her fingers.

\"You do that every session. Why?\" Hazey asked.

Hei[']{dir="rtl"}d interrupted her in the act of taking the acridness into her lungs. In fact, she was sending the smell up to mom, dad, and Gabe like smoke signals. ["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}m just\... cleaning up your plant."

Dr. Hazey tented his fingers. "One leaf a day barely keeps up with what it drops."

When she crushed the leaf between her fingers, it released a pungent smell. She brought it up to her nose and offered this message of life somewhere to the ozone. She[']{dir="rtl"}d read that smell was the most ancient of the human senses. Maybe it was magic and reached farther than anybody knew.

["]{dir="rtl"}it looks like a ritual. What is it? You[']{dir="rtl"}re bored so let[']{dir="rtl"}s talk about something new."

Dr. Hazey was half crazy. Her problem was she never knew. which one would show up in session. Her bad luck to get the sane one today. She hadn\'t slept at all last night. Always the dreams. She was too tired to think of a misdirection. Making up a lie was too much work when she was braindead, dragging a bag of bones around with her all day. Fuck it.

\"I like to smell things and offer them up.\"

\"To who? Your family?\"

She shrugged, like who else was there to talk to but her dad?

Hayes went to the plant, broke off a leaf, increased it with his thumbnail. \",\" He said. \"It releases its oils when you break the skin. It smells peppery. Sharp.

She nodded. \"What is it?\"

Double fuck it. \"I smell things for them. Because they can\'t smell for themselves. It\'s kind of a reminder of what they\'re missing.\"

OG owned a T-shirt from the Pike Place Market that read, *I talk to dead people*. Aunt Peggy wanted to buy some fresh salmon to cook for dinner sometime during the week following the accident when all old girl could do or stumble blind behind her. It was the first thing she had shown an interest in and Peggy bought it for her on the spot

\"Don\'t you have a shirt that says something like that?\"

\"So you smell things for them and talk to them. What else do you do to keep your family close?\" Most of the time her psychiatrist looked half asleep, eyes at half mast, especially on days when the skunk smell of weed mangled with his aftershave. In last night[']{dir="rtl"}s dream, the dog screamed. The high-pitched howl catapulted her out of sleep as if she[']{dir="rtl"}d been sleeping in the car with them. \"Sometimes they\'re too alive,\" she muttered. At night, she either couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t sleep or if she did, she would wake up, thinking she was riding in the car with them, but it turn out they were already gone. ["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}ve got this phrase that keeps repeating in my head. It keeps saying, T*hey\'re gone, they\'re gone. They\'re never coming back*. I hear it 70 times an hour every day. Then it wakes me in the night and it tells me what I don\'t want to know.\"

Hey, she said, \"you can talk to them all you want. Part of the task of brief is to figure out how to bring your dead into you where they will be with you forever.\" He followed up this crazy state with one even more insane.\"There\'s a study from Great Britain that says something like 70% of widows who lost their husbands talk to them every day.\" Her doctor[']{dir="rtl"}s eyes were drooping and tired, like he hasn\'t slept either, but he seemed particularly sane that day. Maybe the skunk smell was woven into the fibers of his tweed jacket like a second skin.

It could\'ve been her tiredness. Some desperate craving for relief. Or maybe it was the fact that Hayes didn\'t seem to be surprised for it by her ongoing conversations with people who were dead and buried more than three years ago. She accepted it without question when he said, \"you\'ve got PTSD. EMDR can help you.\"

The term EMDR translated in retired mind as \"I\'m a doctor.\"

Eye Movement Desensitization and Re-processing wasn\'t like any normal western medicine she\'d experienced. The process he led her through was strange, very woo-woo and so simple. All she did was follow the doctor[']{dir="rtl"}s index finger with her eyes as it moved from side to side while they talked about the train crash. Later, when she replayed it in her mind, it seemed ridiculous.

Except it wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t.

If matter was neither created nor destroyed, one of the few things she remembered from AP chemistry, then why couldn\'t other parts of existence be passed back-and-forth between the living and the dead?

She had to look it up in the old cyclopedia of Britannica or what past is inner horizons library. God forbid that the program would provide access to Google for the psychiatrically disturbed. It was called the law of conservation of mass. For some reason, it gave her comfort to know that Gabe, who in her mind still smelled of baby powder, wasn\'t burned up in tiny pieces of ash and smoke I\'m getting hot with the problem is no but had just been transformed into something new and ephemeral like stardust.

It seemed like every time she came into session deathly tired, it was like times stood still. If she let down her guard, just a little, crafty Dr. Hayes, who looked like he was fairly awake would see some door opening and wedge it wider when she was too tired to defend herself. You never know what stumble is going to make you pick yourself up again and move on.

You-Da-Hoe Jacket Flap copy

Hartwig

A group of teenagers on the cusp of adulthood are locked up together at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho. Their incarceration is supposed to transform them from crazy to sane but nobody seems to realize that the doctor who runs things is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there while a real psychopath stalks the treatment center in a garbage truck.

Told in alternating voices, You-Da-Hoe asks the reader to decide what and who is really crazy when life is filled with unavoidable loss. At the emotional center of the story is a parentless 17-year-old called Old Girl who must choose between killing herself and living to tell the tale of how she survives adolescence to make it to adulthood.

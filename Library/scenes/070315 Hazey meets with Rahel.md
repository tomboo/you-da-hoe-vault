070315 Hazey meets with Rahel

His job was to assure Rahel about Lydia's progress which wasn't very reassuring. Seven write-ups, all for sexual misconduct. She was the one who had gotten an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman, fired.

He read through Lydia's file with the carefully worded reports with code phrases. "Good at articulating her point-of-view" (obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessoning (keeping her under locked up and away from temptation was working). "Recommend single room" (can't get along with a roommate)

What he could say definitively say about Lydia Bronfman was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were always on time.

Maybe he needed the damn muscle relaxant. It would loosen his tongue re Lydia.

Parents came to Dr Hazey to be reassured. He'd tried passing off this duty to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene had a problem with brutal honesty. She had no idea how to be reassuring. When parents met with Darlene, she of the dour and untrusting personality, there went another monthly fee transferred away to the new Anorexia Unit at McLain or Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu. It was a dog-eat-dog-with-anxieties-world. Hazey had mastered the trick of hitting the right balance between avuncular reassurement and eschewing the red flag of hopeless. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact almost all adolescents' predilection to sit down in the middle of the road and refuse to grow up. Until they did.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January. She just wasn't any better.

Rahel Bronfman nee -- whatever, was a petite, dark-haired woman. A perfect clone of her daughter or, he supposed, the other way around. Lydia was also tiny but rounded in that childlike way while her mother was tight and lean without an ounce of softness. Calves like knots rose above excellent chiseled ankles, her hips the size of a girl's. Clearly, she followed a workout routine than was more military than the Marines.

Her biggest concern was whether Lydia was gaining any weight. "She has a tendency to fat, like I do," Mrs. Bronfman said, patting at a haunch that was as flat and stringy as a coyote. It was not hard to see where Lydia got her obsession with food.

She really was attractive in a feral, hungry way. When she laid a hand on his arm---he'd made the mistake of sitting next to her on the couch---he felt like a cream puff awaiting her sharp teeth. "Help my little girl," she was saying. "Lydia's all I have."

He made an attempt at probing gently about why Rahel had been absent during Lydia's weekly family therapy calls. She said airily, "I've been out of the country" as if phones and Skype hadn't been invented.

"Kids feel abandoned if a parent isn't a participant in their therapy," he said.

"My father is Benjamin Bronfman," she said. "He's the father figure in Lydia's life. He never misses a call."

Hazey took the hint and smoothly deflected the issue of whether Rahel was a good mother. Of course, it was the key issue between the mother and daughter and he wasn't going to solve the issue of a lifetime in 45-minute conversation.

"It's great you're here. Lydia is so happy," he said. "Just don't be surprised if she acts out."

"Of course," Rahel murmured, patting his hand again as if she was measuring a piece of meat she wanted to snap up. He wondered if Alma still felt married. He definitely did even though he didn't think she was coming back. How thin the line between love and hate.

Thank the lucky stars that Darlene had been able to convince Lydia to meet with Rahel, even though it had taken a marathon of extra therapy sessions and arcane negotiations that involved bribery because Lydia wanted to take classes at NICC, though she was nowhere near being ready for that amount of freedom.

The clack of Rahel's tiny spike heels as she walked away sounded like a jackhammer in Hazey's overloaded brain. His neck felt like someone had seized his head and wrenched it around backwards. God, he needed that muscle relaxant. He absolutely couldn't indulge. There was no way he could be able to maintain during Old Girl's session. It was only an hour he had to wait. He could control himself.

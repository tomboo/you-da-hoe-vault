Dear Gail Hochman

Brandt & Hochman Literary Agents, Inc.

Dear Gail,

Thirteen years ago, when Poets & Writers profiled you as Bob Shacochi's best and most loyal advocate, I told myself I wanted to work with you. It only took me that long to write a story good enough to submit to you. Learning to tell a good story takes a long time.

ALT 1 NOVEL PITCH

Who What How Crazy? tells the story of five teenagers on the cusp of adulthood who are locked up together at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho. Their treatment is supposed to transform them from crazy to sane but nobody seems to realize that the doctor who runs the program is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there while a real psychopath stalks the center in a garbage truck.

Told in alternating voices, this novel asks the reader to decide what is really crazy behavior in the lives of adolescents who have experienced unavoidable tragedy and loss. At the emotional center of the story is a parentless 17-year-old called Old Girl who must choose between killing herself and living to tell the tale.

ALT 2 NOVEL PITCH

What if you were such a screw up, you kept screwing up your own suicide so your guardians dumped you in backwoods Idaho with a bunch of other screw-ups to help you get sane? My novel You-Da-Hoe explores of the thin line between craziness and immaturity five troubled adolescents battle the temptations of alcohol, drugs, sex and doing whatever the hell you want while locked up at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment center in rural Idaho.

The only problem is that nobody seems to notice that the doctor who runs the Program is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there and a psychopath stalks the treatment center in a garbage truck.

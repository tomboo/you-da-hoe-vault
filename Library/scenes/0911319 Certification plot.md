0911319 Certification plot

On top of everything else, Hazey turned the routine at Healing House into a goat rodeo in order to get ready for the Certification Board visit.

It made no odds to Margaret if Dr. Hazey wanted to revive his application to expand Inner Horizons to Outer Mongolia. In fact, it was preferable if it meant that Gretchen could go off and manage the new facility while Margaret took over her own well-run fiefdom at Healing House where she planned to deep-six Gretchen's rules and insert her own.

For once Margaret was in favor of paying big time for the shiny shoes and silk ties of Hazey's fancy lawyer. His name was Cohen, which just goes to show you that President Trump wasn't the only nimnoe to buy off his persecutors with graft. This lawyer was Jedadiah Cohe, a shoe-string connection to the Jewish Cohens of the Bronx.

Whatever.

Once a Cohen, always a Cohen. Identifiable with a flexible attitude toward greasing palms or earmarking a large donation to Dr. Evensong's research at the University of Washington.

Margaret excused herself after a few minutes of chitchat with Chase. He said he had to go to the bathroom and she took the opportunity to go blast a few rounds at the raccoons before the Review Board visit. Hazey would kill her if they made an unscheduled appearance.

Hazey had warned everybody with dire imprecations to make the place spic-and-span with no fuck-ups by the time he arrived at Healing House for the dog and pony show of the "perfect" treatment facility.

CHASE'S POV

"Shit on an oyster!" the large woman cried inexplicably. "Those damned critters."

She peered out the window at something Chase couldn't see. Distractedly, she said, "Would you excuse me? I've got something to attend to."

Chase took the opportunity to go to the bathroom like a reprieve from heaven. "Happy to wait," he said like a model patient.

"It'll just take a sec." She was already rooting in the hall closet and Chase barely heard her say something about raccoons as he rushed to the powder room next to the kitchen. She'll think I have a bad case of diarrhea, he thought, and that'll buy more time.

Raccoons? He must have misheard her say 'macaroons.' Good, he'd be hungry for a sugar after ingesting what was tucked under the sole of his shoe.

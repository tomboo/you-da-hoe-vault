OLD GIRL WANTED TO KILL HERSELF in the worst way. Well, scratch that. She wanted to kill herself in the most appealing, least painful way, which was not that easy when all you had to draw upon were the life experiences of Hello Kitty.

Nine young adults --- "YAs" as the staff at Inner Horizons called residents 17- to 20-years old --- draggled into the Healing House living room for Process Group. They were trying not to look like they were hurrying to get seated by 9 AM. Three couches were shoved together in the usual off-kilter circle.

Darlene rapped on the meditation gong. Inner Horizons Therapeutic, Holistic and Wellness Center for Troubled Teens in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, had recently promoted her to Head Therapist. She was usually too high up in the food chain to lead Process Group but today, because Axel Friedman had been fired, she was subbing.

The gong set off a flurry of pushing and shoving to get a seat on the couch with the black and brown blots called the Rorschach Couch. Nobody wanted to get stuck on the Jizz Couch, not since Lydia Bronfmann had been caught banging Axel, her therapist, on it.

Dani Cohen tossed a hip-check at Lydia. She flopped into place before Lydia could get there first. Lydia mouthed "Eat me" at Dani, then she stretched out full length on the plaid Jizz Couch, taking the whole thing for herself. Why should Lydia care about sitting on the wet spot when the bodily fluids were some of her own?

Welcome to the twice-weekly bitch fest known as Process Group.

Old Girl scooted her ottoman away from the group. She faced the picture window looking out on a curtain of gray snow. It had started snowing last October and was going to keep on snowing until May.

Darlene sighed. "Demerit card to Dani, one to Lydia. See me after Process for paperwork." Then, without a pause, she launched into a lengthy introduction of the new black girl like a cheer leader. "Meet the newest member of the Inner Horizons team! Rachel Cathcart! Yay!"

Last week, a tall willowy black girl had been frog-marched into Healing House by two ex-cops in matching ski jackets and baseball caps that said T*rust in God, Buy a Gun*. If your parents brought you to treatment \-- or in Old Girl\'s case, your guardians, Uncle David and Aunt Peggy --- it meant you were poor. If you arrived by escort, your parents paid a bundle to fly you to Idaho under personal guard so you couldn\'t run.

Rachel, the newbie, slumped next to James Olson on the Rorschach couch. She might have been fifteen or forty with eggplant-colored skin and dark eyes that looked hollow with fatigue. Her tee shirt read "Give Up the Ghost." Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, catching a glimpse of a wrist with horizontal scars. Like herself and most of the girls in the program. If the scars had been vertical, she wouldn\'t be here.

Get prepared, newbie. Heads are going to turn when you walk down a street in lily-white Coeur d\'Alene where the Aryan Nations headquarters is close enough to throw a rock at you. Get used to your nappy hair because they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife close enough to hurt you will be in the hands of a skinny cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Now the daily argument about who had to process first. Old Girl contemplated a three-foot long icicle spear hanging from the eaves. It had started forming several weeks ago. Now it was the longest fang in a mouthful of jagged teeth that framed the Ponderosa-ringed yard. If the icicle gave way, would it knock her brains out or impale her?

Old Girl was eleven when she first tried to kill herself. She raided the medicine cabinet at Uncle David\'s and Aunt Peggy\'s house in Naperville, Illinois. The problem was that her guardians were health nuts. Every multivitamin and mineral in the universe along with jumbo size bottles of Sam-E extract and glucosamine-chondroitin and chia seeds and flax seeds and fish oil jammed the shelves. Ex-Lax was the only thing that had a "Keep Away from Children" warning. How was she supposed to know that shitting yourself to death was the world's worst way to go?

At 17, after two years in Adolescents, Old Girl applied strict rules to the list of acceptable ways to off herself. Nothing gross, for example. Ditto, no vomiting. After the ignominy of being towed out of Lake Minnetonka by an Eagle Scout camp counselor ---picture three cracked ribs from chest compressions and lake water expelled so forcefully it burst a blood vessel in one eye \-- now, all fluids were verboten. Double-ditto efforts that involved road rash, like the kind she got when she fell out of Uncle David's Buick on the way home from middle school. She let her body weight carry her out the unlatched door and learned a good lesson in physics about objects in motion. It wasn't worth all the handwringing and recriminations, not to mention a broken femur and the harrowing experience of having gravel hand-picked out of her cheek bone with forceps.

Now that she was older, her urges to kill herself came upon her at moments when she least expected them. She wondered at times if her brain was being rewired while she in the middle of using it. The last time it happened, she remembered thinking it was time to buy a new head for her electric toothbrush. The next thing she knew, she found herself sticking a fork in the outlet to see if she could fry.

All she could think in those moments, the only drumbeat in her head, was \"make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\" If the pain wouldn\'t stop, she had no choice but to open the car door and let gravity take over. On days, like today, when the drumbeat to die, die, die, receded to an I, I, I, of dull pain, she finished her homework and did her chores at Healing House and went to therapy three times with Dr. Hazey, the founder of Inner Horizons. He talked to Old Girl all the time about ways to combat the urge to hoodwink herself out of daylight into perpetual night.

So far, no success.

Lydia Bronfmann lost the argument about who had to introduce themselves with an accountability list so that the newbie could see how everyone at Inner Horizons was taking responsibility for their actions. Lydia was a cutter. She was also a nympho. And a bulimic. And the only child from the Bronfmann beer-making family in Michigan. You could hear the Detroit in the list of behaviors she was sing-singing through which started with fucking Axel Friedman. Everybody was mad at Lydia because Axel was the best pitcher on the Inner Horizons soft ball team.

Lucky Axel.

This wasn't like school where they got rid of the troublemakers by expulsion. No way would Inner Horizons give up Lydia's heinous fees. Why Lydia was apologizing was a mystery. None of her peers gave a shit who Lydia fucked. She had sex with everybody so it would have been like counting her family's bottles of beer on the wall. Only Big Paul, the Aspergery math wizard who sat by himself on the loveseat, could count that high.

Lydia seemed to be channeling Marilyn Monroe's breathy voice while she listed behaviors that included blowing and sucking and corn holing. "Axel pushed my hand away when I touched his zipper," she was saying. "He said it wasn't appropriate but that's not what his woody had to say."

Darlene rapped a pen on the clipboard. "Skip the crap, Lydia. Tell us what you're taking ownership of."

"How can I take ownership if I don't tell you what I did?" Lydia blinked blue, ingenuous eyes accented by diamond earrings the size of dimes.

"Keep it moving."

"Well, he was moaning... you know? But in a good way...."

Lydia was trying to outdo Dani Cohen, her nemesis. Dani earned a living as a nude dancer to spite her parents who were born-again Christians. The two of them were so self-involved, so clueless about anything else that mattered, Old Girl wanted to choke them with the same rope. The problem was there was no rope at Inner Horizons. No rope, no long scarves, no ties for bathrobes, no leather to hold up a pair of pants (the boys whined about this incessantly). Nothing longer than a shoe lace and even those were kept under lock and key.

Old Girl looked down at her lumpy bumpy laces tied numerous times. She pushed down a rising tide of captive rage. Captive rage was like captor rage, except more vicious. When you had captor rage, there was some dim glimmer of understanding that Charlene, the Night Duty, or Margaret, the Day Supervisor, or Bruce, the Rec Leader, was making eight bucks an hour and didn\'t want to be at Inner Horizons any more than you did. But with captive rage, all that blame was aimed at yourself.

Lydia introduced Old Girl to her first day of captive rage with the phrase, \"Welcome to Youdaho."

Udahoe? Old Girl was so stupid then.

\"No, You-Da-HO.\" Lydia put the emphasis on the last syllable. \"You da crazy fucked up ho who fucked up by getting yourself locked up in bum-fuck Idaho with a bunch of crazy fucks you\'ll never get away from.\"

Even at fifteen, she thought the joke was a lame but the stupid name stuck and people used it every day until it was an ear worm that couldn\'t be shaken.

Now Lydia was telling about how she\'d gotten over on a police officer with a blowjob. Her short black curls bobbed enthusiastically on a childishly thin neck. "Too bad it didn't work with his partner."

Darlene made a note. Flipped briskly to a clean page on the clipboard. "It's obvious you're not really ready to take responsibility for your actions, Lydia. You and I will revisit your Accountability Letter in session."

So Darlene had inherited Lydia in the therapist's shake up after Axel\'s departure.

Old Girl was secretly glad she hadn't had to switch therapists when she moved from Ads to YAs in early January. Dr. Hazey, the vague and disorganized head of Inner Horizons, had been her therapist from D-Day (shortened from Despair Day: April 15, 2015). A Yale degree in psychiatry framed on Hazey's office wall said he graduated in 1986 "with distinction in Youth and Adolescent Behavioral Psychiatry.\" That meant Hazey had to be what... almost fifty? No wonder he was practically senile.

James Olson, the lanky blond surfer from Malibu, was now talking in a low monotone to the floor. He'd gotten caught with a bag of Jelly Bellies and a Milky Way in his backpack, which was small potatoes compared to the real reason he was in the Program. He'd crashed his birthday Porsche stoned on weed or poppers---"basically out of his mind" he'd admitted in one of those tense, shamefests that made you want to run away from Process Group and climb in bed and never get get up.

"I traded my Revos for the candy," said James.

Then Darlene wanted to know how he could afford Jelly Bellies on \$5-a-week snack allowance.

That was how the economy worked at Inner Horizons. A \$300 pair of sunglasses bought you \$5 worth of sugar high. Darlene tried to get him to rat out the person he traded with.

"Somebody from NICC."

Smooth, James. Old Girl knew for a fact that Reza, his roommate and a meth-addicted motor-mouth, had supplied the candy because Reza's New York Jets cap had the Revos hanging off the back. Smart move on James part to put the blame on somebody at Northern Idaho Community College. After three months without running, YAs had the \"privilege\" of taking 10 credits a quarter "under close supervision." If James had really sold the Revos at NICC, he would have gotten at least a hundred bucks on the trade. All James had to do was tell Mommy or Daddy on his weekly Family Call that he lost his sunglasses and they'd FedEx him another pair. Ching-ching-ching. A galaxy of Milky Ways would show up in the stash under his mattress.

Out of the corner of Old Girl's eye, a drip beaded and rolled down the icicle. It hung at the tip as if time in Idaho had the unique ability to stretch to its farthest dimensions.

At Inner Horizons, you were stuck in the never ending present with no ability to go forward and an 80% chance that you were going to go backwards if you screwed up. If you earned a demerit, say, for being late to Process Group or failed to take the trash out or you fell into a depression and couldn't get out of bed or you refused to participate in some stupid tell-the-truth game during therapy, the clock would turn around and run backward and taunt you as it ran. Old Girl had had the bitter experience of looking forward to a weeklong trip home to visit Aunt Peggy and Uncle David. Just when she was close to getting sprung, the crazy clock rewound and she found herself \"unsafe without supervision\" and stayed trapped in Idaho ever since.

The wall thermometer outside read 28 degrees. At breakfast, it was 23 degrees. Yippee! Idaho's definition of spring.

During clean-up, she'd overheard Margaret O'Leary, the one Day Supervisor she liked, yelling out the front door to the fix-it guy to get off his lazy ass and knock the icicles off the eaves before they killed somebody.

It hadn't occurred to Old Girl that you could simply stand under some hanging ice and let it put you out of your misery.

How would you know when an icicle was ready to drop? The insistence in Margaret's voice made the timing seem imminent. "The temperature is rising," she'd told the trash man who seemed to pick up trash whenever he felt like it. He stunk and he drove a rackety ancient truck stacked with double rows of barrels that smelled just as bad. Maybe melting was the key. The icicle dripped moisture during the day when it warmed up, then refroze at night.

Thinking about gravity and physics gave Old Girl a headache---it was where she always got into trouble in her suicide tries ---so she switched to imagining what she would look like laid out in the snow like a fallen angel.

Instead of the gothic and practical dreads she'd been growing since Aunt Peggy and Uncle David left her in Idaho with vague admonitions to "get well," Old Girl would let her straight copper hair fan out like a sun storm in a corona around her head. She had Dad's blight of freckles but the felting and matting process of dreads had squeezed the color out of her hair. Now it looked dull as cardboard. Lack of blood would lighten her freckles; she supposed. Would it also flatten out the bump in her nose?

Old Girl was so tired. She had a hard time sleeping because her mind kept fabricating scenes of her death. She liked scenarios that were as plot driven as mysteries. The devil was in the details. Jimmy Choo shoes. Miu-Miu dresses. Weather might be dark and creep-meister or gray as grainy film noir or occasionally, like that poem she liked about Icarus falling into the sea, she imagined a fishing boat that steamed on oblivious to a body dropping out of the sky. Tragedy didn't always have to slap you in the face.

"Old Girl, wake up!" The edge in Darlene's voice cut into her daydream. For a moment, it sounded like Mom calling her out of the pages of a book to come and set the table.

"Bring your ottoman back in the circle," Darlene said.

Old Girl didn\'t want to come back in the circle. She absolutely, categorically, unequivocally wanted to be left alone. The day Aunt Peggy and Uncle David dumped her off, she'd renamed herself Old Girl. If she could be thrust in the middle of some alternate existence, this new existence could at least bestow on her a new identity. Why couldn't she be Old Girl when everything that made her a child had been ripped away?

"We're waiting?"

The pleasures of double homicide-suicide flitted through her head as she swiveled dutifully back to the fringes of the group.

Old Girl blinked. The droplet was gone as if it had never existed. That's how she liked to think of her own death. Moving from some place where you were stuck to a new, shiny state of existence where mothers and fathers and baby brothers didn't die at the mercy of a geriatric senior citizen who couldn't tell the gas pedal from the brake.

By the time Lydia, James, Dani and Big Paul processed their accountable behaviors, they had covered cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex and incest, shoplifting, theft, assault and battery, sibling torture, road rage, indecent exposure, arson, and vandalism . If it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it.

When it was it newbie Rachel's turn. Darlene urged her to share something meaningful with the group. Inner Horizons was big on sharing. "Tell us about you," Darlene said. "What behaviors would you like to own up to?"

Old Girl felt for the newbie who glanced outside, then up at the ceiling, as if she was looking for some escape. She wondered if Rachel's cutting had aged her as much as Old Girl's had aged her.

Rachel hunched her shoulders as if she was trying to make herself smaller. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills.

The girl stood up, as she was going to address the group, but instead, she toppled backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

Darlene vaulted from her chair. "Get Bruce!" Pointing at Lydia, she shouted, "Call 9-1-1!"

By then, Rachel was jerking and convulsing like a puppet. Her head knocked the floor and her legs kicked and flailed.

Old Girl found herself at Rachel's side gripping her by her ears. She held tight trying to stop the horrible sound of skull cracking hard wood. James Olson knelt opposite her, His white-knuckled hands pressed down on her shins.

Could James feel the new girl\'s bolt of electricity like she could? When she laid hands on her, she could feel the electricity coursing through the wire that was Rachel's body. The jolting and sparking was deeply unnerving. It made Old Girl want to run at the same time that her hands were stapled to Rachel\'s body.

Jesus, she was thinking. Get me out of here!

From the stricken look in James' blue eyes, she understood that he was feeling the same shock and awe and horror.

Fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck. How can I hold this girl to the earth when I can barely hold onto myself ?

Until that instant, running away from Inner Horizons had always been in Old Girl\'s mind as an fuzzy possibility. Like every other resident, she hated and loathed the Program and woke up every morning believing she couldn\'t stand one more day. For once, the constant psychobabble about self- actualization and self-denial and self-development and self-knowledge and self education and self-preservation made her acutely aware that the only way to save her sorry self was to run.

No more shilly-shallying. Run tonight.

Shilly-shallying\--where had that come from? Shilly-shallying was something her mother would have said if she wasn\'t now a greasy spot on the railroad tracks with Dad and baby Gabe after being shoved into a train by a geriatric driver who slammed into them from the rear. No shilly-shallying there. Nothing left but gristle and bone when it came time to bury them, according to a matter-of-fact Aunt Peggy who conveyed this nugget of information on the phone to her best friend the day after it happened when she thought Old Girl was out cold with a sedative on the couch.

Now her attention was back on Rachel\'s surprisingly firm neck. The dark backs of her hands with palms as pink as rabbit ears thumped the floor while her heels beat their own crazy tattoo.

Shilly-shallying is done . Go now.

By the time the fit finally stopped, Darlene and Bruce, the driver, scurried around with Margaret directing traffic until they got Rachel's limp body loaded into the van. Darlene decided they should drive her to the emergency room at Kootenai General which was faster than waiting for an ambulance to drive out 15 miles to Healing House, then drive another 15 miles back to the hospital.

In all the hustle and hoo-ha getting out the door, Darlene forgot her purse.

Old Girl spotted it next to the wingback chair where Darlene had been sitting at Process Group. She reached to grab it but Lydia scooped up the bag first.

The little shit!

In the top was a wallet. A twenty peeked a green corner out like a promise. Old Girl watched ruefully as Lydia plucked the twenty and palmed it in one smooth motion while calling out loudly, \"Darlene! Your purse!\"

Damn that Lydia. Always a step ahead when it came to herself. Old Girl could have used the money to add to the minuscule stash of cash she had painstakingly amassed by over months. She got \$25 for selling her North Face jacket worth \$250 bucksto an Indian girl who looked like she needed it more than Old Girl did. How \$36. 58 was going to get her to Seattle, she had no idea.

Darlene took the bag, thanking Lydia profusely. Lydia smiled sweetly, flashing Old Girl a middle finger behind her back. She moved past James, bumped him on the ass, then slid into the bathroom off the kitchen.

Old Girl sighed. Another sexcapade in the making. Did James and Lydia think people were blind to their hook-ups? Apparently.

OG Opening rewrites

> 112818 OG Rules of Road New Opening
>
> Today was unusual because Darlene had tantalized them with the promise of a hike after Process Group "if they were good" i.e. blew their noses and made their beds and didn't break out in a Tourett's fit of swearing (Reza) or pull a room- mate's hair (Dani) or start a fire (Big Paul), they would hike on snow shoes to Two Mouth Lake. Two Outdoor Recreation outings in a row. It was unheard of. It was also Martin Luther King Day, a three-day holiday after three weeks of staring at each other locked inside four walls while snow came down in curtains day after day.
>
> Their Sisyphean task was to roll the horrible weighted ball of normal behavior up a steep, interminable slope and when you got to the top, shaken and weary and sobbing with effort, you were supposed to let the iron weight roll over you on its way down the hill. No one made it through Intensive in the brochure's wildly optimistic three months. If you were lucky (OG wasn't), you made it up to the brink and the ball rolled back over you like a Caterpillar steam roller two or three times before you were allowed to move ahead into Community Re-Introduction, where the same climb up to the brink and the roll back to the bottom to try again would rinse and repeat till the Program had wrung all your family's money out of them.
>
> OG knew this from painful personal experience. She'd just found an invoice on the Xerox machine which was made out to Uncle David and Aunt Peggy, her guardians. It was the third invoice printed with a big red LATE notice on the bill.
>
> Nobody in the room wanted to risk getting a one today of all days. The Program, in its glossy four-color brochures that OG had seen in Dr. Hazey's office, touted a philosophy of teaching the Four Quadrants of Daily Living. If you behaved---at your inedible spinach, made your bed, said please and thank you, didn't stab a tablemate with a fork, you were graded on your best behavior with threes or fours. If you pulled a peer's hair (Dani), failed to get out of bed repeatedly (OG), stole from your roommate (Reza), got caught with cigarettes (Dani), weed (James), palming your meds and selling them (everyone), you got handed a two if you were lucky, and a one if you were not. Enough ones in the Four Quadrants of I, you, we, and they, and you were denied privileges. Today's Outdoor Recreation hike, after three solid weeks of snow kept them staring at each other inside four walls was a privilege no one wanted to loose. But the real damage of consistent ones in all the quadrants was that any progress through the arcane stages of Inner Horizon would be erased.
>
> Theoretically when you arrived from whatever fuck up that got you sent to the most fucked up psychiatric treatment facility in the country, you were supposed to spend three months in the fucked up gulag called Intensive. Intensive was where the noose was the tightest. Five times a week of intensive therapy, two intensive process groups per week and no extracurricular activities as mundane as a walk around the block. Who wouldn't be a raving maniac without an intensive hair shirt?
>
> When you were finally moved to Community Re-Introduction, they knocked back therapy to three times a week and kept up Process Group twice a week, then big whoop, gave you the "opportunity" to take one or two classes at Northern Idaho Community College (NICC), if you were college bound, or you could work fifteen hours a week of "community service" which might involve bagging potatoes at the Food Pantry or sorting dirty underwear at the Povarello Center, the Idaho version of Good Will. Shining far out in the distance of the Inner Horizon brochure was the paradise of Transition, where well and happy clients lived in a grown-up apartment, were given a real key for the door, and you either went to school or worked at a job with minimal supervision but were till tethered to Inner Horizon's astronomical fees by bi-weekly therapy sessions.
>
> No one in this room had ever been in Transition. OG had known a girl a long time ago who got there but then she'd run and no more was heard about her till the night she came back 15 pounds lighter and shaking and she was shuttled off to the gulag called Stabilization which a gulag of a different order with hospital beds and nurses and cataleptic drugs so calming you forgot who you were supposed to be.

NEW version of opening

> Her given name was Vivian Gormly but after her parents died, she always introduced herself as Vivian Lifeless. Somehow this idea, when mingled with her very real desire to die, made her start thinking of herself as old and decrepit, i.e. ready to die, so when she arrived at the Program, she insisted, with a 16-year-old's flair for drama and histrionics, that everyone call her Old Girl. After a few weeks, it took too much boring explanation to tell every new kid who came into treatment the history of Old Girl as a name, in the lazy way of all nicknames, Old Girl devolved into OG, and now no one -- herself included -- remembered that she used to have a real name, not an acronym.
>
> "What's it stand for?" Rachel, her new roommate, asked when she met her.
>
> "OG," she said.
>
> "No, really."
>
> Here we go again. "Old Goat," she said, reluctantly.
>
> "Old Gonad is better," said Reza.
>
> "Old Groupie?" Rachel said.
>
> "What about Old Gormless? Reza who'd come into the program the same time she had, suggested.
>
> "What the hell is a Gorm?" Rachel asked.
>
> "Gorm is my last name." OG left off the "ly" to shut off the pointless and boring discussion. It could be reasoned, Godless, gormless but not goddamn harmless.
>
> Angela and Gabriel, two gifts from God, her mother, a devout Catholic, liked to say. If they were all gifts from God, why had he taken three of them away and left one behind to suffer? That was the question OG had asked the priest at their funeral. His answer was some horse shit about God and his mysterious ways. That's when OG realized that God was just another way to say "I don't know."
>
> Inner Horizons had an arcane demerit system based on the Four Quadrants of Daily Living, basically a bunch of crap that any sleepover camp would call The Rules. If you behaved---ate your overcooked spinach, made your bed, refrained from spitting on your housemates, said at least two innocuous things at Process Group, didn't sit like a lump of coal outside the circle of chairs as OG was doing today---your good behavior would earn you a three or four in Daily Living. If you went off on your therapist (Estie) or pulled someone's hair (Dani) or wouldn't get out of bed (Big Paul), you earned a one. Personally, OG didn't give a shit -- nor did anyone else who lived at Healing House---if she got ones. Today, though, a one meant no Outdoor Recreation. They'd been cooped up inside for three weeks because that's how long it had been snowing in great white curtains. If she didn't get outside, OG was going to shift her focus from killing herself and apply her considerable intellect to killing everyone around her, starting with Head Therapist, Darlene.

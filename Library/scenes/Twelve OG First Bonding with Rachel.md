TWELVE

YOU LEAKED OUT FEELINGS AND pain at your peril at Inner Horizons. Therapists used Old Girl's leakings in devious ways; her first therapist, who\'d left the program in three months because she hated Crazy Hazey and needed to make a living wage, had been unrelenting in her quest to get Old Girl to \"open up.\" You\'re only hurting yourself, Rosa liked to say. No man is an island.

"No woman no cry," Old Girl answered.

Rosa laughed when Old Girl rolled her eyes at her cliché's, and then she'd would spin out more homilies for fun. \"The truth will set you free.\" \"Open your heart and let me in.\" \"Honesty is the best policy.\" "The heart is a lonely hunter."

Bull shit. If you got close to anybody, they either ratted you out or they left. Rosa, whom she\'d secretly admired, had escaped to Seattle, hadn\'t she? Now Old Girl was stuck with Dr. Hazey for a therapist.

Her new roommate huddled in her bed with the blankets over her head, pretending to sleep. Every few minutes her hand would snake out from the sheets and she'd grope around the bedside table for more Kleenex. So far, Old Girl counted four Kleenex forays.

Old Girl finally addressed the lump under the covers. \"Pretty soon you\'re going to be buried in snot rags." No reaction. After a pause, Rachel sat up setting off a cascade of Kleenex balls and she switched on her lamp. Old Girl had been writing a list of stuff she needed, lighting up her notes with her headlamp. The bed lamp revealed Rachel\'s soggy, tearful face. She pretended to be busy rooting around in the bed for the Kleenex blobs and she dumped them one by one in Old Girl\'s Hello Kitty garbage can they were sharing.

\"Rough day?\" Old Girl asked? \"Or are you saving your boogers?\"

Rachel smiled a wobbly, sad sackish smile. \"You must be used to it by now.\"

\"Used to baring your soul and letting people eat it like pate?\" Old Girl inspected her longest dreadlock crossing her eyes to focus on the nicely thickening rat. \"You sort of get used to it.\"

\"Are you used to it?\"

Oh fuck. Old Girl wanted to run out of the room. Not a good time to reach out and touch someone, she muttered, half under her breath. She faux-casually switched off her headlamp and hoped Rachel would get the message that their nascent slumber party was over before it started.

Rachel said, \"Reach out and touch someone. Is that a song?\"

\"No, an ad campaign. My mom used to sing the jingle.\"

\"My mom died last year,\" Rachel said.

Oh double fuck and fuck a duck, Old Girl thought. Now what? She considered telling Rachel that she had no mom either but decided against it. Why seem like she was receptive to sharing when she wasn't? \"I killed mine,\" Old Girl said.

\"What? With your jokes?\"

Old Girl choked, biting back a laugh. "You're quick,\" she said. "A smart ass."

The two girls, one red eyed and sniffling, the other closed up as a clam, sized each other with appreciation.

\"My mother really is dead,\" Old girl finally said, feeling something like a hair-like crack in her stony, and heart when her words went out of her own dark and dreary corner to the light that was shining on Rachel\'s face.

"Mine isn't. I just wish she was."

Old Girl\'s heart flexed a tiny bit in Rachel\'s direction. It was a rare experience at Healing House when someone surprised her by making her laugh.

\"What do you think of James?\" Rachel asked.

\"He\'s OK. Kind of a jock boy. He's a hog on the treadmill.\"

\"Can you trust him?\"

Whoo boy. That was not a question you can answer without consuming a piece of your own liver.

\"Trust him with what? Your virginity?\"

Rachel laughed. \"No, stupid. He seems nice.\"

Everybody seemed nice until you told them something you cared about and then they used it in Process to eviscerate you.

How long has he been here? Rachel wanted to know.

\"Six months? Seven? He came here from wilderness camp, someplace in Bumfuck, Utah.\"

\"Bumfuck, Utah, to Bumfuck, Idaho. He\'s made progress.\"

\"It\'s not Idaho. It\'s You-Da-Hoe,\" Old Girl said.

\"Udahoe?\"

"You-Da-Hoe for being stupid enough to get locked up here with people just as crazy and fucked up as you are.\"

She could see Rachel thinking for a minute. The girl seemed comfortable with silence, something that made Old Girl warm to her. That was the problem with being stuck in a treatment program. Everybody talked non-stop about their problems and after a few minutes, all you wanted was to make them shut up so you could hear the wind blow.

\"Why do you want to know about James?\"

\"Is he dating Lydia?\"

Old Girl snorted. \"If blow jobs are your idea of dating.\"

Rachel tilted her head in the manner of Rodney Dangerfield, Aunt Peggy's Auber-smart border collie. Rodney was the smartest dog she\'d ever known. You could talk to him and you\'d swear, when he tilted his head in that intelligent way that he was about to answer.

\"She\'s a sex fiend. Nympho. No personal boundaries. She fucks anything that walks. Well, except for Dr. Hazey and nobody knows if he can get it up.\"

Rachel nodded. \"Hazey\'s kind of smarmy. He said he thought I just need some self-actualization.\"

\"Self-actualization.... That\'s when you actually get to develop a self without being locked up and drugged.

\"Is Hazey a stoner? He did my intake session and he kept slurring his words.\"

\"Everybody\'s a stoner around here. Why not Hazey?\"

\"You\'re full of questions,\" Rachel said, wagging a finger at Old Girl.

\"That\'s because I don\'t have any answers.\"

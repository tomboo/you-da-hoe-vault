The Start of Margaret\'s Day of Decision

This is a story about everybody making choices about how to live. The reason Madcklemore intrigues me and seems to be the sound track of my NaNo novel is that he is a boy/man struggling with the same thing.

Carla\'s death has made me turn to an examined life. I\'m exploring a group of characters who all exist on different points of the life continuum. All Hazey wants to do is escape his life. Margaret\'s life is consumed by work but all her business and capacity for work obscure the need to pick the important stuff to change her situation. Is a midpoint scene of Margaret making a choice to move forward needed?

I\'ve got O.G\'s dilemma locked. She\'s the moral center of the kids. Margaret is the moral center of the adults. Margaret has to fight the urge to live as if she\'s dead so that\'s the theme to work with at midpoint. Maybe Margaret's bad day starts at home, them moves into \"This is the moment/There is no encore.\"

The alarm went off like a gunshot and Margaret slapped it to silence. Thank God Lloyd, who\'d tossed and turned and been up and down half the night settled back into a snore. He slept sitting up because his back hurt too much when he laid flat. Mouth open, air whistled in the back of his throat and he looked half dead in his Dilaudid-addled stupor. Margaret couldn\'t remember when he\'d gotten gray. In her mind, her husband went from a laughing nearly constant hard-on to a gray face of pain when he hurt his back.

Pain changed brain chemistry, she remembered the spine doctor telling him when he showed them the x-rays of the narrowing in his spinal column called stenosis.

Margaret put on her packs under her nightgown, wondering if she was going to beat Lloyd to antidepressants.

She kicked her way through snow crust hauling a 5 gallon bucket of water to the trough so the cows could get a drink. They hovered around her dim shape in the dark, smelling of manure and alfalfa that she\'d forked out of the hayrick. \"Hey, boss. Hey boss\" she crooned, her way thru them with another bucket.

She cupped dog food into the bowl with her bare hands. Chip, the border collie, was Lloyd\'s dog and he whined at her knees pushing his nose into her crotch which was as close as Margaret was going to get to being touched there until after Lloyd\'s surgery. \"You're pathetic, she told herself, Enjoying being goosed by a dog.

By the time she left for work, she\'d dry-mopped the kitchen, set out cereal and milk for Floyd\'s breakfast put away the dishes in the rack and turned on the crock pot Hungarian goulash with potatoes she grew in her garden last summer. Lloyd had been able to spoon the clods of dirt so she could pick out the spuds that were sitting on the kitchen counter waiting to be scrubbed. She\'d left them for Floyd, knowing he\'d enjoy helping her with something he could do standing up.

Her eyes felt like sandpaper after her restless night. But there was no way she\'d sleep in the spare bedroom and abandon her husband to his pain. About the only solace they had was hip to hip in the flannel sheets, the sounds of each other\'s breathing in the dark. It was something.

How were they going to pay for surgery? Without Lloyd\'s truck driver income things were tight as it was. They had insurance but it was shitty. A deductible that would choke a horse. Maybe if she could talk Hazey into full time hours they\'d give her benefits. Dental coverage! Vision care! She couldn\'t help laughing at her younger self when all she could think about was getting in the back seat of Lloyd\'s parent;s sedan. How the mighty are fallen over crappy insurance.

She could feel the tension the second she came in the front entry.

Lydia and Charleen were arguing about why Lydia had to interview for her community service hours. \" I shouldn\'t have to work! My family already pays through the nose to keep me here.\"

\"You\'re not working for money,\" Charleen said. \"It\'s about learning responsibility.\"

\"That\'s horse shit,\" Lydia said. \"If you\'re not getting paid why work?\"

Margaret had to agree with the little spoiled rich girl. It was about the money, especially money that paid for healthcare.

\"Put your gloves on,\" she said automatically. \"It\'s cold out.\"

Lydia made a snotty face at Charleen but drew on a fur lined coat. She saw Margaret eyeing it and said \"It\'s mink. Want to feel?\"

Margaret patted the dark silken fur then leaned past her and plucked her old down coat on a hanger. Fur, she thought, who needed fur when you have a low deductible.

Omar bumped into Reza on purpose. He hit the closet door and the handle fell off. Margaret sighed and picked it up, adding another task to her to-do list.

Omar called shot gun and bolted towards the van, but James beat him to it. There was nearly a fist fight until Margaret hollered, \"Would you two grow up!\" She fixed them with a glower. \"I\'m not in the mood.\"

Margaret turned up the CD player and let the sound system shake the car with the power of its bass.

\"Put your hands up/ like the ceiling can\'t hold us,\" Mackelmore song. Put your hands up. Doctor Hazey, Margaret was thinking. The ceiling can\'t hold a woman who needs health care.

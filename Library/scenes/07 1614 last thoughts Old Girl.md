07 1614 last thoughts Old Girl\
\
When the man\'s breath came less often...when a rolling rattle like the call of crows in the act of mating came from the back of his throat ... when his jaw opened slowly and only closed only halfway, Old Girl wanted to turn back the clock.\
\
Once his body got headed to the exit -- the exit she\'d hustled for, hoped for, stumbled toward, with all the naïve misunderstandings of gravity and how much it took to overdose and how fast you had to accelerate to crash -- she didn\'t want him to go.\
\
Stay! she wanted to tell him, even though she knew he\'d passed the point when  he could hear her some time ago. The steering column embedded in his chest had looked horrible when she first got into the truck. Once she settled in next to him and checked the moving blankets over it so it came up to his unshaven chin, she pushed the column out of her mind as effectively as if she physically removed it and glued him whole again by wishing.\
\
\"Don\'t let me die,\" he\'d said, reaching for her hand, his fingernails torn and ragged, hair plastered to his scalp with dirt and grease. Why did he look so alive when every detail about him looked raw and hard lived, as if life had been a wrestling match for him every second of every day.

More! She wanted to cry as cold seeped into the truck in the minutes that ticked relentlessly by.\
\
Why was it okay for a man she just met about an hour ago to exit this life? She'd done plenty of thinking about why her own death was owed to her.

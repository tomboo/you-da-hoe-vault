10192025 Traction Report 8 for Cynthia Hartwig

After three months of feeling like I was making progress on scene edits/re-drafts, I switched gears and worked on plotting. I thought by locking down plot it would make editing more efficient. My goal was to eliminate scenes or see if I could conflate characters for a more focused narrative. A noble idea, but it didn[']{dir="rtl"}t really work out that way.

I spent a huge amount of time writing a long form synopsis of almost all the scenes with action and consequences. It helped me see that the story has strong movement and lots of drama.

My synopsis document is not the 2-page, short form synopsis that tells the story of the novel in 2 pages. My synopsis tells the story at a granular level; it's about 15 pages long. It could be printed sales piece, maybe for book sellers or book store employees and pr/marketing people who need to know the story with a flavor of its high action, humor, and stakes. I had been thinking it was a document for me and perhaps my agent: It might be an addendum to the pitch packet. I could easily illustrate it to make it more visually interesting. I doubt other novels lend themselves so well for this kind of breakdown. That is the topic if our Zoom meeting on Tuesday, 10/21. I need to go outside.

I think this synopsis work will be helpful to me as I work on a visual Timeline of scenes that I can move around on my wall. But -- I have not done the wall board yet because I don[']{dir="rtl"}t have any index cards why I don[']{dir="rtl"}t just cut up colored paper -- one color per character -- is a mystery.

At the same time as I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been plotting, I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been using my mornings to re-draft emotional, turning points in the most necessary scenes. This is good because it clarifies the stakes and articulates how each character grows or back slides. It[']{dir="rtl"}s bad, because it generates a lot of work to transcribe, which I have been spending hours typing on.

I[']{dir="rtl"}ve also spent considerable time on writing in, around, over, even backwards, on the new novel opening chapter. I haven[']{dir="rtl"}t tackled editing the opening into a keeper yet, but I have a very large file of writing to pick and choose from which is strong.

The synopsis worked helped me figure out my chronology better and consistently has solved ["]{dir="rtl"}this needs to happen before that" issues.

What I[']{dir="rtl"}m perseverating about is that I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been working really hard but on so many France, it looks like I[']{dir="rtl"}m not making progress. I had a very long and terrible dream about being stuck in the rearrangement task and the dream tells me to return now to finishing individual scenes and perhaps chunks of the novel. I need to console myself with hitting some production goals. By making the mistake of staying too long in the land of continuous revision I am somehow making myself feel like this job will never end.

Rationally, I know that it will end. I will get to the finish line. But at the feeling level, it[']{dir="rtl"}s time to finish pieces so I don[']{dir="rtl"}t feel so admired.

One thing interesting about working with a book coach who I[']{dir="rtl"}m not exactly using to coach me: just the active writing traction reports is exceptionally helpful. It forces me to reflect on what I[']{dir="rtl"}ve been doing and it shows me that I[']{dir="rtl"}m not exactly stuck. I just need to circle back to all the work I[']{dir="rtl"}ve done and make sure it gets into the manuscript.

Working this way also reinforces in me the knowledge that I do know what I[']{dir="rtl"}m doing. I hope that this knowledge and experience will serve me well on editing. My next novel set at the garden of Eden serpentarium.

My initial focus on completing each characters arc of-change seen by seen feels like the way to proceed. Once I get all of the arcs of change per character drafted tightly, I can read the whole and order the book in the way that makes sense. If I can[']{dir="rtl"}t see it as a hole, I[']{dir="rtl"}m having Trouble with the correct order.

I will work on transitions between scenes after I set the order.

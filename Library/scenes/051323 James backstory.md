051323 James backstory

James's Dad, CEO of Life Monitor, a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a tenured professor at UCLA, as well as a neurosurgeon, were used to giving orders and being obeyed, like Lydia. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning. This was what Josh, his therapist, had reminded him right before James walked into Process Group. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked.

James's answer: You're the professional. You tell me.

Dr. Mom was always asking him why he did the shit he did. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time," was the only answer that made any sense to him.

When he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on lean or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka \-- it didn\'t seem to him that he had trouble staying on task or was easily distracted. He had great focus at basketball and track, both things he was good at.

Once, in a good moment with Dr. Mom, he asked her why he and Susan, his sister, were polar opposites. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system figures out how to talk to your frontal cortex."

He'd looked up the limbic system. As he understood it, the lizard brain housed all his fears and fuck-ups. The frontal cortex controlled the decision-making parts of his brain. Maybe his love affair with Circle K had fried his cortex? Or was he born with a cortex the size and hardness of a walnut? He asked Mom the day they were eating pizza on the way to his basketball game and she said, not unkindly, "Oh, no, James. Your cortex is the right size. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to the rest of your brain yet. You don't have enough neural connections."

He asked her how the hell he was supposed to make connections.

"Time---only time makes the brain connect." She sighed. "And judgement."

Maybe that's why Susan did so well. She had both good judgement and good genes behind the high, round Olson forehead. All those brains she inherited had programmed her to get straight A's in AP classes when he barely made it into Cal State despite a guaranteed varsity basketball spot.

Plain freckled Susan did exactly what she was supposed to do while James got derailed from his best intentions by any text or Chat from his pals.

Lydia's demand to meet her for stand-up sex in the bathroom--- even though he was beginning to hate the sight of her ---was no different. Susan would have said, "I have to study for my Calc test," while James\' Pavlovian response was always, FY,3A3.

Fuck yeah, anytime, anywhere, any place.

Today?

Fuck with Lydia?

Not if he couldn't get his brain to work with his dick.

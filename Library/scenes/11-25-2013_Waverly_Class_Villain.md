Waverly Class

Villain

Rusty watches TV and listens to Jerry Springer on when the girls are cheating on the men with the DNA of their cheatin ways appearing in their bastards he [\_\_\_]{.underline}, \"Slut! I knew she was a round heeled slut.\"

\"It\'s unfair,\" he murmurs sometime later. \"I didn\'t do nothing.\"

\"It is,\" Old Girl agrees that life isn\'t fair. She doesn't have a steering column sticking out of her chest, for example. She is the one who had laid down in the road expecting death to find her and instead, it found this dirty, stinking man.

\"What are you going to do?\" He seemed to be taking a philosophical turn. \"It\'s the way it is.\"

She\'d wanted to die for so long, it was hard to imagine a life directed at living. Instead of blowing her nose and wishing she was blowing her brains out, she now had to think about reaching for a Kleenex. Life was complicated and all she was thinking about was getting rid of past nasal drip.

Maybe the truck driver who picked her up would have one of those pocket packets of tissues. Or possibly a box between the seats in the cab.

You had a whole world of possibilities open up when you were thinking about how to live your life. Maybe she should just stop by a 7 Eleven and take some napkins.

Margaret lay in the flannel sheets wishing she didn\'t have to get up. Lloyd had turned and readjusted and punched the pillows behind his back a million times(he still couldn\'t sleep lying down because his back hurt.) It wasn\'t restful but Margaret didn\'t want him to feel abandoned and even though she had to get up at 5:30AM and throw out hay to the horses and the 3 cows they hadn\'t butchered in the fall. She\'d have to break the ice in the water trough with the axe. If she was lucky, which she doubted, she wouldn't\' have to go back inside and carry hot water to hurry the ice so the animals could drink.

In the dark she pulled on wool socks and Lloyd\'s packs, and went downstairs trying to be quiet so Lloyd, who was snoring, could finally get some sleep.

She set out the cereal boxes and brought the milk in from the Smith Bros delivery truck and muttered under her breath. \"Damn it,\" because she\'d forgotten to put the empty milk bottles out last night. Lloyd used to do it like clockwork but now that he was so heavy into Dislaudid, he was lucky to remember his own name.

While she boiled water for instant coffee , she ate at the sink standing up and thought about her to-do list at work.

It was like the list of stuff at home. It grew like beavers teeth and if she didn\'t chip away at it, they would eventually out grow her ability to choke them down.

FIRST POEM

I love you freshly picked plums

packed into mud buckets

squirrel --gnawed, rotting,

ready to distill into Slivovitz.

**IF I SAY SO**

I love you cubicle brain

fucking with my moods.

I love you stick of butter

that I promise to relinquish

along with my belief

in moping doves, iridescent

as films of oil on canal water

I love you seagull

stately seagull

bobbing on the swells

of a hundred-footer yacht

with huge white bulbous radar

motoring down to the locks.

I stride on the gravel path,

seagull proud, me the saint

blessing the homeless man,

head pillowed on a backpack,

jacket covering his face,

safe in public view,

sleeping on the grass strip

between the steep bank

and the path where now a line

of two-year-olds toddles,

one hand wrapped on a rope.

How docile they are,

and small and durable.

Their handlers, summer recruits,

stop to let them play

on the grass, half-gossiping,

half-supervising, I see

one bored girl

sneak over to the embankment,

slide down to the cement wall,

waves slapping its sides,

squat, then sit on an exposed

tree root to watch,

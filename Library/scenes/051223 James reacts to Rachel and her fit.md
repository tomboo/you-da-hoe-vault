051223 James reacts to Rachel and her fit

Process Group was officially toast by the time Darlene and Jerome, the van driver, loaded the new girl into the van and roared off to get her checked out at Kootenai General.

They rest of them spent the rest of the time before lunch processing the moment when the new girl lost it.

Lydia said the girl dropped in James' lap because she wanted to give him a blowjob. "I thought I'd have to fight her off you."

Reza, his annoying motor-mouth roommate, wanted to know why the girl didn't piss her pants.

"Because she was in James's lap," Lydia said. "Too much to do."

Old Girl was furious. "They must have known Rachel was epileptic!" she cried. "What the hell's wrong with those idiots? They should know stuff like that."

James usually avoided Old Girl rather than let her rip him a new asshole with her razor sharp mouth. The Seattle girl was pretty scary with that head of long, ginger-colored dreads. Her unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look was an expression he was deeply familiar with at the bottom of a tequila bottle. "Careful of what?\" he asked. \"Epilepsy isn't something you can plan for."

Big Paul, the silent, Aspberger math wizard, spoke in a rusty voice. "She looked like the Exorcist."

You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to correct him. Everybody else stared at Paul as if a ghost had spoken up.

"Why are you looking at me?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

Everybody laughed. Paul went back to his corner and doodled equations on the back of his hand.

When Lydia bumped James from behind, the sign she wanted to have sex, he wanted to shake her. How could she think about sex when he was shaken to the core?

Dr. Mom, a neurosurgeon, and a tenured professor at UCLA, was always asking James why he did the shit he did. Sometimes he asked himself the same question. "It seemed like a great idea at the time," was the only answer he could come up with.

When he was in his body and able to reflect -- not zoned out on lean or ready to explode with Red Bull and vodka \-- he had no trouble staying on task. He had great focus at basketball and track, both sports that required concentration that he loved.

Once, he asked Dr. Mom why Susan, his sister, was his polar opposite. "You're a boy, honey. You're wired differently. You'll grow out of it when your limbic system figures out how to talk to your frontal cortex."

He'd looked up the limbic system. As he understood it, the lizard brain housed all his fears and fuck-ups. The frontal cortex controlled the decision-making parts of his brain. Maybe his love affair with Circle K had fried his cortex? Or was he born with a cortex the size and thickness of a walnut? Dr. Mom said no. "Your cortex is normal. I could show you on an MRI. That's not the problem. It just doesn't talk to the rest of your brain yet. You don't have enough neural connections."

How the hell he was supposed to make neural connections, he asked.

"Time," she said, in her matter-of-fact way. "Only time makes the brain connect." She sighed. "And judgement."

So Lydia's demand that he meet her for stand-up sex in the bathroom off the living room --- even though he was beginning to hate the sight of her ---was no different than any IM or text from his pals that derailed his good intentions.

Susan would have said she had to study for her Calc test, while James\' response was "FYA3."

Fuck yeah, anytime, anywhere, any place.

Even if his heart said, but why today?

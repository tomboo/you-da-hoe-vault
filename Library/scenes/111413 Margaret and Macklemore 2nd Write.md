111413 Margaret and Macklemore 2^nd^ Write

Lydia cranked Charlie's sound system up to Def-Con Five. A drumbeat like the pulse of a giant heart filled the car.

Margaret liked music and thought Hazey's rule about making the kids "deplug from constant stimulation" was stupid. What would a little music hurt? She was thinking, about the time a rapper's voice took over the pulse. Maybe Hazey was right about rap. The insistent stabbing voice, the hand stabbing gestures, those boys who waddled duck-legged to keep their pants from falling to the floor.

Meanwhile, Reza, the math whiz and probable meth maker -- brains were not all they were cracked up to be---declaimed word for word with the rapper. The other kids clapped and shook their fists in the air.

So this is how to channel ADHD, Margaret thought. "Labels out there now they can't tell me nothing. We give that to the people. Spread it across the country." Reza and the rapper rattled in perfect sync.

And then everybody in the car was in on it. The voice shifted from rap-shout to actual singing and James, Lydia, Rachel and Reza sang along at the top of their lungs to an anthem that even Margaret wanted to join in. "...this is the moment. So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us, like the ceiling can't hold us!"

The SUV sped along on dry asphalt past covered fields ringed by blue trees. The occasional cow. A red tailed hawk perched like a funeral urn atop a telephone pole as the car rumbled by.

Margaret's skirmishes with Gretchen, her disgust of Hazey, her half- irritation and half-sorrow at Lydia's hangdog face when the got in the car receded and she, like the kids, was with the singer when he called, this is the moment. "Put your hands up! Like the ceiling can't hold us. Like the ceiling can't hold us!" she sang with them when the chorus rolled around.

Lydia hopped out at the Student Union Building and she surprised Margaret by smiling and saying, "See you at three." Who knew Lydia actually knew what time pick-up was because she'd never been on time in her life. Then Reza and James and Rachel climbed out and James handed Rachel her back pack, like a knight, and before he slammed the door, he stuck his blond head back into the car, all six-feet of surfer beauty, in that moment between youth and adulthood when he would never be more beautiful or healthy. "Thanks for the Macklemore," he said. "You're the best."

Margaret put the SUV in drive and cruised back to Healing House feeling like she'd finally done something right. She punched track 2 and the rapper---who called himself Macklemore?---called out, "Ay, Ay, Let's go" and she had no trouble following the words.

James and His Therapist and Parents in a Three-way

James didn't mind Bruce particularly. He was like an uncle you didn't grow up with. Partly bald, fond of flannel like most of Idaho, not too inquisitive. James spent a lot of time sitting on the therapy love seat---at first he was bummed that there wasn't a couch long enough to lay down on---but the love seat sat across from the window looked out on the lake and James liked watching the patches of ice form and reform out in its dark center. Bruce said Lake Couer D'Alaine was so deep, it rarely froze over but every day, as the deep freeze continued, the ice grew like outside Bruce's window as if it was in a pitched battle to close over the lake so it couldn't breath.

Today a gaggle of coots rafted together in the open water, a splotch of dark against green-gray water.

"Ready for the three-way?" Bruce asked.

James sighed. He'd never be ready for the three-way conference call between James, and his parents. Technically, it was a four-way since he and Bruce were stuck in Idaho and James's Mom was at her office at the Loma Linda Medical Center and his Dad was calling in from the top floor, corner office of the building he owned in Santa Monica.

"James?"

He realized he'd been woolgathering which was easy to do while Bruce droned on about the day's call plan. James was supposed to read the accountability letter he'd written that was meant to atone for all the shit he'd pulled that lead up to the Number One fuck-up he hated to talk about. Topanga Canyon. To say he'd rather have his teeth pulled out without Novocaine was putting it mildly.

"Ready," he said, meaning ready to run.

Bruce dialed hands-free and the 800-number music warbled above the long distance hum that drove his parent's crazy. Technological early adopters, his parents thought Idaho and LAN lines were somewhere back in the Pleiasaur Age.

Mom's voice\--"Dr. Marilyn Addison, here,"\--brought the smell of eucalyptus trees and orange blossoms into the room.

"It's me," James said.

Bruce said, "Bruce Lockyear, here, Dr. Addison. Let me get Mr. Addison on the line and we'll get started."

A dial tone sounded like a dead end. More music. Then Dad's booming voice "Jim Addison." He always sounded like he was expecting applause.

Bruce gave the progress report on James in a jocular voice, like he was reporting on James's day at preschool. "An A in coloring. A gold star for putting his blocks away. Able to sit during story time" is what James heard, when in fact, Bruce was reporting about his community service at the Povarello Center, a homeless center and food bank in downtown Couer D'Alene. All James did was lug sacks of potatoes around the warehouse and divide up groceries in brown paper bags for the "clients" which is how you were supposed to refer to poor people. "Clients" was a euphemism for "hungry" and "progress" reports meant "stuck in place." Bruce made James's on-time work record sound like sainthood. Ditto his grades in History 201 and English Lit class.

"Good job, honey! We're proud of you!" Mom said brightly.

Dad was silent as well he should be, when James had within the last six months totaled a brand new Corvette and walked away from a crash leaving a dying girl. It would take quite a few lifetimes of bagging potatoes to atone for that.

The Accountability Letter

You were supposed to list all the shitty things you did. That was the easy part. "Just do a laundry list of all the things you're not proud of" was Bruce's advice and the damn stuff would pop up when he was trying his best not to think of them. "Stole the housekeeper's money Mom left on the counter" appeared at dinner when he was reaching for the Brussels sprouts. "Smoked dope with Dante and Greg on the way to school" came up when Lydia was giving him a blowjob in the men's bathroom after lit class. Was that supposed to be a two-fer? Or did Bruce mean he should concentrate on past fuck-ups, not current ones. There was a limit to how much a kid was allowed to hurt his parents, wasn't there? Why rub their noses in the shit when he'd already ground them off?

Once you got the list down on paper, you were supposed to look at it and put yourself in your parent's shoes. Every bad thing was supposed to be accompanied by an accounting of how you recognized you had hurt them.

Christ in heaven. If you put yourself in James's parents' wing tips and Bruno Magli's, you'd be standing in blood.

Five minutes before the call, Bruce had faxed James's typed letter to both their offices. The next part of the assignment was for James to read the letter aloud. You wrote down what you did, you owned up to it in front of them, and then you made amends. That was the theory, at least, until James's throat started to clog up and his voice came began to croak at number three of a list that started with the light and easy and ended on the heinous.

"lied... stole...snorted coke... made dope brownies on the maid's night off...took out riding lawnmower at the country club and did wheelies on the greens..." James made the mistake of looking down the list at some of the dumb, thoughtless things he'd done and it felt like the words were strangling him. Mom and Dad, far off in sunny California, maintained a strangled kind of silence themselves. He tried not to imagine Dad's face when he fessed up to breaking into the Club and driving the golf pro's tricked out cart into a water hazard. He had just finished reading *Heart of Darkness* and thought he could hear the whisper of "The horror! The horror!"

He'd saved the worst for last, when the silence growing out of the speakers was deafening. James's voice grew softer and softer as he got more ashamed and the closing of his throat seemed to make his words unrecognizable even to himself. He wasn't speaking English, but some kind of tongues by the time he got to how he drank 10 tequila shots at a part up the Canyon and met the read haired girl who was leaving at the same time he was. It sounded like Swahili or Congolese---a language with words that he himself didn't want to know---and the words came out through a glaze of tears.

It wasn't until much later Bruce had faxed the accountability letter to Mom and Dad so they had it in their hands so they didn't have to translate all the evil shit he couldn't say without blubbering. This wasn't Bruce's first accountability rodeo. Did everybody bawl like a calf at the slaughtering pens Apparently.

When he finally choked out the last thing on his list, the speaker remained silent. He had a desperate hope that maybe Mom and Dad had silently slipped away during his confession. That's what he would have done in their place. Why listen to something you'd give your right arm not to hear?

Both Mom and Dad began to talk at the same time. "Oh honey!" (Mom) "Jamesy, dear." (Dad) It came out "Oh Jamesy honey dear" in a rush.

"We had no idea you were in so much pain," said Dad.

"If we'd only known, honey, we could have..." said Mom.

They tried for an interminable amount of time to make him feel better. James was looking at Bruce with consternation. "No! no! It was me. I did it. I fucked up and..."

Bruce cut in and held up his hand like a stop sign. "Let them talk, James. Don't interrupt."

James fell mute as his parents, Bill Addison, CEO and founder of a \$100 million medical device manufacturer, and Dr. Marilyn Addison, UC Davis Fellow and Director of Neurosergery at LomaLinda Medical Center chocked out their apologies. They were too busy to pay attention! Too mystified to know what to do! "I just thought it was hormones," his mom wailed. "All kids struggle."

"I was a hellion," Dad said. "I thought it was just a phase."

A phase that involved manslaughter and wandering away from a crash that killed someone?

As James listened to his parents, he realized that they were so busy excoriating themselves for their own failures, they barely registered his own faults. They were sorry... they felt terrible... their jobs... their business.... their patients.... had run away with them while James was left to grow up on his own.

By the end of the hour, James didn't feel like crying anymore. By the time Bruce intervened and thanked Dr. and Mr. Addison for their time and confirmed "same time, net week" for next week's three-way, James wished the black open water in the lake would close over him.

"I thought you were supposed to feel better for taking responsibility for your actions," he said to Bruce. "Why do I feel like shit?"

"Oh, kiddo, this is just the beginning," Bruce said.

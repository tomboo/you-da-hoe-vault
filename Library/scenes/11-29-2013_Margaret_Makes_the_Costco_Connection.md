Margaret Makes the Costco Connection

On her way into Costco, Magaret eyed the carts people had abandoned in the parking lot. It took maybe an extra minute to roll your cart to the return zone but people were too lazy\-- or just didn\'t give a damn to do it. Everybody do your part and the parking lot will be clear. That was Margaret\'s motto but apparently she was the only one who practiced what she preached.

A woman unloaded cases of Coke, a 50lb bag of dog food and an enormous stuffed kangaroo with its little paws up like it was ready to punch someone. Margaret had always wondered who bought those things. Her answer was a stylish grandma in a leopard printed pair of spandex and a pair of knee high pink fur boots.

She was finished unloading and Margaret was about to offer to take her cart back, when she decided to wait and see whether the woman would restore her faith in humanity.

Nope. She shoved the cart to the front of her Buick and drove off avoiding the lethal stare Margaret laid on her as she passed.

At the checkout counter, after an hour of treading down every Costco aisle like a rat looking for the cheese, Margaret surveyed the checkout lanes for one that was less than 10 deep. She chose one that had only 5 people but every single one of them had industrial flatbed carts like they were shopping for the flood.

Of course her cart wasn\'t much better. She was shopping for 30 after all. \--A case of Maalox? Margaret perused the list and stopped on that one. Who drank Maalox by the case? She\'d have to ask Gretchen when she got back. It wasn\'t Hazey. That man never worried even when all hell was breaking loose around him.

The next item was definitely Hazey\'s. A case of laxatives. The man\'s drug use had his whole system so stopped up you\'d see him disappear in the bathroom for hours. Gretchen had descended to lurking outside the john to get the good doctor to sign off an purchase orders and office supplies.\-\--

A familiar voice called out \"Margie? Margie Centerguard, is that you?\"

Centerguard was her maiden name. She hadn\'t used it since high school. \"Oh my word. Betsy Vance!\"

Betsy looked a hell of a lot better preserved than Margaret did. She was in front of Margaret in the line with a cart of groceries. Her hair was streaked with a professional mix of blond and brown and ash and she was wearing a professional pant suit with a silk blouse and high heels. Margaret was wearing her usual blousy top to cover an ass that was as big as a barge, stretch slacks, and Nikes.

Betsy had been one of her good friends in high school, before Lloyd and hormones took over. She\'d lost touch with her when she got pregnant and dropped out of school. Betsy had been a good student. Margaret heard though the grape-vine she\'d gone to Gonzaga and gotten a degree.

\"What are you up to? It\'s been a coon's age.\"

\"I just had my coon's wrinkles worked on!\" Betsy said. \"How do you like my face lift?\"

\"You? You had a face lift?\"

\"And an eye lift. And a laser job that hurt like hell.\"

Betsy\'s face looked different for sure. But good different. Margaret said truthfully, \"You look spectacular.\"

\"Oh honey, you were always the nicest girl in high school.\" Betsy hugged her and Margaret got a whiff of hairspray and a light flowery perfume. \"What are you doing with yourself?\" She was eyeing the case of laxative on top of Margaret\'s overloaded cart.

\"I\'m housekeeping for Inner Journeys\-- it's a rehab place for troubled kids.\"

\"That makes sense. You were always trying to rescue people.\"

I was? Margaret could hardly imagine her high school self before husband and kids and aging parents and Lloyd\'s back problems.

I just met your boss -- Harold Hazey? --he came into the bank the other day.\"

It turned out that Betsy, who was the branch manager at Wells Fargo had approved a loan for Dr. Hazey. \"Sounds like business is great,\" Betsy said.

\"Nuts R Us,\" Margaret said. \"You never run out of crazy kids.\"

\"Doctor Hazey seems like a ball of energy,\" Betsy said.

Betsy must have met him on a load of uppers Margaret thought thinking of Hazey\'s drooping eyes. When she went to get the Costco purchase order signed, he seemed practically catatonic. So old Hazey was in getting a new loan. What for? She was thinking.

By that time Betsy was handing over her Costco card. She squeezed Margaret\'s hand kindly, and said \"Let\'s have coffee and catch up.\" She handed her a card and Margaret read Betsy Vance Manager with a silent whistle.

\"You bet,\" Margaret said. \"I\'d love that.\"

\"Good luck on the expansion,\" Betsy said.

What expansion? Then Margaret put two and two together. Hazey had gotten a loan to expand the business? They were maxed to the gills and Gretchen had said a new kid was expected at the end of the week and Margaret wasn\'t sure where they going to put her. In the rafters?

Well that was good news. If Hazey expanded Inner Journeys with a new facility, he\'d have to increase her hours, wouldn\'t he? He\'d need somebody to run the new house or maybe he\'d move Gretchen to the new place (hallelujah!) and give Head of House to Margaret to manage.

By the time Margaret loaded up the van and was returning her grocery cart to the cart corral, she had her new job -- and commensurate salary figured out. The man next to her in a Subaru finished unloading his car about the same time she did.

She decided to try out her new managerial skills on him. \"I sure hate people who don\'t return their carts, don\'t you?\" she said.

He already moved the cart to the front of his car so he wouldn\'t back into it.

She smiled beatificallly at him\-- really beamed with all her wattage\-- and he succumbed to the power of suggestion.

\"You\'re a good cart citizen,\" she said. And waved to him to back out before her as his reward.

You just needed to give people a little shove to get them moving in the right direction, she thought.

Maybe she\'d send her idea for parking lot signs to the President of Costco. \"Be a good cart citizen.\" It had a nice ring to it.

Now how was she going to lean on Hazey to do the right thing?

I\'m trying to decide if I need a scene, from Hazey\'s POV of Margaret getting her promotion. We know Margaret\'s motivation\-- she wants fulltime work with healthcare. Hazey doesn\'t like paying P&W, he things of it like pillage and waste. But Margaret has secret knowledge of his drug use and he really does need someone to delegate to and she has a way with kids that many of his classically trained and educated therapists don\'t. They like her. They sense that she is in their corner and she talks turkey to them instead of therapy speak like \"out comes\" and executive brain function\" and DSMD 5 criteria.\" He wasn\'t sure but he thought he heard her mutter \"hog wash\" under her breath. It could have been \"horse shit.\" Something concrete you could see, smell or taste, he thought.

I\'ve written one scene of Margaret coming in on Hazey meeting with Gretchen, who\'s pregnant by Bruce a therapist. Therapists aren\'t supposed to misbehave but they\'re just as randy and fucked up as the kids they treated. That\'s why they got into therapy in the first place. It was why Hazey got into it, that\'s for sure. He\'d progressed past indiscriminate sex once he hit 50 but the other temptations of life-Chiva Regal, Xanax the occasional relaxing joint\--were always calling to him.

Hazey is confronted by Margaret\-- Hazey POV

Hazey hung up the phone with relief. He\'d been holding his breath ever since the fire and the threat of arson worried that it would queer his business loan. The bank manager, Ms. Vance one of those brass balls women\'s lib types had said he\'d passed \"with flying colors.\" This was after she\'d combed through his financials with a magnifying glass and a lice comb.

He reached in the bottom drawer for the bottle of Chivas Regal he kept on hand. It was 4 o\'clock in Idaho which meant it was 6 PM in Boston where he grew up and cocktail hour was the highlight of the day.

\"Here\'s to Inner Journeys bottom line,\" he toasted.

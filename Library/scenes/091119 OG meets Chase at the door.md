091119 OG meets Chase at the door

He gave a gasping kind of inhale at the end of his sentences. Words ran out at record speed. It was like he was always running out of air at the end of his thought so OG missed whatever his name was. It sounded like Chase, maybe. Jase? Or Mason? Every n dropped off into nothingness in his airless questioning voice, like even he wasn't sure.

In general, the new kid was pretty tatty looking. Sparse stubble, pale skin, a white-boy version of a fade, cadaverously narrow on the sides and long and floppy on top. After talking a mile a minute, he would pause for a long periods as if his brain was catching up to his mouth, along with his longs.d

When she told him her name, he shook her hand sort of, except instead of shaking her palm, he gripped her with his non-shaking hand around the forearm so they were locked together for an odd little moment. His eyes, blood shot as per normal for arriving at the Program, looked bruised around the sockets. He'd been in the wars, clearly. Why else would he be here except to put a stop to the personal mayhem?

Thin as a wraith. A palsied tremor in the hand that shook hers. He surprised her by taking hold of her forearm by the non-shaking hand for an odd moment of connection. She felt a stuffer and skip of a heartbeat like a hummingbird on full throttle.

"Good to know you." He peered at her face like he could barely make out her features. Twitchy but basically harmless. He was impersonally friendly, like most people, until they realized where they were and how long before they'd be able to get out.

Meth head was her first thought. Or crank head. What difference did it make? Whatever drugs were in his system were already being sweated out of him with no hope of more.

He was handsome in an underfed, feral way. Wavy thick hair on top of his fade. A Pattigucci jacket and tight black hiptster jeans. In the tiny crevice between his straight nose and cheek, a white head was just beginning to erupt. A tiny moon just itching for someone to come along and pop it with a satisfying explosion of puss and life.

A tiny white head was just rising to ripeness at the curve of his patrician nostril and cheek. It made him seem young and vulnerable. If she'd spotted the same whitehead on her own face, she would have excused herself and gone gaily to the bathroom to experience a healthy and satisfying pop. Instead, she looked discreetly away, telling herself to keep her strep-throat infected hands 30 seconds away from blowing her nose away from the boy's healthy skin. Don't offer to pop it for him, she told herself, until we get to know each other.

It was the white head that kept rising like a funerary dome in her mind. The boy was dead, for Christ's sake. What happened to that healthy excrescence, a sign of too many hormones, blocked oil ducts, unclean hands and not enough sleep? Was it even now draining into his stinking corpse? All its rude and bursting life doomed to drain away with the rest of the mortician's fluids and waste? What a waste, was all she could think.

His twitching, peripatetic eye. A kind of gasp on the inhale at the end of his sentences, as if he ran short of air in his haste to get out his run-on thoughts. This is why she mishead whether his name was Chasen or maybe Jason. He kind of swallowed the syllable at the end. Could it have been Mason?

OG was dimly aware that his heart seemed to be working overtime, when she thought about those few minutes of her life and even fewer in his.

She got stuck on that little perfect white head. Plump and so ready to pop, it had reached perfection. She had almost mentioned it in her feverish state but she managed to tamp down her instinct to point it out until she knew him better. Now she never would.

Plenty of time for that, she told herself, in the enforced Petrie dish of the Program. She hoped it wouldn't be too late for him to enjoy the spurt. She herself loved that moment of perfect ripeness and fullness. What a bummer to press on a pimple that was still underground without enough pressure to blow, and only enough pressure to bruise.

Adolescence. No one would tell you that one of its few joy was the perfection of explosive pus. That was the kind of joy that had kept OG going for days when she joined the Program with a terrible case of acne r. Chasen or Jason was in for a rough time in the coming days. The least she could do for him was point out his perfect zit.

The boy was so damned alive a few minutes ago. She could almost feel the racing heart beat again when she shook his girlishly thin fingers. He'd looked at her under long, girlishly-long eyelashes, a most feminine and endearing trait. He'd looked long enough at her for her to look away and focus on that perfect white head that was ready to blow.

Why hadn't she at least mentioned it. Now she wouldn't be able to. No one would be able to tell him anyting, not Margaret, who was holding a hand to the boy's cheek and bawling silent tears all over her light blue pant. His mother not his father, yet to be told the news that would forever separate this day from the golden Before to sunless After. Not stupid, clueless OG, who couldn't figure out how it was that he had been so blooming alive, goddamn it, and now he was dead. She hated all that acronym shit, L-O-L and all its B-F-F and L-M-A-O brethren but now at the far end of language's utility in extremis, all she could say to the fireman/medic who was patting Margaret on the back and waiting for her to stop crying long enough to sign a pile of forms on his clipboard, was W-T-F. She said it twice. One like a sigh, then like a whimper.

"He's dead?" she asked stupidly. "Where'd he go?"

It didn't make any sense. She'd seen him less than thirty minutes ago, so jittery and alive she wanted to tell him to chill.

She'd come back into the living room intent on telling him about his whitehead when she saw his skinny black-jeans sprawled half off the couch.

The front door stood wide open.

The boy's head and torso were hidden by a big medic who was counting out loud and compressing his chest. Another female medic was kneeling to the side breathing into his lungs on the same rhythm.

OG arrived and as if her appearance had something to do with it, the the woman breathing into the boy's lungs quit. She held up a wrist. "Time," she said. "Would you call it?"

The burly medic stopped mid-compression and raised his watch, saying, "Two twenty-two PM."

The next thing OG knew, the boy who'd been talking a mile-a-minute and twitching like a twerker only a few minutes ago was disappearing into a long white sleeve. The two medics expertly drew some kind of parachute material up over his histper Van's, his hipster skinny jeans, then a silk pajama top on the way over his white and no longer hip face. The whitehead, so prominent in real life, was swallowed up like his facial expression in the smooth susurrating of the shroud.

"What the fuck?" OG's voice came out in a scratchy, streptococcal croak.

Margaret, tears running down her grief stricken face, looked up from the couch and seemed to drag herself back into consciousness. "What are you doing up?" she cried. "OG, you shouldn't see this."

Margaret started at her and she enveloped OG against her neck. Pressed her into her warm and mighty bosom. She was still hiccupping and crying, trying to wipe at her whiles while at the same time, Margaret was trying to fold OG closer and pat her on the back and push her forehead against her shoulder so she wouldn't look on death with her virgin eyes. "Oh, honey," she breathed. "You shouldn't see this."

Too late to be unseen, OG thought, with her nose mashed into Margaret's ear. The smell of Tide and coffee and whatever that smell that was quintessentially Margaret rose up around her and made her own tears start.

OG had been hugged to rarely in the past few years. Never at Inner Horizons, only a few times by Aunt Peggy or occasionally stiff-armed by Uncle David. She was startled by the sense of solidity and warm that Margret's breath and bosom churned out. She felt surrounded. But in a good way, not in the stultifying get-me-out-of-here way that characterized all her other experiences with closeness.

Margaret's tears were running down OG's neck now. She heard a big tearing sound that was Margaret blowing her nose with the tissue that OG handed her from the wad in the pocket in her nightgown.

"Oh listen to me." Margaret sniffed. "You've been around plenty of death. What am I saying." She raised her head away from OG's neck and looked at the boy's body that was being loaded onto a gurney in what looked like a white tube sock. "It was just an accident, honey. He was fine when he came in. I came back in from those damn raccoons and he was already gone."

"Heart attack?" suggested the male medic.

"Aneurism, maybe?" said Margaret.

"Drugs, most likely," said the woman medic who came out of the powder room bearing a whitish baggy of nothing but powder and a silver coke spoon.

"Christ on a cracker!" Dr. Hazey shouts, a phrase unwittingly picked up from Margaret, when he exits Healing House behind the medics who are pushing a body on the gurney.

He catches sight of Dr. Evensong sprawled on his back in front of the Lexus like a bearded whale. Dr. Evensong, head of the Western States Certification Review Board, got out of the Lexus at the same time Dr. Hazey ran around the flashing lights and the fire engine into Healing House to see what was happening. Evenson was wearing Seattle dress shoes with slick new soles, though a sporty Russian hat with ermine flaps protected his ears and his Ph.D stuffed brain when his foot slipped on a rotting piece of lettuce abandoned by a raccoon.

Dr. Maydenhair and Dr. Grayson tiptoed around the back of the car more gingerly and temperately than Dr. Evensong.

These two junior members of the Certification Review Board had Dr.. Evensong propped up to a sitting by the time Hazey arrived with an unattached medic who assured the two psychiatrists, now twittering and chittering like the chickadees divebombing Margaret's suet feeder, that it was only a "small"l concussion. Nothing to worry about. Just don't let him go to sleep.

After Christ on a cracker, no other phrase sprung to mind. So Dr. Hazey pressed his lips together and paged through his mobile phone for the number for his insurance adjuster.

Dr. Hazy wanders out of Healing House on the heels of the body bag rolling out on a gurney. He spots Dr. Evensong flat on his back in a snowbank, one foot bedezined by a lettuce leaf. He promptly plants a foot on a chunk of ice missed by Margaret's chicken-feeding method of salt-shaking. He goes down like a brick shit house.

"Good thing the medics were already there," Margaret will tell her husband, Hank, when she ask him that night what the odds are for two concussions and one death in the space of ten minutes a la three strikes in a row.

OG witnesses the scene through the relight in the entryway. Dr. Evensong's head thwacks the newly shoveled pavement like a coconut just as of the body bag rolls out of Healing House. Margaret's "Christ on a cracker" merges with Dr. Hazey's "Let me help!" in his unwise effort to aid Dr. Evensong which results in a swan dive off the porch.

She hears one medic say to the trainee, who's there for a ride-along, "Days like this you pray for. Everything else is boredom."

**Margaret**

Around ten, Hazey called Margaret into his wood-paneled office. Gretchen, who was filling out menus, shot Margaret a Grinchy smile and Margaret\'s heart sank. Shit in a shoe! Had the witch ratted on her for saying her oatmeal sucked?

Margaret needed her crappy, low paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional psychiatric treatment facility West of the Mississippi." That's what Darlene, who'd been trying to land another job for months, had told a colleague on the phone.

Margaret couldn't afford to leave, no matter how crappy the job. Her husband, Hank, ruptured a disk moving a 300-pound patient at his job as a nurse at Benewah Health and they'd been living on one income for over a year. The taxes on their 10-acre farm were due next month. She had no idea how she was going to pay them.

Hazey had seated himself behind his gleaming walnut desk. Not a loose paper on it. Only a folder and a Mont Blanc pen shaped like a bullet.

\"Gretchen told me you contravened her authority and questioned her personal worth in front of the residents.\" ~~Hazey loved to talk in big words with giant mouthfuls of syllables.~~ In fact, what she'd said to Gretchen Beener, the world's only trained dietician unable to follow a recipe, was, \"This oatmeal tastes like charcoal. Did you put arsenic in it?"

The lack of focus in Hazey's eyes made him look like he was elsewhere.

\"The oatmeal was burned,\" Margaret said, carefully. \"The kids were complaining that it tasted foul.\"

\"They\'re always complaining,\" he said. \"They\'re kids.\"

Well, Hazey had that right. Even though all the kids in the program had psychiatric issues, they were still, at heart, kids. Quick to laugh at her dumb jokes. Quick to whine and complain. Quick to point out the disappointing behavior of adults. Just like her own kids in their teenage years, just more fucked up.

\"I\'m a good cook,\" Margaret said. "Maybe I could take over breakfast. Gretchen's always complaining she doesn\'t have enough time for meal planning.\" Gretchen was always complaining that she needed a cigarette which perhaps would account for the fact that every taste bud on the woman's tongue was dead.

Hazey was frowning down at the folder in his lap as if he\'d forgotten how to read.

Margaret waited a decent amount of time. When he still didn't say anything, she said, "Is everything OK?\"

He was staring at a glossy color brochure with a picture of a tropical blue ocean and palm trees. \"I need a vacation. The stress is killing me.\"

Hazey didn\'t look stressed. Reclined in his chair with his feet on the desk, he looked like he was in his early forties though he was 50, the same age as Margaret. He was tall with a full head of salt-and-pepper hair, freshly gelled. He wore his usual professorial tweedy sport jacket with suede elbow patches and neatly pressed slacks. The red paisleys in his tie looked eerily like red eyeballs.

Margaret couldn't take her eyes off the shoes that were thrust in her field of vision. One was a black wingtip with a shiny, flesh-colored sole. The other shoe was brown. A wingtip, too, but scuffed on a worn black sole.

"Dr. Hazey, do you know your shoes don\'t match?\"

He edged the palm trees over an inch and peered at the shoes resting like two large barges on the lake of the desk. There was a long pause, as if the news took a few heartbeats to reach his brain. \"Damn. I can\'t meet Lydia Hunt\'s mother in these.\"

Lydia Hunt's mother was making a fly-by? The only family of Lydia's that Margaret knew about were her grandparents who owned a worldwide freight hauling business in Detroit. She hadn't even known Lydia had a mother. Margaret racked her brain and couldn't recall any phone calls or letters.

"I thought her grandparents had custody?"

Hazey shook his head. His hair didn't move. "Her mother has custody but she has to see Lydia once a quarter or she'll lose it."

In Yakima, where Margaret came from, custody was when they drove you in the back of a police car to the Walla-Walla penitentiary. Did children turn into custodial assets if you were rich? Who cleaned the runny noses and wiped the asset's bottoms?

"Lydia swears she won't talk to her." Hazey sighed.

"Look on the bright side. The odds are good that nobody'll notice your shoes."

The next thing Margaret knew, whatever Hazey meant to tell her was supplanted by the shoe crisis, and she found herself behind the wheel of Hazey's Lexus SUV. She was amazed to drive a car with heated leather seats and only 1900 miles on the odometer. She sped out Highway 90 to Hazey's contemporary McMansion on the west shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene and then tramped from room to room looking for the master bedroom. The cold contemporary house had lake views from every window, with black slate floors and counters, and mostly red abstract art that looked like someone had thrown darts in a paint can. When she finally located the master suite, she found a black whirlpool bath and two walk-in closets that were bigger than Margaret's living room.

Hazey's closet held about forty pairs of shoes neatly organized side by side in mahogany cubby holes. Anybody could make the same mistake with so many shoes, she thought, except that the closet had a chandelier big enough to light up a town. Who would put a chandelier where no one would see it? Did whatever it took to earn a Ph.D. push out any left-over common sense? Margaret plucked the black mate to the wingtip on Dr. Hazey\'s size 13, double EE feet, and headed back to the kitchen.

She was about to leave by the side door when she heard the clanging of garbage bins. Outside in the driveway, she spotted Rusty Harrow, who owned the local dump. He picked up trash for the Program because unincorporated Kootenai County was too backward to have official garbage service.

Rusty was head down, pawing deep in Hazey's garbage bin, occasionally holding up junk to his inspection. Margaret assumed he was collecting whatever was salvageable to sell at the dump he'd inherited from his old man. Margaret had gone to high school with Rusty back in the day.

Something kept her silent and she melted back in the kitchen away from the window, where she couldn't be seen.

She was used to seeing Rusty pick up trash at Healing House and the other six residences that made up Hazey's psychiatric empire. Occasionally, she passed his rickety green truck turning onto Strenger Road from Harrow Dump on her way into work. She hadn't talked to him in years, other than to yell at him for leaving the bins overturned in the driveway or to remind him to pick up the yard clippings. He looked like time hadn't been much kinder to him than it had been to Margaret. Always built like a fireplug, his greasy hair was now receding and he'd gone to flab in the gut, though he was still powerfully muscled in his shoulders from a lifetime of hefting barrels. It was possible his Carrhardt overalls had started out light beige but they were now dark with filth. She remembered the musty, feral smell that trailed him in the halls of Coeur D'Alene High. It was possible he hadn't bathed since then. Everybody knew there something off about Stan Harrow, Rusty's dad, who started the dump in the fifties. He beat the shit out of all the Harrow kids until they ran off. Rusty was the only one who stayed.

Through the cat door, the smell of smoke wafted into the kitchen. Damn. Now he was taking a smoke break. Margaret, on no impulse she could name except curiosity \-- Pandora\'s box and all that \-- worked her way past red leather dining chairs and a shiny black Parsons table with unforgivably sharp corners. In the living room, there was not one but two large white sofas that would have stayed clean in Margaret's house for less than ten minutes. White? That capped it. Hazey truly was insane.

By the time she got back to the master bathroom, she had to use the black, low-slung toilet. Maybe Alma, Hazey's ex-wife who had run away with a horse whisperer, wanted to get away from the starkly modern decor.

Margaret idly popped the medicine cabinet. Holy shit! Hazey\'s cabinet wasn\'t just a medicine cabinet; it was the whole drug cornucopia that Inner Horizons stocked for the residents reconstituted in the director's bathroom. Her first thought was that Hazey must be dying. HIV/AIDS? But Hazey loved women, that couldn't be it.

She read labels for a prescription for Klonopin. Another one for Atavan. Diazepam. Valium. Delaudid. Tirazepam. A bottle labeled Klonazepam was prescribed to April Cohen. Margaret knew April as the starved New Yorker with the investment banker dad who moved her to McLain at Harvard when they opened their new anorexia wing.

She reached for another bottle belonging to Reza Silverstein. \_\_\_ milligrams a day of Ritalin.

Reza was the motor-mouth ADHD kid from Camden, New Jersey, who couldn't sit still for love nor money. Hazey had gained weight after Alma's departure but lately, he'd been bragging about how he'd lost twenty pounds "just like that." He punctuated how easy it was with a snap of his fingers. "Just say no!" he said. Was her boss saying No to food while he said Yes to Reza Silverstein's Ritalin?

Deep on the top shelf, Angela Livengood's name appeared on a bottle of Tirazedone tablets and Margaret's maternal hackles went up. Old Girl had a hell of a time sleeping. The kid was famous with the Night Supervisors as a card shark. It was common knowledge that if you needed help staying awake on your shift, all you had to do was walk by Old Girl's room with a heavy tread and she'd come out with a deck of cards.

Margaret liked Old Girl. She was wicked funny. Not a complainer. Personally, she would have preferred that Old Girl would bitch and moan or even howl at the moon if it helped relieve her unremitting depression.

Occasionally, Gloria, the nurse, would use Tirazedone to give Old Girl a night of rest; you couldn't keep her on it too long without getting dependent. Was Hazey using it to help himself sleep or to calm himself down? If the man got any calmer, he'd be practically catatonic.

After Process Group, Old Girl had asked Margaret about the danger of falling icicles. "You're not thinking of standing under one are you?" Margaret had asked.

"What---you think I've got a hole in my head?" Old Girl said.

"No, but I think you might want one."

"You never let me get away with anything!"

"Who would I have to bug if you weren't around?"

Old Girl had thrown a floppy deadlock away from her face and sighed. "Of all nut houses in the world, I get the one with Mother Fucking Teresa."

Yet another prescription for Tirazedone was made out to the new boy, James Olson, who had come from a Wilderness Program. If there was one thing Margaret knew about teenaged boys, it was that they slept the sleep of the dead and acted like irritable grizzlies if you woke them up. No way was James Olson taking Tirazedone for sleep. The boy was quiet, not like the rest of the magpies, so he wasn't taking it for anxiety either. Margaret had discovered a stash of books hidden under the boy's bed that ranged from Great Expectations to Moby Dick. Books Margaret wished she'd read at his age instead of Seventeen Magazine. Now she had no time to read because she had to fork hay out in the field for the horses or break the ice in their water trough with an axe, all the outside chores Hank used to do before he was laid up.

By the time Margaret counted up all the labels on the shelves, she had 89 prescriptions of a psychotropic nature, the majority for kids who had left the program.

About half way through her inventory, Rusty Harrow's truck rumbled down the driveway but Margaret\'s brain was too busy solving the conundrum of the enormous drug stash in Dr. Hazey\'s home bathroom. Hazey was writing new prescriptions for whatever drug he wanted in the names of every kid he\'d ever treated.

Most of the plastic bottles marching across the marble counter like faceless soldiers were dated from the last two years, all for kids Margaret knew or had known. Earlier than that, she had no idea who the people were. But those records were available in Hazey\'s office. Margaret cleaned there every week and she knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the top right-hand drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and anybody else who wanted to know things he didn't want them to know but was too lazy to hide.

By the time she started shoving bottles back into the crammed shelves, she regretted taking them down. Damn. What if Hazey, now incontrovertibly nuts in Margaret\'s mind, organized his drugs in a certain order? She randomly tucked the drugs in wherever she found space. Nothing she could do about it if Hazey figured out that she\'d spent an interesting half hour perusing his personal Pleasure Chest.

She was so distracted, she almost forgot the black wingtip she\'d been sent for. She\'d left it on the kitchen counter when Rusty Harrow sat on the front step and smoked his cigarette.

She remembered it when she was pulling the Lexus around in Hazey's circular driveway; it apparently had heated pavers that kept it free of snow and ice. She left the SUV running and retraced her path to the kitchen for it. A long curl of brown sausage skin twisted on the step like a coiled snake. Rusty Harrow\'s calling card, along with the butt he\'d crushed in the pot with the five feet high topiary rabbit that Hazey was so proud of.

**Lydia**

Her itch was the size of Godzilla. Lydia had been hoping the newbie would be a boy. Actually, a hella-boy with a hella-itch. She had been seriously bummed when the tall bleary-eyes girl named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when they told her she could have herbal tea!

James had stuttered all the way through his accountability list during Process: Darlene's lame idea of "welcoming" the new girl. He spoke to the popcorn-coated ceiling while a flush crept out of his shirt collar and climbed his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he couldn't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, could he? Wasn't that the purpose of high school?

James was definitely showing signs of wimping out on her. Lydia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Lydia's experience, boys were hella-horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch and its implacability, they dropped off like leeches too full to suck blood.

You could have knocked Lydia down when Rachel dropped like a pile driver into James's lap. Why James? The girl jerked and popped like the whore strung out on Angel Dust Lydia had seen in Times Square on New Year's Eve. *They should have given her the coffee,* flashed through Lydia's mind.

Darlene yelled at her to get a towel and Lydia ran to the kitchen. What the hell good was a fucking towel? she wondered, until Darlene rolled it up and forced it between Rachel's teeth. Lydia plopped in Darlene's chair while the seizure shook the girl like a rat terrier. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so scary Lydia couldn't watch, which was lucky because she spotted Darlene's bag sitting next to the wingback. A wallet was clearly visible on top. Everybody else tuned into the horror show, so Lydia plucked a twenty-dollar bill and it was safe in her pocket before the twitching finally stopped.

Darlene and Bruce bundled Rachel up in a blanket. When the coast was clear, Lydia nudged James from behind, their private signal, then slipped into the bathroom off the kitchen.

The bathroom was colder than a meat locker. She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the claw-footed tub naked from the waist down. It was outfitted in faux-homey Shaker shit just like the living and dining rooms. Heavy on blond oak --- even the toilet seat was wood grain--- with bead boarding on the walls and an old fashioned claw-footed tub the size of an iceberg. James had better be quick or Lydia would shiver herself into an orgasm. Was that even possible?

While she waited behind the shower curtain, she speculated on the purpose of the tub. Who would put a tub next to a kitchen? she wondered. Didn't people in the West get the concept of a powder room? Or was that an East coast thing? There wasn't even a showerhead in the tub. All the showers were at the ends of the dorm halls. She supposed they'd been added on at some point when they turned an old farmhouse into a crazy house.

Lydia could hear one of the maids at her aunt's mansion in Montreal where she always stayed when Mom got remarried telling her to "get in and get out" of the tub before David, her cousin, figured out she was taking a bath. The maids were afraid of him and they weren't the only ones waiting in dread for 15-year-old David to crawl in bed with her "to get to know her."

Maybe that was why David, who was three years older, started crawling in bed with her when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. This was perhaps the only kind thought she'd ever had about kitten-killer David. Was this Inner Horizons shit finally working? She dismissed the thought like a bad smell in the room.

The jingle of the shower rings cued Lydia to climb up James's body faster than Pavlov's dog. She threw her legs around his waist and James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He was kissing her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard. The door shut and the pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear. "That was close."

"Not as close as this." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands and held them away from his waist.

"Don't," he said. "I can't concentrate. Not after all the shit that went down."

By then, Lydia's itch was pounding like jungle drums. She had a momentary flash of empathy with the epileptic girl who'd had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Lydia was having inside without any flopping or jerking. "Don't concentrate. Don't even think!" If James didn't help her get off, she was going to fly into a million jagged pieces.

"Chill," James said, as the curtain rings jangled behind him.

The temperature in the tub dropped another twenty degrees. Pavlov's dog had an empty bowl.

060716 Conversation about sex with Lydia

Josh's expression was level. The gaze of a man looking through her skin to the ugliness underneath.

"Did it occur to you that you're going to hurt yourself if you keep doing this?"

Lydia snorted. "I can stop whenever I want," she countered. "I'm in control."

"Are you?"

Outside a garbage truck rumbled like a wounded animal. Its dump mechanism screamed as a heavy load of throwaways were swallowed up in its maw. Lydia had an inner vision of what it would feel like to churn in the stink and darkness, knowing she'd never get out.

"You think you're always in control when you have sex?"

"Sure. They all want me."

"Have you ever had it rough? Not everyone wants to be controlled."

"I like it rough."

"In the ass? With a bottle? It happens Lydia and I guarantee there'll be a time when you won't be in control."

Josh's yellow eyes seemed yellower in a random ray of light from a break in the snow clouds. He was leaning forward, really concentrating on listening to her. She was struck by the contrast to Darlene's constant knitting and counting stitches and casting off.

"I can handle myself. My grandfather would sue the shit out of them in they hurt me."

Josh smiled without humor. "Afterward, Lydia. What about during when they're whaling the shit out of you? Where's your precious control then?"

She heard the sound of a knife cutting through a cantaloupe at breakfast. The thunk of blade through fruit.

"I thought we were talking about having sex with you! How'd we get from that to taking it up the ass?"

"See. You can't even control the direction of this conversation. I've got a lot of training. Other men just use their fists."

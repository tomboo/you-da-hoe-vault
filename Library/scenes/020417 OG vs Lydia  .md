020417 OG vs Lydia

Lydia disliked Old Girl and Old Girl felt the same. If they bumped together, they sprang away from each other like magnets of opposite polarity. Old Girl thought Lydia was a selfish bitch and Lydia appeared to think the Old Girl was too good for the people around her, mistaking her feeling of being an outsider for being stuck-up.

Old Girl knew enough about herself to know that she wasn\'t stuck-up or egotistical. She definitely wasn\'t too good for other people and their sticky, tar-baby-ish connections. She had learned to be fearful and wary of getting too close like a feral cat who craves warmth and food and petting but is afraid of getting eaten if she gets too close. Lydia was the kind that pretended to be friendly but inside she had a diamond ice-crystal core than no one could touch. Fuck her all you wanted but don\'t ever try to connect with anything but what was at the surface because the deeper you went the more dangerous she was.

Old Girl had no need to pretend to be nice. She got more juice from radiating prickles like a hedgehog that was successful at protecting a soft mushy belly.

Lydia pretended all the time. She used people, got close to them in order to take from them was Old Girl\'s assessment.

Dr. Hazey asked her if it could be that they were two sides of the same coin and Old Girl wanted to hit him. Old Girl didn\'t want anybody to touch her and Lydia only wanted to be touched and fondled and she wasn\'t ready to see that both of them were using different strategies to attain the same result: distance that they both controlled obsessively.

Old Girl and Lydia rubbed each other the wrong way like two dogs fighting over the same territory.

Old Girl thought Lydia was a selfish bitch and Lydia thought Old Girl was a bitch. She didn\'t appear to care if Old Girl was selfish, self-aware or self-deluded.

Lydia had a selfie-stick up her ass.

In another place or situation, maybe the two of them could have bonded over their losses but not at Healing House where you were on your own and you had to bury your losses as if they meant nothing. You lost your edge if you let people know you were hurt. If you were busy covering over your lostness, you had enough to do to cover up your feeling sand project the lie that you were perfectly okay.

Maybe both girls felt the hole in the other one and pulled away from it before the could be sucked in. Healing House ws like that: if you had a hole in your heart and the other person had an equal or bigger hole, the last thing you wanted to do was acknowledge it.

Lydia went through life as a selfish bitch. Old Girl went through Healing House life as a long wolf-bitch. Bitches always, lonely suffering young girls, not so much.

In the days right after Old Girl moved into Healing House, Lydia tried to buddy-up to Old Girl. \"Sit next to me at Process. I\'ll tell you the score,\" she said.

The score, according to Lydia was who was scoring cigarettes, hash, candy, special favors from staff, or sex. Old Girl flinched every time Lydia gave up another secret understanding that it was only a matter of time before Lydia would score the truth about Old Girl and share it.

Old Girl walked away from Lydia in the middle of a funny story about how James\'s dick leaned to the left and it pissed her off. After that, it was open season between them. Scoring on each other took on a whole new meaning.

Old Girl felt herself looking at the events of Process Group like she was already gone.

She was thankful she\'d heard the last of the fucked complaining and blaming and bullshit. It was like disgesting herked up food then shitting it out with not enough nutrients for even a dog to eat.

Every time there was a newbie, it was a time of rearrangement and acting out and establishing a new pecking order. At Healing House you had to fight and claw and kick and scream to stay even or you would sink from the \"don\'t fuck with me\" group to the \"fucked.\"

MARGARET gives coffee to Rachel

The girl was practically having the DTs from caffeine withdrawal and Margaret took pity on her and gave her the latte she\'d brought in to work with her from Couer d\'Alene\'s new Starbucks. Gretchen went ballistic when she saw it. Jesus, it was a cup of coffee, Margaret protested. \"I didn\'t give her heroin.\"

**Lydia\'s perspective on OG**

Secretly, Lydia admired Old Girl. She had no problem with being alone\--preferred it, in fact\--which fascinated Lydia who was obsessed with having people around her at all times. She went through people in the Program like candy: for a while, she and Dani had been a posse, then when she outed Dani for stealing food, she had to switch to Reza until she started having sex with James which made Reza jealous and the little prick ratted her out for giving James\' head behind the garbage bins.

Old Girl didn\'t bother with hurt feelings or blow-ups or bullshit related to other people like Lydia did because she just ignored everybody. Her ability to be alone amazed Lydia, though she did everything in her power to never be alone herself. If she found herself alone, it always felt like nobody was there. Ergo, keep people with you at all times to convince yourself you weren\'t a ghost.

**James perspective on orogeny in Two Mouth Lake hike**

James was taking a class in geology at NICC where he learned about orogenesis, the process that birthed mountains. Was that what was going on in therapy with Josh? A kind of subterranean thrusting of all the dirt inside him into the atmosphere? It felt like all that rubble was bursting through his pores. Its weight was crushing.

**Lydia on orogeny**

On one of their long hikes, Lydia\'s mentor told her about orogenesis. They climbed a tortuous slope of scree and Lydia had been afraid that she was going to slip and fall 2500 feet to the stony valley below. \"You\'re looking at orogeny here,\" Gloria said. Lydia had to separate her words from the rushing wind and she heard her say \"erogeny\" and she was more familiar with the erogenous zones of her body than any other.

What a weird word to hold on to. It became somehow connected in her mind to her sex organs when Gloria meant the up-thrusting of mountains from subterranean forces. Erogenis or orogenesis, same difference she thought. It\'s all underground until unknown sources send it skyward.

Crepuscular rays from OG perspective

She had always thought of light breaking out from behind a cloud as God light. It looked like God\'s finger had touched the cloud and pointed, \"Right here is my handiwork.\" That fact that she didn\'t believe in God didn\'t dissuade her from this thought. It was how it would look if there was a God so that\'s also how it looks without.

Crepuscular rays burst through the cloud for one glorious moment, as if some greater being did exist if only for a few minutes. Old Girl didn\'t believe in God any more than she believed in the tooth fairy or all the other crap adults fed children. Her mother had believed in God devoutly and look where that got her. Smashed into a greasy spot on a train track that was probably lit by crepuscular rights right after the train hit.

110415 Lydia Reconstituted

(Lydia and Lorenzo are at a coffee shop in Coeur D[']{dir="rtl"}Alene sharing one cup of coffee."

["]{dir="rtl"}Aren[']{dir="rtl"}t you mad? I[']{dir="rtl"}d want to kill somebody." Lydia said.

Lorenzo took a swallow from the cup they were passing back and forth. Then stacked another sugar packet on top of the pile. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s more like I"m disgusted. Ashamed."

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re ashamed because your stepfather is an asshole?"

["]{dir="rtl"}No." He pulled out a rusty clown curl and let it spring back to mate with the wiry coils in his beard. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s just... it[']{dir="rtl"}s hard to grow up believing one thing and then see it[']{dir="rtl"}s a lie. Mormons believe family is everything. LDS takes care of LDS. And then he turns around and drops me off in Salt Lake with a ratty suitcase and a \$100 bill? How could I have been so clueless?"

Lydia adjusted herself in the diner chair, aware of the safety pin digging into seam at the junction of her thigh. If she sat one way, she could get away from its piercing sharpness. The trick was to position the pin so it could dig in to a new place and keep her attention with sharp, and breathtaking pain.

["]{dir="rtl"}How come you keep squirming around?" Lorenzo said. ["]{dir="rtl"}You look like you sat on a stick."

Lydia blinked. She felt like he[']{dir="rtl"}d caught her masturbating or touching herself inappropriately. Lorenzo would never in a million years understand why she had to punish herself. ["]{dir="rtl"}Oh, ha ha ha." She faked a laugh. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s this chair. It[']{dir="rtl"}s too big for me."

["]{dir="rtl"}So sit in another one." Lorenzo got up and brought another chair over from the table next to them.

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re got good manners."

["]{dir="rtl"}They really help when you[']{dir="rtl"}re homeless. I believe in saying please when I ask for a ketchup packet that[']{dir="rtl"}s going to be dinner."

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re kidding." Lydia sat sideways, ignoring the pin. ["]{dir="rtl"}Aren[']{dir="rtl"}t you?"

The idea that Lorenzo was hungry---that he[']{dir="rtl"}d gone hungry last night---shocked her. She couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t imagine someone starving in a coffees hop where people were paying \$4.50 for a latte and \$3.00 for a scone. In a lull in the chatter around them, his stomach rumbled. That confirmed it. She was sitting across from a real person who didn[']{dir="rtl"}t have enough to eat. She leaned forward to take his hand and nearly jumped out of her skin when the pin jammed into her crotch.

["]{dir="rtl"}Sell this." She pushed the Bottega Veneto bag her mother had given her at him, using every ounce of control to keep her butt in the chair.

Consternation flitted across his freckled face. ["]{dir="rtl"}Heck no. I[']{dir="rtl"}d never take something that belongs to you."

A selfish part of her was thankful he wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t going to take the bag away from her. She loved it. She remembered her mother buying it on the Via Veneto and being upset because she didn[']{dir="rtl"}t like the way it went with her shoes. She[']{dir="rtl"}d given it to Lydia because it was too much trouble to return it. So she was surprised when her hand seemed to act on its own volition when it shoved it to Lorenzo[']{dir="rtl"}s side of the table. ["]{dir="rtl"}Take it! Really, I couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t care less about it."

Why was the pin suddenly driving her crazy. It had been minding its own business tuck in her underwear seam and now it was on a mission to cut into her most private parts. She forced herself to sit back without changing expression. Between the pain in her vagina and the pain of removing her hand from the bag, she felt like she was going to pass out.

["]{dir="rtl"}Take it."

["]{dir="rtl"}Keep it."

Their words T-boned together like a car crash.

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re serious," he said. ["]{dir="rtl"}Why are you being so nice to me. You don[']{dir="rtl"}t even know me."

I know enough, she told herself. ["]{dir="rtl"}If you take it to Luxe for Less on E. Locust, you[']{dir="rtl"}ll be amazed what they[']{dir="rtl"}ll give you for it."

["]{dir="rtl"}Take it to the Lucky Luxe consignment shop of 3^rd^ Street. Don[']{dir="rtl"}t take less than \$500 for it."

["]{dir="rtl"}No way."

["]{dir="rtl"}I told you it was expensive. It[']{dir="rtl"}s a Bottega Veneto." For some reason, she was embarrassed to tell him what her mother had originally paid for it. A boy in a Cabela tee shirt and army surplus camo jacket didn[']{dir="rtl"}t even know her world existed, much less that she belonged to it.

He was as obdurate as a rock. No Never. Absolutely, categorically, no thank you, wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t take the bag from her.

["]{dir="rtl"}Why not? It[']{dir="rtl"}s worth a lot."

["]{dir="rtl"}Not to me, it isn[']{dir="rtl"}t," he said.

["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}re pretty principled for someone who[']{dir="rtl"}s living on the streets."

["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}ve got a job," he said. ["]{dir="rtl"}I get paid at the end of the week. I[']{dir="rtl"}ll make it."

She was so disgusted, she wanted to slap the purse in his meaty face. ["]{dir="rtl"}God helps those who help themselves!" she cried. God knows where the phrase came from. A maid? One of her revolving door of nannies growing up?

She stomped to the door, hearing his chair scrape the floor behind her. ["]{dir="rtl"}Wait, don[']{dir="rtl"}t..." The door shut ending his words with its slam.

All the way back to campus, she cursed him. Dick-turd-bastard-asshole-jerkoff- twat-cunt-fucker-fuck-off-fuck-for-brains-fuckity-shitting-shithead-dick. She was always the bitch! She makes e one uncharacteristic attempt to help the jerk and he throws it back in her face, the fucking idiot. Her anger at his refusal to take the bag that it physically hurt to give away burned in her as bright as a bonfire. She woke four or five times that night and she lay in bed and wondered what in the fucking hell was wrong with the stupid fuck.

When she woke up the next morning, she was bleary-eyed and exhausted. She looked automatically for the bag and saw the empty spot on the shelf where it always sat and she felt a terrible pang of sorry for its absence What she really needed was to find the asshole and snatch it back from him. He was so stupid, he[']{dir="rtl"}d probably settle for \$50 on consignment, not believing he could get 20 times that.

Then the realization hit her. Oh fucking fuckity fuck. Her Sociology notes were in the bag and so was her homework due today. Now she[']{dir="rtl"}d have to talk to fucking Lorenzo instead of flipping him off which would have been her usual M.O.

No good deed goes unpunished. Why did she have to learn everything the hard way?

Darlene-Lydia therapy session scene

["]{dir="rtl"}What[']{dir="rtl"}s got you so het up?" Darlene asked her in session. ["]{dir="rtl"}You[']{dir="rtl"}ve got three communication warnings this week. Now you dumped all over Esty and she can[']{dir="rtl"}t even fight back. What is making you so ugly to everybody around you?"

["]{dir="rtl"}I[']{dir="rtl"}m just mad." Even to her, her voice sounded sullen.

["]{dir="rtl"}I get that," Darlene said. ["]{dir="rtl"}But why? What are you mad about?"

She blew out a breath. The curls above her forehead were flopping in her eye. She pushed them back viciously. ["]{dir="rtl"}I need a pair of scissors."

["]{dir="rtl"}What for?"

["]{dir="rtl"}To get rid of this." She pulled a coil of springy hair out that reached below her nose. ["]{dir="rtl"}It[']{dir="rtl"}s bugging me."

Darlene moved behind her desk and handed her an orange-handled desk scissors.

Her anger got the bet of her and instead of cutting off two inches as she[']{dir="rtl"}d intended, she whacked off the curl at her hairline. She[']{dir="rtl"}d been holding the hank out straight and she was amazed to see five inches of curl dangling from her fingers.

Darlene took the scissors away from her and deposited them back in the desk drawer with a snick of the lock. ["]{dir="rtl"}That was an effective way to get rid of what[']{dir="rtl"}s bugging you. You[']{dir="rtl"}ve got a cowlick where you used to have a curl. How [']{dir="rtl"}bout if you say what[']{dir="rtl"}s bothering you before you go bald?

\"Shit,I can[']{dir="rtl"}t believe I did that,\" Lydia said. Still, the idea of cutting off every curl to the root had a sick kind of appeal. That would fix me. I[']{dir="rtl"}d look as bad as I feel. If wearing her mad on the outside would make it go way, she[']{dir="rtl"}d do it.

["]{dir="rtl"}I tried to help somebody yesterday. He wouldn[']{dir="rtl"}t let me."

["]{dir="rtl"}Go on."

["]{dir="rtl"}He... his name is Lorenzo," she said. ["]{dir="rtl"}He[']{dir="rtl"}s homeless. I met him at NICC."

Darlene nodded. Waited.

In dribs and drabs, the story of how Lorenzo refused to take the Bottega Veneto came out and by time she got to the part where his stepfather dumped him in Salt Lake City, the heat behind her eyeballs became unbearable and she had to choke the words out over her scratchy throat. Tears rolled down her cheeks and still, the hurt and anger continued to flow.

01272025 Narrator reports Baby Hanging Station

OG won\'t see Rachel\'s face when she completes her complicated seven-step facial routine at the sink. After Rachel applies the last layer of pore opener -- or is it the astringent that closes the pores and it\'s the one that's supposed to be last in the rocket science skin routine her mother begs her to follow. She looks up and gently pats at her face dry. She hears her mother\'s hectoring voice say, *never swipe or rub with a towel. You\'ll bruise the collagen. It\'s how you get old and wrinkly*.

Rachel is pattng mindlessly away when a spot of red on the Baby Changing Station sign behind her catches her notice. She turns and realizes that the capital C is scraped off thanks to the loan of Rachel\'s own diamond emery file. Now a capital H is painted with her Cherry Lush nail polish. The sign now proclaims itself a Baby Hanging Station.

Rachel\'s bown skin looks rosy and unlined, even though the loss of her baby has turned the heart inside her to leather. In that moment of shocked laughter, she feels hope creeping into her breast.

It could be worse: she could\'ve gotten psycho Danny for a roommate instead of OG who, according to the Healing House grapevine, is only clinically depressed.

091315 Old Girl Finally Acts

Old Girl's workedoff and on, on a ten page paper on Animal Farm all day. The problem was that Animal Farm was like a fairy tale compared to the Lord of the Flies shit all around her.

Three feet of snow had dumped in twenty-four hours and even in Idaho, where there was one snowplow for every other car, the roads were a blocked and classes at NICC were all cancelled. So few staff members made it in to work, it was decided to jam everybody into the living room so the Darlene and Gretchen could keep an eye on everybody at the same time. A shift from man-to-man defense to zone.

It was like Nature channel from then on with the survival of the fittest. First, everybody did that thing that involved making themselves big in order to make their enemies feel small. People dragged in blankets and pillows from their beds and laundry to be folded and old magazines and textbooks and school assignments and half-finished shop projects and they were out on every flat surface and wherever you walked. Taking up space worked with cobras and gorillas. Why not psychiatric patients?

Princess Danny, queen bee of the bulimics, and Reza, her sycophantic henchman, laid claim to an entire couch. Danny, over six feet tall and an ex-volleyball forward before she got kicked out of Ohio State, laid herself out like the Queen of the Amazons while Reza let her put her feet on him in the corner. Game tokens littered the rug like shrapnel and people were constantly stepping on them and bitching.

James and Rachel sat together, and they let Lydia budge in which meant Old Girl took up a place on the floor with her notebook, using the plaid couch as a back rest while she wrote.

At first, people were thrilled to have a snow day. No school---yippee! After a couple hours of close contact dealing with every mental disorder in the DSM became reality, the mood went dark.

While snow continued to fall in leaden, never ending streams, Darlene tried to relieve the boredom by organizing games but every time they played a game for more than five minutes, they'd have to abandon it for one Danny and Reza thought was more fun. When Big Paul got mad and snapped the checkers board in half, Darlene said No. More. Games.

Lunch was some inedible stew thing with floating chunks of unidentifiable meat. Lydia swore an ear had landed in her bowl and once that idea got lodged in people's minds, there was a run on the bathrooms.

By 3 PM, everybody wanted to put a knife in somebody's eye. Unfortunately, that was right around the time that Josh, who had four-wheel drive, dropped Esty off from two weeks in Stablization.

He and Darlene hauled her into the living room in a haze of Seroquel or Ziprexa or whatever anti-psychotic she'd been given to calm her down.

Nobody would say officially what was wrong with her. The fat, lardy girl was always prone to wall-staring and carpet watching but in the past couple weeks, she'd gone off like a firecracker three times. In her last blow-up, she'd clocked Ethan, the special needs therapist, with his digital clock. Maybe she had brain damage. Dropped on her head as a baby? Old Girl vaguely remembered her coming into the Program straight from Sacred Heart Hospital in Spokane after some kind of car crash. A big scar still zippered her bovine face and she lumbered with an odd, halting shuffle like a knee or a hip was messed up.

About the only rule at Inner Horizons that Old Girl agreed with was the one that forbade you to tell people what was wrong with you. God forbid you should want to share your troubles! "Don't ask, don't tell" was Old Girl's motto and frankly, it was a relief that Esty was too retarded to share her medical history.

All the kids at the Program hated her because she had no sense of personal boundaries. Once, Old Girl went with her to a dentist appointment in downtown Couer D'Alene and Esty dropped her pants in an open alley and peed like a cow pissing on a flat rock. A passing car honked when they got a load of the big white moon of her ass.

Generally speaking, she smelled musty and unwashed and after two weeks at Stable, she was completely rank. "Jesus! Can't you smell yourself? Go sit over there," Danny told Esty when she tried to sit down on her couch.

She moved to sit with Reza and the little shit held up two fingers at her like he was making a vampire cross. "Don't even think about it!" He threw his feet up on the worn plaid and Danny did the same. Esty finally just sank to the floor next to Old Girl who was using the flat part of the couch as a backrest.

Usually, Esty didn't bother Old Girl that much. At least she wasn't a motormouth like Reza or a bully and a whiner like Danny.. Today, though, in her zombified sad-sack state, Esty looked so lumpy and sorrowful, Old Girl could barely stand to look at her. If general blobbiness and abject misery was catching, she didn't want to be infected. It was bad enough to be Old Girl's sorry self without taking on Esty's problems.

"Paul's a hard-ass and you're a lard ass. What does that make me?" Reza said.

Old Girl muttered "dumb ass" under her breath. "A smart ass!" Reza crowed.

In desperation, Darlene, tried to cajole the group into going out to build a snowman like they were all six years old but nobody would bite. Everybody said they had homework, or Accountability Reports, or Personal Writing but once Darlene's back was turned, nobody did anything except pick on Esty.

Close to dinnertime, Esty finally woke up and lumbered off to the bathroom. While she was gone, Reza and Big Paul got to arm wrestling on the floor. One of them kicked over a glass of water that Old Girl had left on end table and they doused one end of the flowered couch. They ignored the spill, letting it soak into the cushions.

Esty came back and like a heat-seaking missile, she immediately sat down on the wet spot. When the whole room erupted in laughter, Esty's face was blank as a cow. She had no clue why everyone was hooting.

Jesus. Was Esty so slow that the neurons in her brain took an hour to tell her that her butt was wet? Apparently.

Reza said asked her how it was that she peed in her pants when she'd just come back from the can.

Esty wrinkled her forehead and said, "I didn't."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

More hyena howling and yipping. Esty She stood up and turned a broad, cottage-cheesed butt to the group, trying to peer at herself over her shoulder whileone hand groped behind her at the dark spreading stain.

Reza, with a weaselly gleam, said, "You just went to the bathroom. How come you peed your pants?"

Esty wrinkled her forehead. "I didn't."

"Then how come your ass is wet?"

"It isn't."

That made people howl like hyenas. You could almost hear the gears in Esty's drugged brain clanking toward the feeling of dampness on her pants. She stood up and turned a broad, cottage-cheesed ass to the group and tried to peer at herself over her shoulder as her hand groped at the dark spreading stain.

The real reason Esty ended up in Stable was because her roommate Danny had tattled on her for wetting the bed. Last week, Old Girl had been in the kitchen when Darlene told Margaret they needed to order a rubber sheet for Reza's bed because he kept soaking the mattress.

If Old Girl had been a bed wetter, she would have kept her mouth shut about somebody else who couldn't control their bladder. Apparently Reza's strategy was to pile on someone weaker with both feet and his kidneys the second he got the chance. Was it because hurting someone else felt so much better than being hurt?

By then, the whole group was jeering. "Esty needs a diaper!" "Stinker!" "Stanker!" Piss Queen!" You sure as hell didn't come to a psychiatric treatment program for the wit, Old Girl told herself for the millionth time.

Esty threw Old Girl a look of silent pleading. Usually Old Girl stayed out of the petty dramas and ongoing meanness at the Program. She was strong enough to fend off any bullshit aimed at her person. But today, all the torture Reza and Danny and Paul visited on Esty seemed deserved. Stupid Esty wouldn't fight back. She sat like a lump of Jell-O on the couch and took their jabs and kicks without defending herself. Did they torture her just to see if they could get a rise out of her? Was it some kind of need to get a reaction to prove they were the strong ones and Esty was the weak? Or was it just more fun to be the one doing the hurting than the one being hurt? To her surprise she realized Esty made her sick. If the bullies weren't already picking on her, Old Girl would have slapped her. "No wonder Esty stinks," Old Girl called out suddenly. "She's piss poor at holding her water!"

When Darlene finally rang the bell for dinner ("Meat loaf, yay!) it took Old Girl a few minutes to figure out what Danny and Reza's new game was. They'd recruited Paul for their deviltry.

Paul sat across from Esty on the far side of the table and Danny plopped down beside her while Reza took the chair on her other side. When the meatloaf dish was passed, Danny forked up a slice, then slid the platter across the table to Paul, who took a serving and sent the dish down the opposite side of the table away from Esty. Reza speared a boiled potato and sent the serving dish off in the opposite direction. He repeated the action when the butter came to him, then sailed the gray peas over to Danny who sent them up the table on her side. The only food that was allowed near Esty was the naked spinach salad garnished with two paltry egg slices and a lone mushroom.

"Hey, Reza, " Esty watched the rapidly emptying meatloaf platter traveling away from her. "The meat loaf skipped me."

Reza made wide eyes at her. "I passed it. You didn't take any."

"Did not."

"Of course you did," Danny said smoothly. "Right after I passed you the potatoes."

The only thing on Esty's plate was the midget-sized dinner roll the Program allowed people on the "high energy protein" diet. Skinny Reza, on the high fat diet, was busy shoveling glops of butter onto a mound of potatoes the size of Mt. Spudmore. "What?" Reza said, looking up. "The potatoes went around twice."

"Not to me, they didn't."

Darlene, seated at the head of the table, sensed something amiss and she interrupted her rant about black ice to Gretchen, and called out, "Esty, how come you're not eating?"

By then Reza had been passed the salad bowl and he took the opportunity to flop a gush of naked, wilting spinach on top of Esty's plate. "Have some greens, Stanker. They make your shit smell sweet."

Esty was frowning down at the spinach and for a split second, when she picked up her fork, Old Girl expected her to use it to flick the greens to the floor. Instead, Esty gripped the handle in her fist and drove the tines into the back of Reza's hand.

Reza tried to bolt up from the table, but he was stopped midway out of his chair by Esty who threw her considerable bulk over his torso and used her weight to drive the fork deeper.

"Ow! Fuck! Ow!" Reza's panicked howls punctuated a babble of voices\--"Bitch!" "Esty, let go!" Stop! Stop!"---while Danny's high pitched laugh went on and on.

Esty reached across the table with her free hand and dragged a slice of meatloaf from Paul's plate. She chewed thoughtfully while Darlene and Reza tried to dislodge her grip which had successful pinned Reza's hand to the table between thumb and forefinger.

Old Girl, seated at the bottom of the table, watched the herky-jerking bodies like a movie reel. She chewed and then carefully swallowed a bland boiled potato. Dessert was definitely off the table, she thought.

Feeling slightly nauseated and empty, Old Girl started picking up plates. Somebody might as well pick them up to avoid them getting smashed in the mayhem.

She butted one hip into the swinging door to the kitchen and stopped at the site of Danny burying her face and a lemon custard pie that Margaret had made to celebrate Danny\'s graduation.

The kitchen was quiet except for slurping, sucking sounds that Danny was making. Danny stood in profile to Old Girl, her blonde hair held away from her face which was partially submerged in the pie pan. When she met Old Girl\'s eyes, her eyebrows and eyelashes were dotted with clumps of whipped cream.

Old Girl set the stack of dirty plates down next to the sink. \"What the fuck? That\'s for everybody!\"

Danny stuck her tongue into the custard and lapped at it industriously as she swallowed pie filling and creamy glop and hoovered in large globs of crust without seeming to chew. It had only been 30 seconds, give or take, since Esty stabbed Reza with the fork. Old Girl could still hear Reza blubbering and whimpering in counterpoint to the commands of Darlene and Margaret to Etsy to let go.

Yet the pie for a dozen people was more than half gone.

\"You\'re sick!\" Old Girl cried.

\"Isn\'t everybody?\" Danny looked at Old Girl with a greasy beard of yellow dripping from her chin. \"Why do you think we are locked up here? You\'re just as fucked up as the rest of us.\"

> \"I\'m not!\" Old Girl cried. \"I\'d never hurt somebody like you do.\"\
> \"You just did,\" Danny said, using one hand to scoop a cream into her mouth. Her eyes were flat and lifeless as a corpse.

"That's for everybody!" Old Girl said again.

"It's mine, "Danny said. "For graduating early."

"You didn't graduate. You manipulated your way out of here."

"So?"

"So get your face out of that pie and leave some for the rest of us."

"Make me," Danny said with her mouth full.

And that's when Old Girl pushed Danny's head down into the lemon custard and ground her face ash hard as she could, feeling not full, but completely satisfied.

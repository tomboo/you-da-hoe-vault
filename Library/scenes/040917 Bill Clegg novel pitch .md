Dear Bill,

You saw something in *One of the Boys* that makes me think you respond to literary fiction that raises dread like bristles on the back of your neck.

My 70,000 novel, *You-Da-Ho* is about four young adults who are locked up together at Inner Horizons, a psychiatric treatment program in rural Idaho. Treatment is supposed to transform them from crazy to sane but nobody seems to realize that the doctor who runs the program is writing prescriptions for people who aren't there while a real psychopath stalks the treatment center in a garbage truck.

My novel asks the reader to determine the thin line between normal adolescent craziness and serious mental illness through the voices of snarky and profane young people who have experienced extreme tragedy and loss. At the emotional center of the story is a lonely, parentless 18-year-old called Old Girl who decides between the bliss of suicide and the pain of life.

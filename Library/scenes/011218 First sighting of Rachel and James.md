011218 First sighting of Rachel and James

Since she had only been at the Program a week, OG had no idea what Rachel was in for. She came escorted by a pair of middle-aged men on Friday afternoon which told OG that she came from money and not much else. The night of arrival, her dark skin seemed burned out to the color of putty. How did suck dark skin read pale with shame and uncertainty when it would normally be the color of eggplant or dark coffee? Supported on either side between two god spouting Christians in matching Soldiers of the Savior ski-jackets, her eyes looked lifeless and dull as a firepit begrimed with ash. Or did she just look burned out because in fact she was?

The night she arrived, she looked burned out and grim, dark as a firepit begrimed with ash.

Against the snow, Rachel's coffee colored skin looked darker and richer than she did behind four walls at Healing House. Was it a trick of light or did she just look more in control and less unsure of herself in the usual Lord of the Flies whiteness of the Program?

OG had no idea what she was in for. It would inevitable come out in Process Group. Usually it leaked out in tears and snot and swearing against the families that had locked them up and thrown away the key.

Rachel, a graceful slender girl in her late teens, looked taller than OG who was 5'7" when she cared enough to stand up straight. She was welcome to keep her secrets as long as she could. They would be yanked out of her and stomped into an ugly tear drop tattoo of the prisoner on her forehead soon enough.

James, a tall lanky basketball player from Malibu, had put on weight since coming into the Program in the summer for drug addiction. He'd arrived from Wilderness Camp skinny and emaciated as all the anorexic girls. She'd sat next to him at dinner and watched him put away an extraordinary amount of the inedible food so she was pretty sure he didn't he had an eating disorder. Now that extra nutrition came in handy because he supported her most of the way down the trail with Rachel on her other side, doing her part to keep OG upright.

James, a tall blond basketball player from Malibu, had some kind of drug problem like half of the people in the Program. Lydia was a cutter and a bulimic and anorexic. Was there a DSM diagnosis for just being a selfish little shit? Reza was a meth addict, but also ADHD and painfully immature and an utz and a thief. Nobody it seemed was just one thing; they all had multiple diagnoses and syndromes, any one of them bad enough to get them sent to a lockdown psychiatric treatment center in rural Idaho that specialized in troubled adolescents and young adults as old as 25.

Danni was upset about her nail job getting messed up but she shut up when Rachel held out hands that looked like she'd been in a fist fight after all the scrabbling and digging to get OG out.

It was the group hug that sent OG stumbling backward, fighting to get out the scrum. One be damned, I have to have air. It was the touch, the hands and arms that held her to the circle, held her to this earth that she wanted to escape. It felt cloying and claustrophobic as the cold airless weight of the snow had not.

She was in her body fully now. The flush and heat. The scratch in the back of her throat. Her eyes teared with something acidic and biting as bile.

Next to her in the scrum, Rachel leaned against her shoulder, her weight becoming unbearable in OG's panic to get away. What the hell? It felt like Rachel was trying to cling to her and for an instant, OG thought she was trying to hand on to her to keep her in the circle. But then Rachel listed further and the heaviness increased and OG found herself holding the girl up until gravity took hold and Rachel fell backwards.

Rachel's weight on her shoulder increased and OG found herself instinctively throwing out her arms and she caught the girl's body as she sagged to her knees. Then Rachel fell backward, just missing the edge of the coffee table. A horrible twitching and jerking took over her body as if she was being taken over by an alien being.

It took the scrum some time to figure out that the group hug had devolved into something out of the Exorcist.

James was on his knees next to Rachel, holding one bouncing leg and looking panicked. OG, opposite him, screamed, "Help! She's having a fit!" The spit of good will and bon homie scattered into shards as the new girl in their midst was taken over by a demon spirit. The whites of her eyes showed vacant as her eyes rolled back in her head like a Kewpie doll. Her mouth opened in a silent shout. Her feet clacked a tattoo on the hardwood floor that sounded like gunshots to people who hadn't seen her go down.

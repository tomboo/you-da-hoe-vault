[The sky Below]{.underline} by Stacey D'Erasmo

[The river turned entirely gold, solidified. I could barely see the building now,]{.underline}

[it had dissolved into the blaze of light, but I could feel the taut stretching,]{.underline}

[the hollow in my chest that pulled me toward it.]{.underline}

Their bodies turned totally dark, invisible. I could no longer see the boys, they had dissolved in the cave of night, but I could feel their connection, the invisible cord that tethered them to this earth.

[\]{.underline}

[It might be beautiful, too, gorgeous strong tendons and a translucent, cool,]{.underline}

[jade-green alligator heart. In case you ever get swallowed by one, you could]{.underline}

[look around in the jade-green light and see what was in there. Pieces of garden]{.underline}

[hose. Baby rattles. The bottom curve of the cool, jade-green heart, like the sun]{.underline}

[hanging on the horizon of another planet.]{.underline}

It could be peaceful, too, muted thick quiet and deep summer's heat, calm sunset python-loving heat. In case you ever get embraced by one, you might listen hard in the sunset heat and hear what pulses there. Whisper of in-sucking lungs. Stomach gurgles. The sweating wet of the close sunset heat, like waking from nightmares on a sweat-soaked sheet.

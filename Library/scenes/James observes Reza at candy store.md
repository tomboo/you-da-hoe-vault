> REZA BEAT JAMES TO A MASSIVE ARRAY OF CANDY at Walmart. It was Friday, allowance day, so they'd guilted Margaret into stopping so they could spend their lousy five bucks for the week.
>
> From the distant end of the aisle, Reza looked to James as if he had Tourette's Syndrome. Reza's body was in constant, nervous motion. He hovered first in front of the bulk candy, as if torn between the jelly beans and the candy corn, then he moved on to peruse the LifeSavers and Skittles, then he touched all the chocolates on the opposite side of the aisle before wandering back to ponder the Bubble Yum and FireBalls. He seemed to want the candy, had to have it in fact, but couldn't settle down long enough to make a purchase.
>
> James finally walked up to him and said, "It's not an entrance exam."
>
> "Might as well be," Reza answered bitterly. "When you want everything and can't have any of it."
>
> "You've got five bucks. Pick one."
>
> "That's it. I can't just have one. I have to have all of them."
>
> James got the idea that Reza was revealing something germane about himself but what? It was like his roommate was caught between wanting the candy and not wanting the candy because his selection would always be the wrong. It was the way James had always felt about drugs.
>
> "I'm not choosing anything. It'll just make me sick," Reza said, turning away.
>
> "Are you diabetic?"
>
> "No."
>
> "Then what makes you sick?"
>
> "Jesus, forget it. Go distract that guy at the counter. I want to steal some cigarettes."
>
> Reza's hand was again hovering, now over the Baby Ruths, then wavering above the Skittles. On to the Mike & Ike's.
>
> "Come on, Margaret said five minutes. We gotta go."
>
> "I can't decide."
>
> "Jesus, Reza, just put some sugar packets in your pocket and then you don't have to decide. Sugar's all the same when it gets in your body."
>
> Reza immediately brightened.
>
> "Hey, that's a good idea. It's all sugar, right? My body can figure it out and then I don't have to choose."
>
> James went up to the front and paid for his Hershey Bar at the counter. He chalked up Reza's indecision to his typical lunacy. Who could understand Reza if he didn't understand himself?
>
> Back in the van, he watched Reza pour packet after packet of sugar down his throat.
>
> "Not bad," Reza said, after the fourth packet. "Kind of boring. I like the texture of Skittles better. They're chewier."
>
> "How can you eat straight sugar?"\
> "You suggested it. Plus I still have my \$5 and what do you have?" Reza gestured to the empty Hershey wrapper in James's hand.
>
> It was then that James understood that he knew zero about what made Reza tick---or anybody else, starting with himself.
>
> Reza poured two more packets into his mouth. Let the papers fall to the floor. Margaret bellowed, without turning her eyes from the wheel, "Pick that up or I'll make you swallow it."
>
> "Where'd you get that third eye?" Reza asked.
>
> "Motherhood," she said.
>
> "My dad loves candy. Now he can't eat it because he'd diabetic," confided Reza to James.
>
> "I like candy okay but it's not really my jones." James was thinking about all the other jones that got him into more trouble than a super-sized bar of chocolate.
>
> "I really like to eat jelly beans in front of the old man because it drives him crazy. He wants to eat sweets so bad, he's practically shaking with rage when I hoover them down."
>
> "Nice."
>
> "You don't torment your parents?"
>
> "Not with sugar." James preferred codeine mixed with tequila or Ecstasy or weed or selling Adderall to fund whatever other torments were on his list.
>
> "My mom says I have his genes and sugar might come back to bite me."\
> "Are you worried about that?"
>
> Reza poured another sugar packet into his mouth. "He's old and fat. I'm never going to be like him."
>
> Margaret snorted from the driver's seat. "Don't bet on that. It happens quicker than you think."
>
> Both Reza and James rolled their eyes, secure in the knowledge that the future was ordained for other people.
>
> Reza's foot swung back and forth like a metronome, "I feel calmer."
>
> "Good," James said. "I was beginning to think you were having a heart attack."
>
> Reza had the last laugh. A few days later, James found eleven empty sugar packets in his pocket .
>
> The night of the Walmart excursion, Reza sloped in to their room from brushing his teeth in only tight whites and a ribbed undershirt. Bowlegged, concave in the chest, he walked like a South Asian cowboy in red Vans mashed down at the heel. If he weighed more than 120 pounds, James would have been surprised.
>
> "Did your mother feed you enough?" James asked him right before lights out were called. "You look like someone put you on a starvation diet."
>
> Reza blinked. "My dad's the chief economist at Goldman Sachs. Mamiji would die if she heard you say that. I've always had plenty to eat."
>
> "You're pretty...". James wanted to say 'skeletal' but settled on "...skinny."
>
> "I'm vegetarian," Reza said, like James was clueless. "Pakistani people aren't pig-fat like you Americans." He gestured toward James as if he was lumping him into all the overweight people they'd just seen at Walmart buying huge garbage sacks of Cheetohs and chips.
>
> "Sorreee," James muttered. This cultural sensitivity stuff was harder work than it looked.
>
> "Look on my bright side, Olson," Reza said, a minute later.
>
> "Why?"
>
> "When you're fifty, you've weigh 300 pounds and I'll still be able to wear the same clothes."
>
> "Not on your life," James said, thinking that'll be the day. Judging from Reza's expression, he was thinking the exact same thing.
>
> Decades later they would both be wrong. They'd be fifty pounds heavier but the good news was, they wouldn't remember.

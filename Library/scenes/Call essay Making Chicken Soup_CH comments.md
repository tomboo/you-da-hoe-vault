**Making Chicken Soup From Chicken Scratch**

Wendy Call

*Adapted from a speech given at the Chuckanut Writers Conference on June 20, 2013.\
Early draft of an essay for ????*

As we pass through this quadrennial exercise in derision and division, I like to remind myself that we are at heart a cooperative species. Always, everywhere, human society enmeshes us in collective processes.

It has always been this way. The longest-surviving art in the world shows us that. "Cupules are rounded pockmarks beaten into rock. It is our longest-surviving art, not the world's first art, because it's unlikely that early humans would have chosen some of the world's hardest rocks as their very [first]{.underline} canvases.

![https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSELksgMatyisml0TupnjrKwudrHFu9VNtu8w45M56oSfiCsihA](./media/image1.jpeg){width="1.7756944444444445in" height="1.3520833333333333in"}The oldest cupules that we have found, in Australia, are at least 290,000 years old.[^1] They have also been found in what is now California and Indiana in North America, in Bidzar, Cameroon and in southwestern France. Art is so old that it's not even unique to our species: *Homo sapiens sapiens*, or modern humans. *Homo neanderthalensis*, as well, made cupules. Even Neanderthals were artists**.**

Yes, visual art is nearly three hundred [eons]{.underline} old. Nearly three thousand [centuries]{.underline}.[^2] Writing---Sumerian cuneiform---is probably only five thousand years old. Humans have been making visual art for sixty times longer than they have been writing. If our entire history of art-making were one calendar year, we would have started writing six days ago. Cupules are made (yes, *are*---there are places in the world where they are [still]{.underline} being created[^3]) by groups of people pounding stone tools onto a rock surface for a very long time. Many hours, over weeks or perhaps even months. Creating these cupules was [performance]{.underline} before it was a permanent art installation: A group of people creating a collective rhythm, drumming stone on earth. It was a process, before it was a product.

In English, "art" is not a verb, but "write" is. For a very long time, I did not think of myself as an artist by any stretch, even as I received grants and attended residencies that were supposedly "for artists." But as I've come to learn more about that troublesome word---ART---it's changed my thinking about what I'm doing---what all of us in this room are doing.

![zapotec-writing.jpg](./media/image2.jpeg){width="1.6625in" height="3.379166666666667in"}Twenty years ago, I encountered the oldest writing in the Americas---about half as old as Sumerian cuneiform. I visited one of the sites where it is located, Monté Alban, in Oaxaca, Mexico in 1995 and again in 1997. I started at the beautiful stela and took pictures of it, but I had no idea that it was the first American writing until I visited with a local historian in 2001.

As far as we know---and we don't know much---Stela 12 commemorates the dates of kings coming to and leaving power in early Zapotec society. On a flat stone, burnished by many hands, many centuries, and many storms, fat dots balance on lines and anvil-shapes; thick circles enclose water-carrying pots and birds and monsters.

Sometime around 600 BCE, twenty-six hundred years ago, the Zapotecs started carving glyphs onto stone pillars. (As far as we know, the Maya got the idea of writing from them.) Those Zapotec glyphs might be one of only two times in world history that writing has invented, rather than adopted from another culture.[^4] Historians are pretty sure that writing was invented no more than six times in world history; we are far better mimics than we are inventors.

Before I learned about cupules, I thought that five thousand years was an extremely long time.

When I saw the Zapotec stelae at the Monte Albán ruins in Oaxaca, it was a deep, esthetic experience for me. I was struck more by the beauty and elegance of the stelae, than I was by the fact that I was looking at one of the hemisphere's oldest manifestations of my trade. Only later did the latter fact really sink in for me. In some ways, this personal experience of mine mimicked our fundamental, human experience with reading and writing.

As a species, we've been speaking for even longer than we've been making art. But we've only been reading and writing for 5,000 years---not nearly long enough for our anatomy to have been selected, in an evolutionary sense, for this activity. We have to adapt parts of our brain that are specialized for other purposes to learn how to read.

Stephen Pinker, a Harvard psychologist, says, "Children are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be bolted on."[^5] *Must be bolted on.* In our minds, we are building a beautiful, quirkily imperfect contraption when we write, and also when we read. How, exactly, are we wired? In the occipital region of the human brain, there is an area that recognizes objects, the fusiform gyrus. Nearby, there is a specialized area for recognizing faces. In the fold between those two areas, called the occipto-temporal fissure, is the area that recognizes written words.[^6] So, *stuff* gets the whole fusiform gyrus and writing only gets a fold.

In Zapotec, Mayan, and many other languages, the same verb means "to write" and "to draw." The act of putting a story on the page is an artistic act. Of course, literature began as an oral tradition, and those griots[^7] and bards and troubadours[^8] and al-hakawatis[^9] saved our poems and stories for us, until we could write them down.

Ellen Dissanayake, who is an ethologist---one who studies behavior---says that art-making is a core behavior of all human communities, going all the way back to the earliest humans. (I learned about cupules from her writing.) Her idea that art is a core human behavior leads to an obvious next question: *What is art?*

She has an answer for that, too. She says there are five elements common to art practices all around the world, through all time.

\[need transition -- or something else \-- here\]

Other than a childhood obsession with books, there was little in my early life that hinted I would become a writer. (I did *aspire* to be a writer, but by the fifth grade I had been made to understand that was simply not a viable career path.) I have a scrapbook that my mother kept while I was in elementary school called "School Years." It includes a page for each grade, with an envelope for class pictures and report cards. Each year I was supposed to list my friends and accomplishments and note what I wanted to be when I grew up. The page read:

"When I grow up I want to be---

BOYS:\
Fireman\
Policeman\
Cowboy\
Astronaut\
Soldier\
Baseball player\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

GIRLS:\
Mother\
Nurse\
School Teacher\
Airline Hostess\
Model\
Secretary\
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(This was 1974.) For the first several years I dutifully marked "school teacher. Finally, in fourth grade, I noticed that blank line at the bottom and wrote "librarain." This was probably the strongest hint that I would end up being a writer: I loved books, but I didn't know how to spell. My parents quickly put a stop to my literary aspirations---humble though they were. The next year I wrote: "vet / archeologist." I was veering toward science, though I still could not spell.

Charles Bowden---one of my favorite writers---said: "We land on writing after a bunch of other vocations simply don't work out."

Getting back to Ellen Dissanayake: she says there are five qualities that define all artistic practice, throughout human history. These five elements are her answer to that prickly question: *What is art?*

**Element** **#1: Formalization: patterning and simplifying.**

Dissanayake says: "This is what artists do. They simplify." "They are performing operations on reality and they are making it *more* interesting." Anyone who has ever published any work of nonfiction, no matter how long or how short, has realized that it is a great, hubristic act of oversimplification. As my friend Sasha Su-Ling Welland says, "Writing nonfiction is taking an eyedropper to a waterfall." In the end, all writing that attempts to represent the world in some way---whether it's nonfiction or not---is simplifying.

**Element #2: Repetition "in space or in time."**

There is nothing more satisfying than a literary work that masters repetition, and nothing more annoying than one that bumbles it. (See Elizabeth Bishop's poem "One Art.")

**Element** **#3: Exaggeration.**

Think about? those ridiculous faces that we make at babies. (Yes, really!) Why do we do that? Why do we all act like imbeciles when we are within a yard of a baby? Ellen Dissanayake explains in her book *Art and Intimacy* that such behavior is deeply embedded in our humanity. We are teaching those babies how to read social cues, how to engage with other humans, how to prick up their ears for a good story. It begins even earlier than bedtime stories. Dissanayake says that all five of the elements of "artifying" are transferred to infants by their caregivers.

Even if we are writing the most rigorously fact-checked, deeply researched nonfiction, we are exaggerating in some ways---even as we are simplifying. We are trying to hold the reader's attention---which is no small feat.

**Element** **#4: Elaboration: "Making special." "It's *not* life, it's** **better."**

Ellen Dissanayake uses the term "making special" is a synonym for art. (It's a less loaded word than "art," she says.) The point is not whether it's beautiful, or whether the critics approve, but whether it is set apart from the commonplace---even as it is part of our daily lives, even though it is available to everyone.

This key element--- "It's not life, it's better"---is something I was slow to learn as a writer. My early efforts at writing creative nonfiction were awful for many reasons, but one of the most oft-cited reasons was boring dialogue. Finally, I took a workshop with Ted Conover, and he told me, "Dialogue is not conversation. It's conversation's greatest hits."

Bob Shacochis often (and rightfully) says to aspiring nonfiction writers, "Just because it happened to you doesn't make it interesting." Just because it happened to *anyone* doesn't make it interesting. The job of the writer---of any creative person---is to "make special."

**Element #5: Manipulation of Expectation**

Good writing subverts people's expectations. Surprise is the most delicious literary experience of all. As Emily Dickinson put it: "If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry."

Ellen Dissanayake sums up:

These five things I've identified are proto-aesthetic primitives---they are there in our brains and we respond to them in any modality, whether its visual art or music or dance. ... \[I\]f you say that artists of the present day are also using those same operations, then it does make a continuity from the Pleistocene, or actually from the bower birds or song birds to the present.[^10]

Though I am still uncomfortable with the label "artist," I use Ellen's five elements as a checklist for my writing. My chicken scratch, or the chicken shit that fills my notebooks, through practice becomes chicken soup. That feeds me. Heals me. That I can give to others.

In order to read and write, our brains have had to repurpose neurons that evolved to do other things. But through practice, our brains can rewire themselves. We have known that such rewiring is possible for more than half a century. (Unlike many hypotheses in neuroscience, this one seems to be standing the test of time.) D. O. Hebb wrote in a 1949 book what has come to be known as "Hebb's principle":

"The neurons that fire together, wire together."[^11]

\[transition needed here?\]

Dissanayake says art is one of the few activities in which *all* human communities have engaged through *all* of human history. I believe that storytelling is, as well. We have been creating visual art for something close to 300,000 years, but we've probably been talking for half a million years.

![IphoneJuly-Sept2012 900.JPG](./media/image3.jpeg){width="2.6770833333333335in" height="2.0833333333333335in"}Before beginning a new essay, I sometimes look of the Chelan pictorgraphs. These pictographs tell an old Northwestern story in bright orange and rust red. At the head of Lake Chelan, on the far side of Cascade Pass---the crossing-over place---it was created sometime between 600 years and 3,000 years ago. I look at this image to remind myself that I'm part of a long tradition. To remind myself that I'm not trying to be original, or to entertain, or to educate, or to castigate, but simply to participate in a long human tradition. I don't have to strive to make it art. The honest attempt alone "makes special."

Wendy:

In answer to your question about whether this speech can make an essay, I say resoundingly yes. You're making interesting points about what is art and what sustains an artist in making art that is part of a conversation that goes back thousands of years.

In present form, I feel that your main theme is hard to track and I'd like to see this essay adhere more closely to theme and variation. It has wonderful thinking

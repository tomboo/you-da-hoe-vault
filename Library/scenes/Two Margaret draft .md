Two

HAZEY CALLED MARGARET INTO HIS OFFICE at 9 AM. Gretchen, the nutritionist, shot her a Grinchy smile. Shit in a shoe! Had the witch ratted Margaret out for saying the oatmeal sucked?

Margaret needed her crappy, low paying job at the "worst run, most dysfunctional psychiatric treatment facility West of the Mississippi." That's what she\'d heard Darlene, who'd been trying to land another job for months, say to a colleague on the phone.

Margaret couldn't afford to leave, no matter how crappy the pay. Her husband, Hank, ruptured a disk moving a 300-pound patient at his job as a nurse at Benewah Health more than a year ago. They'd been living on one income ever since. The taxes on their 10-acre farm were due next month. She had no idea how she was going to pay them.

Hazey sat enthroned behind his gleaming walnut desk. Not a paper on it. Only a folder and an expensive gold fountain pen the shape of a scepter.

\"Gretchen said you contravened her authority and questioned her personal worth in front of the residents.\" How Hazey loved his big words with chewy syllables. In fact, what Margaret had said to Gretchen Beener, possibly the only trained dietician in the world who couldn't follow a recipe for oatmeal, was, \"Are you trying to poison them? This shit tastes like charcoal."

\"The oatmeal was burned,\" Margaret said carefully. \"The kids were complaining. They said it tasted foul.\"

\"They\'re always complaining,\" he said. \"They\'re kids.\"

Well, Hazey had that right. Even though all the kids in the program had psychiatric issues, they were still kids, at heart. Quick to laugh at Margaret's dumb jokes. Quick to piss and moan. Quick to point out the disappointing behavior of adults. Like her own kids in their teenage years, just more fucked up.

\"I\'m a really good cook,\" Margaret said. "I could take over breakfast. Gretchen's always complaining she doesn\'t have enough time for meal planning.\" Really, she was always complaining that she needed a cigarette, which perhaps accounted for the fact that every taste bud on her tongue was dead.

Hazey frowned down at a glossy color brochure with a picture of a tropical blue ocean and palm trees for so long Margaret wondered if he had forgotten she was there.

She waited a while. When he didn't say anything, she finally asked, "Is everything OK?\"

He looked up with an air of mild surprise. \"I need a vacation,\" he said. \"The stress is killing me.\"

Doctor Hazey did not look stressed. He reclined in a big leather chair with his feet on the desk. At 49, the same age as Margaret, he looked like he took care of himself a lot better than she did. A tall tweedy man with gelled salt-and-pepper hair, he wore his usual professorial sport jacket with suede elbow patches and pressed slacks. The paisleys on his tie orbited crazily like red eyeballs.

Margaret couldn't take her eyes off the shoes that were thrust in her field of vision. One was a black wingtip with a shiny, flesh-colored sole. The other shoe was brown. A wingtip, but scuffed on a worn dark sole.

"Dr. Hazey, do you know your shoes don\'t match?\"

He slid the palm trees over a fraction of an inch and peered at his feet. They looked like two narrow barges on the lake of the desk. The shoe news seemed to take a long time to reach his brain. \"I can\'t meet Lydia Bronfmann's mother in these.\"

Lydia's mom was making a fly-by? The only family that Margaret knew about were Lydia's paternal grandparents, the ones who made a fortune in liquor in Michigan. Margaret racked her brain. She couldn't recall Lydia receiving phone calls or letters from anybody else.

"Don\'t her grandparents had custody?"

Hazey shook his head without a hair moving. "Her mother has custody but she has to see Lydia once a quarter or she loses it."

In Sandpoint, Idaho, where Margaret grew up, custody was where they took you in the back of a police car to the Cottonwood penitentiary.

"Lydia said she wouldn't talk to her." Hazey sighed and flipped to a page of elderly sunbathers without wrinkles baking near a cerulean sea.

"Look on the bright side. She probably won't notice your shoes," Margaret said.

The shoe crisis co-opted whatever Hazey meant to say to her. Ten minutes after she got to his office, Margaret found herself behind the wheel of Hazey's Lexus SUV. She was amazed to drive a car with heated leather seats. Only 1200 miles on the odometer!

It was easy to spot Hazey's glass and concrete house on the west shore of Lake Coeur D'Alene. It was the only aggressively contemporary place in a neighborhood of log houses that were built to look like cabins but were five times larger than the one Margaret had grown up in.

Margaret's lower back twinged at the size of the enormous river-blue and rusty slate driveway. It was the only spot of color in a uniformly snowy neighborhood. Hank couldn't lift a bag of dog food since the accident so she'd spent an hour that morning shoveling out the rutted country lane they lived on.

She stepped out of the Lexus onto a driveway dry as a desert. Did Dr. Hazey have his own oasis where the sun shone only on his house? Shit and crackers! It hit her. Dr. Hazey had a *heated* driveway.

Normally the fact that Hazey made more money than she and Hank would ever see in a lifetime didn't bother her. But the thought of a 5% raise \--was that too much to ask? \-- did cross her mind.

Hazey was fond of saying that Inner Horizons was an albatross around his neck. In a bad mood, it was also a vampire that sucked blood.

Quite a bit of blood had been sucked to build the glassed-in, two-story entry. Polished cherry floors. Oriental rugs. Margaret's dream of having an electric garage door opener embarrassed her for the poverty of her imagination.

By the time she passed not one but *two* white sofas that would have stayed clean in Margaret's house for five minutes, she was convinced Hazey truly was insane.

She found the master bedroom in the back of the house. Forty-some pairs of shoes were arranged in the closet in deep mahogany cubbyholes. Anybody could make the Hazey's mistake with so many pairs of shoes, she told herself. But the chandelier in the walk-in space was big enough to light up Spokane. Who on earth would put a chandelier with a million crystals where no one could see it?

Black wingtip in hand, she was about to leave by the side door in the kitchen when she heard the clang-clang of garbage bins. On the front driveway squatted Rusty Harrow\'s big green truck. The bed was piled high with trash barrels. Rusty ran the dump and picked up trash at all the Inner Horizon's buildings because unincorporated Kootenai County was too cheap to vote for garbage service.

Margaret spotted Rusty himself, head down in a garbage bin. He was pawing through it and holding up junk for inspection to see if there was anything salvageable to sell.

Margaret hesitated, hidden behind the curtain.

There was no reason on earth not to march out of the kitchen door with Hazey\'s shoe, get in the Lexus, and drive back to work. All she had to do was nod at Rusty. Say something polite. \"How\'s it going?\" \"Fancy seeing you here.\" \"Long time no see.\"

She snorted. Having a normal conversation with Rusty Harrow was like having a normal conversation with Dr. Hazey. You just never know what strange journey you\'d go on.

Was she embarrassed at watching the man eat half a salami that Hazey had tossed in the trash? He was the one who should be embarrassed to be caught eating out of garbage. Maybe that was it. Margaret felt sorry for Rusty and didn\'t want him to know she\'d seen him. He wasn\'t so far gone from humanity was he, that he wouldn\'t care?

Something was just off about Rusty Harrow. Actually, there was something off about all the Harrows, starting with the old man, Stan Harrow, who set up the dump Rusty now ran back in the fifties. It was hidden on the other side of the butte from Healing House, about a mile and a half as the crow flies, but five miles away by road.

Stan beat the crap out of those kids. Three of the Harrow boys were older than Margaret. Rusty was in the same grade as Margaret in elementary school and they continued in class together until he dropped out of high school. She still remembered him coming to school with occasional bruises. Once when she sat behind him in the 8^th^ grade, a trail of dried blood ran out of his ear.

These days, you'd call CPS.

Back then, everybody turned a blind eye. What people did at home was their business.

No wonder all of Rusty's brothers and the one sister--- Helga? Helen?--got the hell out as soon as they could. All except Rusty who'd inexplicably stayed on. When Stan died in a trailer fire, Rusty took over the dump and eked out a living picking up trash from people who paid him under the table.

Now and again, she'd see him at one of the six repurposed private homes that comprised Hazey's psychiatric empire beyond Healing House. He was still driving his old man's ancient stake-bed truck. Amazing that the old junker still ran. She hadn't talked to him in years, other than to yell at him for leaving the bins overturned in the driveway.

He looked more like Margaret than she cared to admit. He\'d put on quite a few pounds. He'd always been stocky, but now his black, greasy hair was graying \-- at least hers wasn\'t receding \-- and he had a beer gut. His muscular shoulders were powerful from a lifetime of hefting trash barrels. Margaret could still remember the musty stink that trailed him through the school hall. Was he still allergic to bathing?

The smell of smoke wafted past Margaret's nose. It was coming from the cat door. Damn. Now Rusty was taking a smoke break.

Oh, the hell with it. Why not wander around and water Hazey\'s neglected plants until Rusty finished his snack and went on his trash-eating way?

Margaret dutifully filled a juice pitcher and gave the poinsettias gasping on the dining room table a drink. Here it was late January and Hazey\'s Christmas decorations were still out. She picked up a bunch of leaf droppings on the mahogany. Then, remembering a sad spider plant in Hazey\'s bathroom, took her juice pitcher of salvation back to the master bed room.

Hazey\'s bed was unmade. A pair of worn pajama bottoms festooned the bed. A certain dishevelment had cropped up in Hazey's dress after Alma's departure. She preferred thinking about her boss as an overspending, luxury-flaunting chucklehead than a lonely, slightly down-at-the-heels aging man who was unraveling at the seams as badly as his pajamas. Ewwww. More plant crap on the bath tiles. And a balled-up pair of boxer shorts outside the shower. There were some things you really didn\'t want to know about your boss.

With her back aching from all her shoveling, she spotted the medicine cabinet and thought she\'d grab an aspirin. She opened the double-doored cabinet and did a double take.

Holy shit!

Hazey\'s cabinet was stocked like the cabinet at Healing House that was kept locked for its residents. Margaret\'s first thought was that Hazey must be dying. HIV/AIDS? But Hazey was completely asexual. Uninterested in either sex. So that didn't fit.

A bottle of Klonopin. Another of Atavan. Diazepam. Valium. Delaudid. Tirazepam. Clonazepam. Margaret perused one label. It was prescribed to April Cohen whom Margaret remembered as the girl from the Bronx with terrible anorexia. Her investment banker dad moved his daughter to McLain when Harvard opened their new eating disorder wing.

A bottle of Adderall had a label written to Reza Silverstein. Reza was the ADHD kid from Camden, New Jersey, who couldn't sit still for love nor money. A week or so ago, Hazey had been bragging about how he'd lost twenty pounds "just like that!" He punctuated how easy it was for the pounds he\'d gained after Alma ran off with the horse whisperer to fly off with a snap of his fingers. Just say no! he said. Was her boss saying No to food because he\'d said Yes to Reza\'s Adderall?

Angela Livengood's name showed up next on the bottle of Lorazepam. Margaret's maternal hackles went up.

Old Girl had a hell of a time sleeping. The kid was famous with the Night Supervisors as a card shark. It was common knowledge among the night staff that if you needed help staying awake on your shift, all you had to do was walk by Old Girl's room. She'd hustle out at all hours with a deck of cards.

Margaret liked Old Girl. She was wickedly funny. Never complained. It would have been better if Old Girl did bitch and moan or even howl at the moon, if it would help her depression.

Right before Process Group, Old Girl had asked Margaret about falling icicles. She wanted to know if they were dangerous.

"You're not thinking of standing under one, are you?" Margaret asked.

"What---you think I've got a hole in my head?"

"No, but I think you might want one."

"You never let me get away with anything!"

Old Girl lipped one floppy deadlock away off her forehead and sighed. "Of all the nut houses in the world, I get the one with Mother Fucking Teresa."

"Who would I have to bug if you weren't around?" Margaret had said.

By the time Margaret was finished with her inventory, she counted up 89 prescriptions of a psychotropic nature, the majority for kids who had left the program.

While she was counting, the rumble of Rusty\'s truck departing the driveway registered dimly but she was busy solving the conundrum of the drug stash in Dr. Hazey\'s bathroom to waste time worrying about crazy Rusty Harrow.

Dr. Hazey was using up and then writing new prescriptions for any drugs he wanted in the names of kids he\'d treated. Those records were available in Hazey\'s office. Margaret knew this because she cleaned his office every week and she also knew that the key to the locked file cabinet was kept in the right-hand drawer of his desk. Handy to Hazey and handy to anybody else who wanted to know what he didn't want them to know but was too lazy to hide.

What the hell was wrong with Hazey and where was his housekeeper? Margaret saw nine Grape-nuts-encrusted cereal bowls in the kitchen sink. In the fridge, there was a single carton of milk and two bottles of Röderer champagne. Margaret's Costco-stocked cupboards and jars of home canned fruit plus a freezer full of Sausage, the pig Hank had raised and butchered last fall, made her life look pretty full. Did the man eat out every meal except breakfast?

What a life.

She was so shaken by her discovery, she forgot the damn shoe she'd been sent for. She remembered it on the way out of his gated community by the sign that said Kootenai Reserve. Reserved for everybody but the Kootenai Indians, they meant.

The shoe was on the kitchen counter where she left it. Size 13 Triple EEE Brooks Brothers. A hole wormed its way through the sole.

Hazey. He was crazy as a loon, she supposed, but he was her loon. Now what in creation was she going to do about it?

She rearmed the alarm system and then stepped out on the porch and nearly jumped out of her skin. A long coil of salami wrapping looked just like a coiled snake. A calling card from Rusty Harrow. Margaret stepped over it. Shit on a shiny shingle. Dr. Hazey could pick up his own trash if he wasn\'t drugged up to see it.

Margaret was officially on a mission. How was she going to use the news about Hazey\'s Pleasure Chest to her own advantage? Hazey should stop that shit and fly right. No wonder Inner Horizons was a mess. The boss was writing prescriptions for people who weren\'t there. How about using the big brain the crazy and lazy head doctor was born with and applying it to the kids?

Mission? Hell, Arma-damn-geddon. Margaret was on the war path.

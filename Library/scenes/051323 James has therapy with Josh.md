051323 James has therapy with Josh

James shot the Coke Josh gave him, wishing it was Red Bull. Reentered Josh's book-filled office after washing his face, thinking glumly of that moment Reza wouldn't pass the meatloaf at dinner while he and Lydia and Dani were circle-jerking food away from Estie. James had wanted Reza to send the plate his way and shouted "Move it, Monkey Boy!" an instant before Estie drove the fork into the back of his hand.

In the aftermath of Estie's removal to Stabilization while the big girl kicked and flailed and screamed, Reza was carted off to the hospital with the fork still sticking out of his hand, howling in pain. James had forgotten all about calling him Monkey Boy until a few days later, when he realized Rachel had stopped talking to him.

The expression on Rachel's face this morning at breakfast reminded him of the ice freeze on Lake Couer d'Alene. If Estie hadn't shattered most of the dishes when she held Reza down with her bulk, Rachel's stare would have smashed the rest of them to shards.

"Exciting," was Josh's comment, when James reported what had gone down last night at dinner. "Bet you'll pass the peas faster next time, won't you?"

"You think I'm going to sit next to Estie after that? You're insane."

"Pretty sure I'm treating you, not the other way around."

"Well, hurry it up. I'd like to be cured and get out of here. My basketball is suffering."

"So would Reza. Can't you see that?"

A long silence. Fucking Josh. Always pointing out the unpleasant smell in the room. "Are you implying that Reza and I are alike?"

> "What do you think?"

"I wish you wouldn't answer every question with another question. It's annoying as shit."

> "How do you think Reza feels when you call him Monkey Boy?"
>
> How did Josh know about that? "So who ratted me out?" 

"It's called 'staff meeting', James."

Reza was so annoying. All James wanted to do was to slap him away like a midge or a gnat and the suggestion that the two of them weren't all that different slapped him up the side of the head. Reza was a fuck up. A different kind of fuck up than James, sure, but James, adjusted to his own brand of fuckery, was apparently too fucked up to acknowledge it. Now that he'd forced himself to admit that he'd fucked his parents, it was easier to acknowledge that perhaps they weren't the only people he had hurt. Rachel's disgust the night of the stabbing turned his stomach. Now the memory of Reza's hurt, accusatory look made him feel even worse.

"And by the way, quit calling him 'Apu'. It's not cool," Josh said.

> James blinked. Reza would drive a saint nuts. James was only human.
>
> "It's just a joke," he said.
>
> "How would you feel if Reza called you Blond Bimbo or Kewpie Doll?"
>
> "It's not the same."

"It's exactly the same. They're all stereotypes. 'Apu' is what everybody thinks all East Indians are. Shopkeepers with high voices. You know that his dad is the chief economist at Goldman Sachs?"

> "No."
>
> "Don't you ever talk to him?"
>
> "I can't get him to shut up. If I talk back, it only gets worse."
>
> "Start by calling him by his name. Baby steps."
>
> "I thought we were talking about my relationship with Rachel."
>
> "We are."

Hmmm. Josh's cryptical elliptical comments generally had a point. James had worked with him long enough to know that. Was he saying that James was a racist? If not a racist, a person whose mouth wasn't connected to his brain? A stereotypical white guy?

Reza didn't remind James of Apu, not really. He was a midge, a gnat, some constantly buzzing, circling insect he was always trying to slap at but Reza was so quick, he always got away. Was it possible there was a real person inside the motor-mouthed, meth-addicted package? One could only hope, as his mother liked to say.

"Reza has terrible ADHD."

"Half the kids in Malibu are on Adderall. Why isn't he?"

"He's on Adderall."

"And this is what he's like on drugs? What, is he a ping-pong ball without them?"

It was Josh's turn to roll his eyes. The whites were startling in his polished teak face. "Just cut him some slack is all I'm saying. He doesn't act this way to piss you off. He can't help it."

"Why not help me out and give me a new roommate?"

> "Therapy doesn't work that way. Maybe Reza has something to teach you."

"Besides 'thou shalt not kill'?"

Josh looked at him for a long time and it didn't take a rocket scientist to see that he wasn't liking what he saw. "Grow up, James. It's past time"

Fine, he thought, deep-six 'Apu' and upvote' shit for brains.' If Reza woke up screaming again tonight, he was going to put a sock in his mouth. "Why does he have to be so annoying?"

> "Why do you? I don't go around talking like a valley girl to you because you piss me off."
>
> James said stiffly, "I don't valley speak."

"Like... absolutely, dude. Cowabunga." Josh sighed. "You're a typical white male of privilege. Good hearted in a lot of ways but also clueless about people who are different than you. Sure, Reza has annoying qualities. It's not OK to treat him as subhuman."

James thought bitterly that Josh was being patently unfair. He knew Reza was a human being but humanity was far down on his own agenda. All he was trying to do was get through the day in a morass of shame and self-loathing.

> "Be nice to him once a day. You might be surprised at his reaction." 

He'd die of shock, was James' first thought as he shut the office door behind him. His second thought: or maybe I would.

Thus in small steps do we all make progress toward opening our hearts and letting the other in. Not that James learned this then. Decades later, James will manage a young dark-skinned developer named Riyad who will remind him of Reza. Riyadh is from Bangladesh, he's Hindi, not Muslim like Reza. James will have grown up enough to know the difference which wasn't the case during treatment. He will ask one day, apropos of nothing, what Riyadh's name means.

When the slight South Asian man with the same golden-brown coloring as Reza tells him "contentment," something will strike a chord. Hell be amazed when he looks up the name and sees that both Reza and Riyadh are from the same word root and share the same meaning. He has no idea whether Reza ever reached contentment. He wished he'd had the presence of mind to ask him the meaning of his name back then, but since he didn't, he asks Riyadh about his family and the village he comes from and he remembers and addresses Riyadh by name every time they meet.

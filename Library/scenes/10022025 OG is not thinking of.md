10022025 OG is not thinking of

Nope, nada, nix, not, never, none, can't, won't, wouldn't, shouldn't, don't need to think about anything but what's right here, which is why Old Girl (self-named), now OG (shortened), without a last names (lost), is holding one index finger to the inside of the glass on a large patch of ice.

Nope, nada, nix, never, nothing, not thinking of anything but the feel of one index finger that Old Girl (self-named until everybody started calling her OG) , is holding to the ice that's formed on the inside of the glass at the rickety residential psychiatric treatment center called Inner Horizons. The ice on the inside of the window is courtesy or minus double-digit cold outside and a wheezing furnace inside Healing House, the updated ranch house that housed a dozen Young Adults ( 18-21) more than ten rural miles (or as the locals like to say, as the crow flies) to Coeur D'Alene, Idaho. The deep freeze that dropped to -33 came after 3 weeks of storms that made walking around the block a migraine-level activity.

OG and 11 other Young Adults (18-21) are locked up for psychiatric care at a treatment facility that doesn't care how you are treated as long as somebody can pay the astronomical fees.

Nope, nada, nix, nary, never, not, in particular not thinking was OG[']{dir="rtl"}s mantra when she pressed her index finger into the ice now forming on the inside of the glass at Healing House. This was in response to the

Nope, nada, nix, never, none, can't won't, wouldn't, shouldn't, don't need to think about anything but what's right here, which is Old Girl's (self-named) index finger pressed and now freezing against the ice that's formed on the inside of the pane at Healing House.

OG (self-shortened) with no last name (not used at the Program for reasons like witness protection) had existed at Inner Horizons for three long years. , the psychiatric treatment center that was trying it's damndest to teach her not to think about the senior citizen who mistook his gas pedal for the brake, not wondering how he ran into the back of the van with Mom and Dad and Gabe, her four-year-old brother, and pushed them through the barrier onto a train track, not contemplating the unfairness of her whole family taken from her by Amtrak's Starlight Express that barreled through and smashed them broadside and crushed them into greasy molecules of blood and bone and gristle, the real things she is not thinking about because it is too painful to remember.

... she is trying so hard not to think about, like the senior citizen who mistook his gas pedal for a brake, like his 1973 Cadillac, the one with the cow-catcher grill that smashed into the van holding r Mom and Dad and Gabe her four-year-old brother, and smushed them into greasy molecules of blood, guts and gore. No thinking, she told herself 70 times a day, wa so much better than remembering.

Nope, nada, nix, never, nothing, can't, won't, wouldn't, shouldn't, not thinking of anything but pressing an index finger to the ice forming on the inside of the pane in response to the deep freeze that broke all the cold records for Coeur D;Alene Idaho, after a record number of storms.

All her peers at Inner Horizons were hustling into the living room of Healing House. All twelve Young Adults (18-21) were pushing and jostling through broad double doors to avoid getting a red card for being late to 9 AM Process Group. OG had come early to be in her preferred position on the outside of the perimeter of couches so she could stare out at the never-varying view of snow-mounded Ponderosas that ringed the snow clumped yard around a bungalow with two snow-humped dorm wings with rows of icicles that slobbered from the eaves like filed teeth. OG colonized the baby-shit yellow ottoman, not because she liked the color --- you know, baby-shit and mustard being indistinguishable no matter what the designers told you; the ottoman had the small mercy of being perpetually pushed a little ways beyond the perimeter of four long-suffering, coaches that had been had more disgusting things, physical and moral, vomited upon them than most of the therapists who'd had years of experience with both the hideous and heinous so they were inured to them.

Process Group was the weekly ritual and the corner stone of Inner Horizons therapeutic program which believed that no matter what stage of the "personal growth journey" patients were on, everyone benefits for accounting for their sins and continuing to discuss them ad nauseum. . Whether you lived at Healing House for twelve Young Adults (18-21) ten miles outside of town or bedded with Adolescents (14-17) at "Youth Seeker" cottage or matriculated with the old dues --- some were already balding--- at an updated ranch house called Senior Searcher (22-30), nothing excused you from Process Group.

OG was new to Healing House, having just turned 18 a week ago on January 18. A far as she could tell from her vast experience in Adolescents, the difference between 18-21 and 14-17 was either regression to infant or a lack of progress beyond it.

Why else would 19-year old James, the bond surfer dude from Malibu leap like a hurdler on a track over the back of Big Bertha, the ugly, overstuffed flowered couch in order not to be late? James flopped next to Lydia, one of the less popular cutters, and also a sex mania who gave James blow job in closets and corners and nooks that made OG haver to yell "clear" every time she came around a corner for self protection.

"DONNNNNNGGGGGGGG!" Darlene, Senior Therapist on Duty today, range her personal yoga gong to start the session. The deep-belled brass bowl reverberated in the bone-dry Idaho air like a dirge, which, most that OG allowed herself to think of it) was appropriate for what was to come. There was a new girl (i.e. fresh meat) for the jaded denizens of Healing House --- six boys six girls, all sick of everybody else because all their dumb-shit doing, whatever deviltry or dastardly details of their cruelty and banality and pettiness, had all been dissected into smaller and smaller parts so if you lived here longer than a month, you felt like you got the gore and gristle and blood all over you like a fine pink and shameful mist.

OG was trying very hard not to think about Rachel's recitation about her family because if Rachel had a family, all OG would think was the one that she had lost when a senior citizen who couldn't tell his gas pedal from the brake had rear ended their van and pushed the vehicle onto the train tracks where the Amtrak Western Starlight atomized them into molecules so fine they had to now be floating up in the void overhead leaving behind a fine red mist of gore and guts and blood that settled into the upholstery and the dash panel and all the crevices of the van she's been riding to school in since she was a kindergartner. Her aunt took her to see the van crushed like a soda can under a giant's heel and what was impossible not to remember was the smell of biohazard ooze that turned their formerly gray upholstery into a disgustingly personal pink.

Every crevice, every bit of upholstery, even the headrests had turned a revolting biological pink when the trim package had been gray in real life ie.e life before the crash that wiped out everybody she would ever love.

One of the only good things about YA, besides her single room, was the tea caddy with a ton of non-caffeinated teas and all the hot water you wanted.

Now that the Program admitted in writing that OG was a YOUNG ADULT, they provided hot water plus a bunch of tea, all none-caffeinated. It was true that if she swallowed another mouthful of chamomile tea, she would purposely create a bigger vomit stain on Big Bertha--- but now that OG was just as adult as her peers, she had saved up weeks of her \$5 a month "allowance" and bought a stash of Starbucks Vias that she died with an old tea bsg carried with her everywhere for display purposes only.

While OG waited around for everybody to show up for Processing, she drank her adulterated tea and had a good laugh when the new girl, Rachel, stumbled into the living room all bleary-eyed and sleep deprived like all the newbies would couldn't sleep at the start of their incarceration at Inner Horizon when they realized they'd be locked up in perpetuity at a psychiatric treatment center that didn't care whether it treated you or not, as long as you could pay their astronomical fees. The look on the new girl's face when she asked for coffee and Gretchen looked her in the eye and said, "only senior residents who've already had their growth have caffeine privileges."

While she was waiting around for everybody to show for Process Group, she had a good laugh at the new girl Rachel who stumbled in bleary and sleep-deprived, like every newbie who lost sleep at the start of the Program when they realized they were locked up in perpetuity at a psychiatric treatment center in bumfuck rural Idaho where no one cared how lonely or homesick or devastated you were as long as someone paid the astronomical fees. Rachel, a long-limbed black girl who looked young to be a Young Adult, asked for coffee, Gretchen, the evil nutritionist sniffed. "Caffeine isn't allowed for Young Adults. Only Senior Residents. You're still growing."

Rachel, long-limbed, and dark skinned, was a novelty at mostly white Inner Horizons, except for Reza, the room mate James couldn't stand. It had nothing to do with the fact that he Reza as a SE Asian brown-skinned dweeb; he was also motormouth and a meth maker who blew up his family's pool house on his first attempt at chemistry for fun and profit.

Rachel stumbled in at breakfast and asked Gretchen for coffee and Gretchen snakily pointed her to the tea caddy with exactly one caffeinated tea and said, "Coffee is bad for growing bones. We only serve tea."

OG swore she could see the black girl's sad eyes fill with tears at the thought of life without coffee and felt stirred to offer her a personal Via but didn't. There's plenty to cry about here, girl. Coffee is the least of your losses a place that believes "processing" is how you get through, past, over and around the stuff in life that really ought to extinguish you.

Not thinking of extinguishing little Gabe, not thinking of crushing his four-year-oldn does and his bright yellow curls or his high pitched laugh, except not thinking about it was not working so well today, so she was for once thankful when Darlene --- serious, dour, unsmiling, humorless, dorky and not a bad therapist --- Darlene range the stupid yoga gong with a fierce clout to the brass bell of the bowl to call in the early and the lates and the ones down the hall who were yelling, "I'm coming, I'm coming" like James, the athletic basketball player and surfer, who flew over Big Bertha, the couch with it back to the entry way like a champion hurdler and settled into cushions against his blow-job partner Lydia while the gggggg-gongggggg wa still reverberating to silence.

A dozen Young Adults lived at Healing House --- six males, six females --- housed in separate wings with a gigantic firedoor at each end, the equivalent of steel condoms. If you got caught in the wing of the opposite sex, there was hell and multiple red cards to pay. She wasn't gay but assuming she was, it was possible you were given a free pass unless you snuck out at night and then they put a padlock on your door.

OG had spent 2.5 years in Adolescents; she'd only been in Young Adults at Healing House for three weeks. If there had been a SIDS ward, she'd have signed up for it but really, there was no difference between any of the age categories. It was Infants all the way down, the majority stuck in the Terrible Twos.

Witness: James, the Malibu surfer, after his tremendous leap over Big Bertha that shook the house like an earthquake, was now arguing heatedly with Reza, his roommate. Reza was forbidden to sit on the same couch with him because James had to smell his stinky feet all night and listen to his nonstop talking all morning and THAT WAS OUTSIDE OF ENOUGH!

The decibel range prompted Darlene to calmly hand James a yellow card, which was a warning ( the equivalent of a tap on his wrist) unless he got four yellows in one day which automatically earned a red card for Detention. They were already locked up, 24-hours a day so you would have thought Detention would be superfluous until OG swore off after experiencing four blank walls, not a book or pencil or paper in sight, and nothing to hurt yourself with except thinking about all the things she didn't want to think about except planning her own death.

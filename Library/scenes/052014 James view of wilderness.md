052014 James view of wilderness

The wilderness felt impersonal like a refrigerator you left things in to stay cold. Inert and coldly impassive.

It pressed in on him making him feel small and inconsequential.

There was a great silent mass of white and blue-black trees. Inside James felt small. Shame shriveled his view of himself and he couldn't remember what it was like to think of himself as over six feet tall.

He liked knowing that he was a pebble or a dirt speck, like a small part of the film of grime that built up on the side of the roadways where snow piled up above the roof of the van.

Gray-white up-close, white-blue in the distance, till it reached a shiny diamond white in the vast distance that stretched all the way to the sky.

James is always cold. You grow up in Malibu and shorts and flip-flops are all you wear to armor yourself against the day. Idaho requires a full body suit of flannel and wool and a two-inch layer of down. Sometimes he feels so insulated, he's not even sure he's in there in all that covering except that he always feels like shivering.

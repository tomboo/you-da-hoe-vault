121118 OG likes doctor hazey in new opening

She liked Dr. Hazey, although like everyone in the Program, she thought he was certifiable. He liked to remind her that she was his only patient, as if that was something to be proud of. Actually, what he said was, "You're my one and only" which sounded vaguely creepy except Dr. Hazey wasn't the least bit sexy or even in his body, he was just terminally addled. Margaret always said the founder of the Program couldn't find his way out of a paper bag and OG herself had experienced his habit of starting a sentence and forgetting he was supposed to end it.

When she asked him why she was the lucky one to have him as her therapist, he answered, "Too busy." It made no sense whatsoever, until she figured out that he wasn't answering "why her?" and instead, was answering, "why not others?"

He was genuinely kind to her. He occasionally surprised her with something astute like the time he told her that true grief never ended, it just lost its sharp edge over time. If she didn't feel like talking, he didn't hector her. He just let her lie on the sofa and watch the clouds high above Couer d'Alene Lake.

... like the time he told her that drowning only looked easy and that the terror of hypoxia would be horrible, even if short, and that jumping from a high building or crashing an airplane was the easiest of all because death was generally instantaneous. Dr. Hazey wasn't one to hush up talk of killing oneself, like Uncle David and Aunt Pegg. Death was part of life, even the one you chose for yourself. His job was to make her want to live and it wouldn't happen immediately. It might not happen at all. But they would try and when she got tired of trying, they would try something different. He seemed happy enough to talk about asphyxia and hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning and anything she had questions about and pretty much, that's how they spent their first year together until she felt the Hello Kitty phase of suicide-lite attempts had been burned out of her by superior, scientific knowledge. Dr. Hazey was a medical doctor as well a psychiatrist, so he did know a lot about the body if you asked the right questions. He didn't try to dissuade her from being curious: you might want to become a doctor yourself, he told her, if you can live through med school. That will kill you for sure and then you'll really want to die because you're drowning in debt. Maybe he was joking. Maybe not.

If she'd only had all this knowledge in the Hello Kitty phase of her first abortive attempts, she'd already be dead. End of story.

Unfortunately, she was still in the middle of her own drama, stuck in a jury by her peers.

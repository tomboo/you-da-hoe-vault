Rachel Befriends Etsy

Grope was full of complaints and stories about the night before. The boys were mad they didn\'t get to join in the slumber party.

Etsy had a mild case of frost bite on her foot because she\'d gone off to the ancient backyard swing set and sat there too long in wet tennis shoes. Charleen had to put her in a foot bath to warm up her frozen pinkie and the \"slumber party\" good mood had been interrupted by her yowls \"Hot! Hot!\" She kept yowling. \"It feels like pins and needles.\"

Rachel felt sorry for the big doughy girl. She was catatonic, practically, when she\'d arrived but the frost bite had woken her up to a world of pain. Rachel got up and moved her Thermarest and sleeping bag on the other side of her.

\"Want the rest of my cocoa?\" Rachel offered a mostly full cup to Etsy, who took it automatically as if she wasn\'t used to making decisions of her on her own.

Etsy grunted- maybe that was her version of thank you- but the cocoa seemed to distract her from the feeling coming back into her toes.

\"How come you\'re being nice to me?\" Etsy said. \"Do you want to have sex?\"

Rachel blinked. Where had that come from. Etsy wore cowboy printed pajamas that gapped over her big middle. Her expression was bland, like she was used to accepting somebody handed her. The thought of that kind of misery, day in and day out, for all of Etsy\'s past life and her future made Rachel\'s grief at losing her photo album pale in comparison.

\"No,\" Rachel said. \"I just want to be friends.\"

The simple girl flashed a simple smile. All joy. No distraction of thought or worry about Rachel\'s intentions or wonderment at this unexpected offer in a night of terror.

\"I\'m Etsy,\" She held out a meaty hand.

\"I know. I\'m Rachel. I\'m new.\"

Etsy\'s eyes clouded with the difficulty of a thought. \" Are you the flopper?\"

\"The flopper?\"

\"Reza\'s my bestie, \" she said. \"We came the same day a long time ago.\" She lowered her man-deep voice. \"He was crying and I said I\'d be his friend.\"

Reza had zinged of the fire around in the excitement like a bedeviled imp. He talks to the firefighters a mile a minute in the wildest outfit. Some kind of Arab-inspired turban and one of the girl\'s short puffy ski coats above his bare legs, before Charleen had made him put a car blanket around his waist.

\"Did Reza say I was a flopper?\" Rachel asked.

\"Like a fish,\" Etsy said.

\"I was in Isolation. Missed it.\"

Etsy\'s matter of fact summing up of Rachel\'s fit, another in a lifetime of shaming moments, struck her as funny. She\'d never thought of herself as entertaining or as an object of interest.

\"I\'ll wake you up if I think I\'m going to have one. You\'ll have a front row seat.\"

Etsy save her another snaggle-toothed smile. \"A fish friend,\" she said, some what enigmatically, before she zipped her sleeping bag closed and gave her pillow a couple vicious punches like she was kneading bread.

After that Rachel listened to the sound of Etsy\'s breathing as it evened out. All around her the rest of the girls in the program ceased chattering and drifted off to sleep.

The adrenalin of being woken out of a sound sleep to escape a fire took a long time to work its way out of her body, even though she felt exhausted and empty.

Everybody thought she was upset at losing her family pictures. Mom serving the xmas turkey. Dad holding her over his arm as a baby like a football with a bald torpedo like head. She was sorry she\'d lost those kinds of photos, of course. Her junior prom before she knew she was pregnant. Her 440 race where she leaned across the finish line at State.

It was the small black and white from radiology. A fuzzy image. More like a silhouette without features but an unmistakable shape. Around melon-shaped head hunched over. A little fist held up to the mouth. It was the only picture she was ever going to have of the lost baby. Sucking its thumbs.

How many times could you lose something? She\'d lost Cal, her boyfriend who didn\'t want anything to do with her when she told him the news. She\'d lost her parents when their faces shuttered and they stopped meeting her eye. Then the coup de grace. Se lost the actual baby, the strangely comforting presence in her belly that she ran with and swam with and held her hand over when she felt its champagne bubble fizz at first, then stronger and occasionally jolting kicks that bumped out her skin. The ultrasounds photo as grainy and hard to make out, was the sole piece of proof she had that a baby existed somewhere on this earth without her.

Sleep crept up on her like a thief in the night. Even though she was surrounded by 20 sleeping bodies, with their sighs and rhythmic breaths, she felt a familiar emptiness until even the memory of what she had lost was taken away from her by darkness.

**Atl**: Just when she thought she had a hold of something it was stolen by darkness.

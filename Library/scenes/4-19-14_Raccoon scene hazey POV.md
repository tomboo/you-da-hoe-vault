041914 Raccoon scene multiple POVs

Hazey had no idea who the boy was when he pulled back the white sheet. Late teens? Maybe early twenties, white faced, slightly acne-spotted with a sparse beard and expensive orthodontic-straightened teeth. He might have been any one of a thousand patients treated at Inner Journeys over the past twenty years.

\"He\'s new,\" Margaret says.

\"Not anymore,\" Hazey says.

\"Call the coroner,\" one of the medics says. \"Time of death, 2:04 pm.\"

\"There\'s a live one over there,\" Hazey gestured to the head of the review committee now attempting to sit up on the the snow. \"Might be a head injury.\"

\"Not this guy,\" the medic says. \"His heart stopped.\"

Aiming a hopeful look toward the doctor who was now being helped to his feet by the two female reviewers, Hazey wondered how long it would take for a bleeder to fill his cranium.

\"Fucking raccoons,\" Margaret said to Hazey as they both surveyed the raccoon-induced mayhem on the snow. Bins canted over in the wooden frame. Lids overturned like flying saucers abandoned by aliens. There was not a beady black masked bandit in sight but Hazey thought he could feel the feral creatures' gaze on them from the bushes.

\" I got the one but the rest of 'em scattered before I could get off another round.\"

A neon orange star shape splattered the front of the cedar rack. In the back of the yard, neon green bloomed on the flat red fence like a sea anemone far from home.

By the entry, the paint gun stood upright like a sentinel waiting for another skirmish in a never-ending war.

Hazey has done everything humanly possible to prepare for the certification review board.

Staff: prepped, processed and protocolled.

Rules and regulations: memorized by every employee on pain of dismemberment.

Facility: carpets cleaned, walls scrubbed, new primer and paint, dry wall where needed, than touched up with fresh latex.

Dietetics: new color menus, printed calorie counts, optimal meal plans for vegetarians, vegans the gluten intolerant.

Kids: bribed and brow beaten to behave in exchange for all the pizza they can eat, a D.J. who made a promise to spin every rap hate song on the parental discretion list.

He\'d thought of everything except the goddamn raccoons.

\"What\'s wrong with them?\" Josh said. They seemed to be multiplying before his eyes. At first it was just the one raccoon with a grapefruit hat. Now there were half a dozen of the masked bandits milling among coffee grounds and rotting vegetables.

\"They\'re just hungry,\" Margaret said. \"It\'s been a hard winter.\"

He watched one of the bigger ones work a snout under the rim of the lid and in a few seconds, it managed to flip the lid off its seal and knock it askew. Two smaller ones snuffled and ran past into the dark hole and minutes later, one emerged with an apple core in its mouth.

\"They\'re cute,\" Josh said.

\"The director doesn\'t think so,\" she said. \" They\'re a damn nuisance.\"

Two raccoons emerged tugging on the same beef bone and one of them went ass over teakettle with a startled yelp.

How does it come out that Margaret buys lowball neon paint.

Everything done at Healing House was decided by committee. Hazey learned early on the \"owning\" a business was just a euphemism for being owned by the bank who owned the mortgaged and everyone who worked there and the parents who owned them all.

If Hazey had to own up to it, to his biggest learning in owning a business it was that ownership was really a euphemism for being owned by all the employees, by the bank who held the title to his mortgage like a strangle hold, to the certification process you had to pass to the parents whom in psycho-speak you had to own up to. Every time he saw a "family owned"sign he had an insane urge to erase the "n" so that the sign read \"ow-ed.\"

For once, Hazey didn\'t take it to the exec committee (Hazey thought of them as the Hex committee) and he quietly asked Margaret to go out and buy a paint ball gun.

You couldn\'t have a Glock or AK47, which is what he really wanted, around kids with psychiatric issues because they'd end up offing everybody in sight. Hazey had once made the mistake of taking the Healing House crew to Paint Ball Alley as an outing and he still bore the scars and bruises of about a thousand rounds all turned against him by the little shits. So he knew the suckers hurts-- the one he took in the face nearly put out his eyes--so he figured the raccoons would be maimed or injured, if not killed by a direct hit.

Margaret, who\'d never played paintball in her life saw a 2 for-one- glow-in-the-dark paint sale at K-Mart which is how Healing House ended up with two cases of paint cartridges in the basement. It was a surprise to everybody when they realized they got a veritable rainbow of Day-Glo colors that were so bright they were nuclear reactive. Lady Gaga would have been thrilled.

Need to write the fire scene where two raccoons end up in the trees like radioactive starbursts.

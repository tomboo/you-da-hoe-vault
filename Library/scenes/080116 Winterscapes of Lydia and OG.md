080116 Winterscapes of Lydia and OG

She could make out the dim purple-white mass of a large peak. The horizon line faintly yellowed in the gleam of the intermittent moon. The living trees looked like black triangles next to the pale lavender-colored streaks of snags and dead trunks.

In the Eastern sky, the moon rose. A polished coin tossed against a blue-black sky. Its light erased the pinpricks of stars close to it but farther away, distant from its gray and dirty brightness, the stars winked in the darkness like metallic flecks of blue, lavender, yellow and red.

What surprised her was that the winter world was far from black-and-white. Dim lavender shadows. A blue-black sky. A patch of snow drift brushed by the cold silver light of the moon. The stars seemed to wink and wheel amid the slow moving clouds. Where the moon hung in the east, a sulfur yellow light escaped the dark purple and gray cloud cover. Stars that were billions of light years away winked red, or yellow or green in a constant blinking pattern. It reminded her of the pointillist painting Grandpa donated to the Detroit Art Museum which used to hang in their dining room in Grosse Point. It looked whole and coherent landscape if you were far away and strangely pulsing and nonhuman when you got up close.

The stars were spilled diamonds.

The stars were tiny metallic flakes against a blue-black sky.

The stars blinked in a radiographic display of cold diodes.

The stars were arctic frost chips unlike the swirling gas giants they were supposed to be.

The stars pricked the night sky full of holes.

The stars winked and blinked, a velvet tapestry of pinpricks.

The starlight was hazy. A fine netting softened its glow as light leaked through from a billion miles away.

Sound was muffled. The snow made a three feet deep cloud of insulation.

In the cold, her boots squeaked and crunched like metal.

In warmer temperatures, the snow muffled sound but tonight, the cold amplified Old Girl's footsteps. It sounded like she was walking on metal: scrunch, creak, a thump with each footfall. It would be hard to sneak up on someone on a night as cold as this one. It would be just her luck to need to be heard when there was no one around to listen.

As she trudged along, she thought about the starlight that had started out from a distant galaxy about the time of the dinosaurs. If you expected to see something better by the time you got here, too bad.

**Difference between Lydia and OG?**

Lydia walks the road around Hayden Lake around 9 pm to midnight. Old Girl wakes up about the same time that Lydia is freezing to death.

Lydia feels locked down, closed off. She can expel what she doesn't want to hold in but she can't leave it in long enough to process it and let it do its work.

Lydia is hollow. The cold carves pieces out of her. First her feet go numb in the ridiculously oversized boots, then her hands quit working. Inside, she feels herself emptying out, half imagining that if she looked behind her as she walked, she would see a dark trail. There would be nothing standing where her body ought to be.

Instinctively she looks back but she sees exactly the same view behind her as what's ahead of her. A violet- white road where the shadowy trees on either side have darkened to purple-black.

Old Girl depresses the door handle. She holds it down to suppress the snick of the lock. Once out beyond the shadow of the Ponderosas that ring Healing Hous's yard, stars cast a silver swash of light against a cut-velvet sky.

She inhales a first taste of freedom. It fills her lungs with a shock of dry, cold air. Her footsteps crunch and squeak in the cold. She's afraid that the noise will alert someone to her escape until she's half a mile beyond Healing House and understans she's gone beyond their supervision forever.

**OG chart**

Inhales the cold and ingests the first shock of freedom which is dry and cold.

The stars are so bright in the cut-velvet sky that they fill her with a sense of wonder. Who knew it was so beautiful at the deadest time of night?

The crunch and metallic squeak of footsteps reassures her that she's fully alive and present. She doesn't feel alone or lonely. It's enough to be on her own in the brightly lit road with a gold moon that allows her to see every pock and dent in the snow.

A flurry of snow dumps down from the bottle-brush branches of a lodgepole pine. Gravity letting go. She catches a flake on her tongue and lets it melt, taking in its whisper of moisture like an impersonal kiss.

**Lydia chart**

\--Hollow.

\--Emptying out, leaving a dark trail behind her like she's an unraveling thread that will eventually run out.

\--Stars look like pinpricks in a black cloth. The impression she has is that milky light is leaking out of its black covering. Always before, she had thought of Idaho's stars---brighter than any stars you could see in light-polluted Detroit---were pushing infinite light at her from a great distance. Now she feels the opposite. Light is leaking from its source and soon, blackness will take over.

\--Looking down at the dark seepage running down the inside of her legs, she wonders if her insides are leaking out of her and at some point will join with or strengthen the black covering of sky which is filling in a million pinpricks.

\--When a cloud drifts over the moon, she feels a momentary optimism that the cloud cover will fill up the sieve of the night. But soon, the clouds move across the moon and the darkness gets more absolute.

Lydia tries to follow the ruts made by Jed's truck, thinking it will be easier to walk in the space left by the wheels, but soon realizes this is a mistake. She skates on the ice under the thin snow covering and falls painfully on one bare knee. It takes her quite a while to ease over onto her side and scrabble up onto both legs. She feels like she's a thousand years old, an old woman on her last legs, trying to make her way on a ground that is pitted and iced over like an abandoned ice rink.

At first, Lydia tried to follow in the ruts left by Jed's truck wheels but that's a mistake. One foot skated out from underneath her and sent her sprawling to her hands and knees. It felt like she'd landed on her kneecap on a sharp rock. When she managed to wobble to her feet, her knee looked dark and sticky in the uncertain light.

After several more falls on pitted and rutted ice---she stuck to the deeper, clotted ruck of snow along the road's edge. It was harder to make forward progress but at least she had enough traction to stay on her feet.

The treachery of the ice forced her to inch along like an old woman. She held her arms out, body tensed as if expecting the worst. But hadn't the worst already happened at the shooting range? How much worse could it get?

A confused image of landing in front of a shot-out TV, her eyes at the level of the broken-out screen. Jed was kicking her in the back while her head repeatedly banged the plastic woodgrain console. Panasonic. Life is better in living color.

A remembered jolt. Was that what messed up her hearing? He back-handed her on her ear and she tripped over the door to a half-buried oven. Fucking or punching. All the same hurt. At first, she tried to stay upright and hold her hands in front of her face but soon, she gave up and curled on the ground like a grub, forcing him to pick her up and hold her to hit her. She'd had Survival Training where she learned to roll up in a ball and to protect her neck in case of a bear attack. A bear would have been preferable to Jed, high on Ecstasy and amphetamines that gave his punching arm the stamina and repetitive blows of an Energizer Punch Bunny.

She walked on and on but after a while, it didn't seem that she was getting anywhere. The road was a treadmill passing the same thing. Black triangular trees with white overloaded branches. Monotonous in their sameness. Occasionally, a whumpf of snow would jolt her out of her lethargy. The snowy load would get too heavy and when gravity took over, the crash to the ground set up a mini-snow-storm that made her jump.

The first time it happened, she felt a leap of fear. Had Jed come back to finish it? Soon, though, as it happened multiple times, even a snow dump that dusted her head and shoulders with chunks of ice snow barely got her to turn her head.

She had no idea how far or how long she'd been walking since Frankie shoved his boots at her and told her to keep going. Time had lost all meaning. It was beginning to feel pointless to put one foot in front of the other. Her hands had lost all feeling. She couldn't feel her nose or her lips. Even her thoughts seemed to be numbing and slowing like the cold outside was working its way inside her body.

As Lydia plodded along, she had the oddest feeling that she was existing in two planes of time. She was at once hiking endless miles around the backside of Hayden Lake on a dim snowy road while she was also hiking up and down the trails of most of the national parks of the western United States.

The summer she turned 15, someone---she couldn't remember whether it was her mother wanting to get her out of her hair or Grandpa Ben thinking she'd enjoy a challenge or maybe it was some well meaning person at the Alliance Francaise, like the principal who believed that fresh air solved every problem. One of these people decided to send her on a hiking tour of the best outdoor experiences in the United States that money and an endless supply of college-age camp counselors could buy. It was billed as a "greatest hits" of America's National Parks: Yellowstone, Gran Targhee and the Tetons, Sequoia National Forest with its mammoth ghost trees, Rainier National Park, the Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana, Glacier Park, Banff and Lake Louise,in Canada and finally, the ground finale in the Pasayten Wilderness of the North Cascades where it rained every day for two weeks.

The guide who led the trip, among a pack of young, uber-educated, eternally cheerful college counselors, was a horse-faced graduate level botanist bee expert named Grace. Grace took Lydia under her wing because no one else would.

Lydia had just scraped onto the tour under the age cut off. You were supposed to be at least 15 but because her 15^th^ birthday was in August, at the very end of the trip, they made an exception for her. The age exception was a surefire way to exclude Lydia from the company of the majority of the other campers who were mostly 16 or 17. Nobody, including the camp counselors, wanted to hang with a stick-thin, motor-mouth fourteen-year-old with low self-esteem which is how Lydia ended up trotting up and down 600 miles of high subalpine trails over ten weeks at Gracie's heels learning about high country flora and fauna.

The first two weeks of break-in were god awful but after the first 90 miles, the kids acquired the speed and stamina of mountain goats. Lydia went from hating every moment and everyone around her to loving every minute of every day and finally, falling deeply in love with Gracie.

To keep Lydia's mind busy, while forcing her to develop her visual skills, Gracie equipped Lydia with her own sketch book and gave her a daily assignment. By the end of the summer, Lydia learned to find, identify, and record all botanical attributes, including the Latin names, of everything from the subvarieties of lupine to 21 varieties of Indian paint brush.

To her endless surprise, she loved cataloguing the endless variety of survival techniques of the high country plants.

Gracie had taken the guiding job so that she could work on her botanical research while getting paid to babysit. ("I put up with you little assholes because I get to be around the most beautiful plants in the world," she was always telling them.) A research paper that was due when she got back to UC Davis was supposed to be accompanied by a survey of all the botanical specimens that grew above 5000 feet of elevation. Compared to Gracie's stubby, pedestrian pencil sketches, Lydia's drawings were minute and delicate with nuance and detail that surprised everyone, including herself. Soon, Lydia took over the identification and drawing tasks while Gracie worked on her hypothesese and conclusions.

Lydia had never been needed. She was used to being superfluous to her mother who shuttled her off to nannies or au pairs when she was little and later on, to expensive private schools. To be told what she was drawing was beautiful, that her eye for design and detail was good, that what she was doing was useful, shocked her. And when Gracie told her she was depending on her help, she fell in love. At the end of the summer, she packed up the sketch book with its studies of the lily of Parnassus, pearly everlasting, pasque flowers and Jacob's ladder.

She was thinking of all the delicate and wildly diverse plants of the high country that were now buried under snow. In the brutally short growing season---heightened by the pressure of high elevation, extreme winds, and cold, the plants shot up in a frenzy of fragile revolt. Indian paintbrush, lupine, shooting stars, glacier lilies, avalanche lilies mouse-on-a-stick, mats of clover, heart leaf arnica, purple asters, bear grass, popcorn plants, spreading phlox, red and pink and white heather, gillia gentian, monks hood, camas with its deadly bulbs. If she could keep listing all the flowers and plants she had drawn, she could keep placing one foot in front of her. Thimble berry, salmon berry, wild strawberries, alpine raspberry, choke cherry, bitter brush, lady fern, sword fern, maiden hair ferns and deer fern.

The names were stored somewhere deep in her brain. The locked drawer that held them must have been shaken loose by Jed's beating. Now that the punching and sex was over, she had the feeling that there was so little left of her, she wasn't even sure she was still the same person. The plant list kept her feet on the never-ending ribbon of road that stretched on with no end.

Every plant had a creative strategy for surviving their harsh and unforgiving world. Some shot their stalks up high and fast toward the brief face of the son. Others spread low and sucked the nutrients out of rocks and scrags and scree. The heathers fought each other for narrow ecological niches: red heather had larger, low-to-the-ground foliage and more red-pink blooms than its competitor, white heather which was closer-to-the-ground, more slender with fewer creamy white bells.

She knew where the sketch book was, even with her shaken brain pan. It was wrapped at the bottom of her summer clothes trunk where she'd hid it after the fire at Healing House. Looking at the pages, she could barely remember the almost-15-year-old she had been, full of hope and usefulness that summer, face turned toward the light for the briefest time.

It was when she ran out of flower names that she let herself sink to her knees in the snow. It felt so good to stop walking. Nothing moved in the stillness. A faint rushing throb in the pines. The windy sound of rushing water in the creek that paralleled the road. A violin rub of a bare tree branch brushing a tree trunk made an other-worldly sound that was part human and part animal moan.

She curled up on her side, bare knees tucked up to her chest in the zipped up jacket like she'd been foreshortened into a baby. The soft snow under her felt oddly warm in contrast to the deep blue cold she could feel creeping up from the frozen ground into her bones.

She was seeing glacier lilies, so vibrantly yellow and sunny during their short lives before they were buried under snow for the rest of the year. What color would she be when the dark night of winter came to an end? Whose face would she see looking down into her own when she opened her eyes to the sun?

032119 Imitation sentence James apology

Changing places in the room felt weird. James had lived in the same walls with Reza for more than a year. A year of being locked up in Idaho -- away from his sister and his parents and his friends -- locked up in rural Idaho in Coeur D'Alene. In Coeur D'Alene, he lived with a roommate for the first time---that was pretty weird \-- in a weird, narrow room with a low, sloping ceiling he kept cracking his head on. It had one skinny window that was locked on the outside. The sash rose six inches and no more. James's stuff had shoved Reza into the corner.

His brown bean bag chair slopped into Reza's desk like a space-eating amoeba. His extra-large exercise ball bumped against the desk legs. His mattress, extra-long to fit his tall frame, pushed Reza's mattress up against the wall. His hand weights, towels, toiletries, and books took up all the book shelf. The only thing James hadn't colonized was Reza's saffron-colored sheets. That funk was all Reza.

When had he starting colonizing Reza's space? James had no idea. And no idea why that realization made him even more depressed. He let the air out of the exercise ball and watched the husk of plastic crumple and sigh to the floor. He started to put it into Reza's trash but stopped and stuffed it into his own. Baby steps.

061714 Suicide Calculations Old Girl

Outside the window framed by the jagged teeth of icicles, wilderness stretched for miles and miles. White and blue-black trees forever. Sometimes she could feel the cold stillness pulling at her like an open refrigerator but today, the chatter and whine of Process Group distracted her.

She concentrated instead on an icicle dagger that dripped from the gutter halfway to the window sash. If she stood under it for long enough, say on a day when the sun came out, was it sharp enough to impale her through her skull? Or would she have to depend on gravity---the thing weighed five pounds, at least---to knock her senseless. Did anybody else in Idaho depend on suicide calculations to save them from terminal boredom?

Outside the window framed by jagged icicle teeth lay the dead still wilderness. The Kaniksu Forest, it was called. Through the jagged mouth of ice, Old Girl could feel the pull of the endless whiteness like the pull of an open icebox begging a child to crawl in and shut the door.

Usually it calmed her to imagine walking till her feet gave out and let her curl up in the snow to go to sleep but today, the whine and wrangle surrounding her on all sides was distracting. She pulled her attention from the vast still whiteness to the largest, sharpest icicle that dripped from the gutter and was glacially moving to the sash. If the spear let go, would it be heavy enough to impale her thick skull into the gray matter of her brain? Or did she have to pray that gravity would knock her senseless before she froze to death, hidden by the bushes?

She pulled her attention from the vast still dead zone of the Kaniksu Wilderness and concentrated on the largest icicle. A dagger that loomed from the eave and dripped halfway to the sash. Suicide math never failed her. If you stood under it, on a sunnier day than today, for example, how long would you have to wait till it broke off and impaled itself in your skull? Or did you have to pray that it was heavy enough to knock her senseless, so she could freeze to death under the myrtle bush where no one could see her in black hoody and jeans? Or was its gravity enough to just break her neck outright?

There were plenty of cutters and scab pickers and garden variety self-injurers plus bulimics and anorexics by the score but nobody in the program who shared her all-out jones to just get it over with. Old Girl herself couldn't have said why death seemed like her most important life goal. It had always been that way for her. Even before Mom and Dad and her little brother, Gabe got smashed to bloody smears by a senior citizen who couldn't tell the difference between the gas and the brake.

Leia, the anorexic---or she bulimic? Old Girl just knew it involved throwing up---was whining that she'd just gone first yesterday. James, her current squeeze, contradicted her and said he was fucking sick of always going first.

"Language, James." Darlene held up her red pen and pointing to her notebook as if she was giving him a choice about getting a red mark that would take away more privileges. What privileges hadn't already been taken away?

"No way," James said. "It's somebody else's turn to be the goat."

Old Girl focused on the far distance where the black trees shifted from black stubble to a dark blue haze against white.

They whinged and whined and wrangled on in the background. Old Girl focused on the far distant whiteness of the Kuniko Wilderness that stretched as still as death as far as she could see. Usually she could distract herself from all the crap that went on around her by doing suicide math in her head. Like how long would she have to walk into the wilderness before her legs would give out and she could lay down in the snow and let herself sleep? If today's temperature was in the high teens, would she die in four hours? If the temperature fell to zero, could she cut off an hour of teeth chattering and shivering?

Reza screamed, "No! No effin' way!" He already had two warnings; one more and he went to Stable, which was the euphemism they used for a 24-hour "Medical Stabilization" pick-me-up in a Quonsett hut that was even more remote from civilization than Healing House.

The thread of her computations broke.

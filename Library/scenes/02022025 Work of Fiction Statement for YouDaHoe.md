02022025 Work of Fiction Statement for YouDaHoe

Inner Horizons isn't a real place; it's a compilation of a lot of real places that treat troubled adolescents and young adults all over the world. The people in this story are composites of many people. My two kids (the one who lived and the one who didn't) were the inspirations for these much-loved characters but they're made up of many people I know, and of course, parts of me, particularly those most dislike and want to slap silly for causing me to screw up. Everything in this story is made up and told slant, per Emily Dickinson's immortal advice. It's up to the reader to discern what arrives at the truth now that I have done my best to share it with to you.

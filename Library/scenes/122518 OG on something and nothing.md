122518 OG on something and nothing

At that time of life, you know something. Not a lot. You know what you don't want. A blue collar life, working in a retail store selling jewelry, running a till or Go forbid, making change. You think you're going to go to college or maybe collect is just the next logical step like being able to see a cloud limned in light without knowing what's in the center of it.

Nothing is definite. An absence of light. Dark inside and out, not even the relief of a corner or a cranny or a door. Something is foggy. Indefinite and cloudy -- amorphous and indistinct, something not nothing but no way to tell what it is.

Kids at OG's age looked at people living their lives, working, raising families or going to med school or choosing to drive truck and it looked to her like those lives were mapped out with logical stepping stones and distinct paths. But she was in the fog at that stage: unsure, untethered, not knowing whether to stay or to go.

OG was at a turning point but she was conflicted about which way to go. She'd passed the inept and blundering attempts to kill herself and she knew that her next attempt wouldn't be make-believe. She'd gotten the knowledge and wherewithal and maturity to do the dee but now that she was smarted, she wasn't so sure she wanted nothingness so much as something more? But what? She'd been thinking about a one-way trip so long that she was flummoxed by the thought that now that she'd been so far, how the hell was she going to come all the way back. Jesus. Just when she got competent at something, she graduated to something harder which was how to live.

Nothing was so much easier than the indeterminate nature of something. She wouldn't recognize it if came up to bite her.

Stay or go? Live or die? Runaway but to what?

Her biggest desire used to be getting away from the past. Now it was fear of the future. At least the past, in all its horribleness, was past and couldn't come around again. All she had to do in the future is not get attached, not get engaged, not get connected to anything or anybody or any place that couldn't be taken away. It was easier to say no than to make a choice. Easier to decide what she didn't want, would never do, wouldn't let happen, can't abide, would rather die than try it.

OG's first stumbling steps out of the cab

When she took her first step out of the cab, it felt so painful. She felt pins and needles as blood rushed back into her feet and she wondered whether lighting out for the territories was worth all that pain. Should she climb back into the cold cab with a dead man where she felt like she knew her purpose? He'd been adamant about holding her hand. She was supposed to stay with him, that's what he was telling her. She looked back at the bent Ponderosa. The truck whinged suddenly and rolled onto its side. The thrown up snow settled slowly and ineluctably from the disturbed tree branches and all but buried the chassis and the cab with the man in it. The man, whoever he was, was buried in nothingness. He no longer had the power to draw her with him.

She was afraid to go on, she went on. Everyone had to figure it out except for the ones who chose the no. Nothing was easier than something. Something was a round trip, a circular, groping journey where you never knew if you were on the right path which made it tricky to go forward for years. But if you took the no to nothingness, it was one way. Quick. Abrupt. Definitely easier because it was over in an instant. It put an end to the eternal question: am I doing the right thing.

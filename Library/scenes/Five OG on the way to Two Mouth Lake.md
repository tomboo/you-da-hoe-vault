MONDAY WAS OUTDOOR ACTIVITY DAY. People were scurrying around, trying to find their snow gear. Old Girl waited at the front door, wool hat pulled over her ears, gloves in pocket, sweating in puffy blue down. She feIt like a preschooler. Where was the mitten leash that slipped through both arms of the jacket and around her neck?

They were supposed to leave by eleven but by the time everybody found all their gear, it would be closer to eleven-thirty.

It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door of the house where she grew up in Portland, Oregon, while Mom wrestled Gabe into his snowsuit. She was five years older than Gabe, so she could dress herself, while the baby had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding his compact square body between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down to cork his foot into a green boot. Back then, Old Girl thought she should hear a pop when the foot finally slipped in. Did it bloop? Or was it more like a thwock? What's the reverse of a champagne cork sound, she thought with sadness. A thwoop?

She couldn't recall what was Gabe doing during all Mom's pushing and shoving. Gabe was a sunny-tempered dark-haired baby -- not a colicky screamer like her, according to Aunt Peggy. But now her mind was as empty of memories of him as an ice-covered lake.

Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember what Dad smelled like any more. He was a builder and she used to be able to call him up in the smell of fresh-cut wood. Now, when she hauled kindling and split logs to fuel Healing House's wood stove, all she smelled was pitch. Dad was gone, escaped up the chimney. Now he seemed even farther away than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a senior citizen had driven a Cadillac into their back end and a train had crushed all three of them.

The sky was the usual color of cement.

When the van finally hammered north on Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how they said it in Youdaho) everyone was squirrelly with relief. It was a French name from some ancient trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just eleven kids tired of being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the blizzards.

They weren'teven out of the driveway before James and Lydia got a warning for inappropriate touching. Lydia got a demerit and had to stay behind with Margaret in charge of her. She had a hissyfit but Darlene told her to suck it up and live with the consequences. Now James sat next to Bruce, the driver, his wandering hands far removed from Lydia's crotch. Rachel Cathcart slumped against the window next to him. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but they'd made a detour and picked her up at the Kootenai emergency room after she checked out okay. Old Girl got stuck in the far back of the Suburban AKA Barfland.

Barfland felt glacial. Old Girl was relieve that Lydia wasn't stuck in the back with her. Otherwise she would have had to pretend she was interested in how many times Lydia had traded oral sex for candy in the past week. Blowjobs. Just another word for money in Youdaho, Lydia confided last week.

Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House. Endless blue trees. A landscape where nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About three miles was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature kept dropping.

Bruce told them the plan was to make them snowshoe up to a small lake with an outlet and an inlet at both. It fed into the main Pend Oreille lake. The hike was supposed to take a couple hours up; less on the way back. Snow wasn't forecast, but if it dumped, they'd turn around and head back to the van.

The Suburban throbbed with migraine level noise. Old Girl felt as always like she was being assaulted. Two years before, after Peggy and David dumped her, the first thing she understood had been taken away was a quiet place to hear herself think. For the millionth time, Old Girl missed her iPod, which had been confiscated by Margaret the day she came into the Program. Some asshole had broken into the storage locker where contraband was kept---probably Dani, the klepto---and now it was permanently lost.

Old Girl had dark plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she had found on campus to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

010119 Witches hooter

The milk lady says, conversationally, "Boy howdy, you picked a cold morning for your car to break down. It's colder than a witch's hooter."

In steeling herself for the witch's tit, OG nearly misses it. "Excuse me. A hooter?"

"What the witch has got between her legs. Same as you and me."

"Huh. That's a new one."

"Well don't let yours freeze off, a young girl like you. It's use it or lose it, and damn, when you lose it, you'll miss it."

In Idaho you meet all kinds, even sex therapists working double shifts on dairy delivery.

"Excuse me? A hooter?"

"That thing that's between your legs," she explains in the manner of a kind or Confucian teacher. "Witches don't use it and that's why they're so cold."

Between the man in the truck and now this, OG is beginning to believe it's quite a night.

"Do you know any witches?" she asks, her tone tentative.

"Oh, honey, it's just an expression," the milk lady says. "Like use it or lose it. I wish someone had told me when I was your age that hormones die." Her tone is bitter. "Toot your old hooter as much as you want. And remember I told you." She imparts this wisdom as she's pulling off to the side in front of the Golden Arches. OG hears, "Use it or lose..." in the rumble of the door sliding shut.

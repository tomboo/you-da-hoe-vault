072214 OG gets what she wants and is appalled

Death didn't care what either Old Girl or the garbage man wanted, that was clear. It was going to happen to the garbage man and she couldn't do a thing to stop it---was already happening, in fact, when he climbed into his filthy truck and turned from his garbage dump onto the ice of Cavalry Road and skidded his truck into a Ponderosa pine that shoved his engine through his sternum.

For the past half-hour, she had been trying to warm his hand between her palms and she felt right away when his fingers begin to cool. She knew the second his spirit left his body because goose bumps raised the skin on the back of his hand and seconds later, the bumps disappeared like the ghost of something cold had breathed on him on its way past.

Old Girl had been thinking about and talking about and hoping and wishing for death forever. She had made her childish, stupid, asinine suicide plans so many times, she thought she was perfectly prepared for death until it came and hi-jacked the man next to her.

She was so far from wanting to join him she was ashamed.

His breathing changed from labored pants to long, silences between shallow breaths. By the time the pauses lasted longer than the tiny intake of air, she was horribly aware that death wasn't on the seat between them or among the hamburger wrappers and old French-fry packets of his old life. It was already in the man and hauling him away like so much garbage before she was ready.

But wait! Wait! She wanted to call to him. Don't leave me here by myself! She held onto his hand with a death grip and then his jaw opened a last time and stayed open as if he was in mid-speech. She flipped on the overhead cab light and watched his skin go from dusky rose to dull blue until all the color leached away to the uniform gray of old meat.

An hour before, she might have chosen to go to sleep beside his corpse in the freezing cab. Instead, she had a terrible urge to back away and run like hell down the snowy road so she didn't get caught in death's backwash.

This man had said to her hardly an hour before with such misplaced hope, "Don't let me die." In the face of reality, it appalled and shamed her to have had the naive and stupid idea that she wanted to die. All she wanted was to turn back the clock and have him breathing next to her again.

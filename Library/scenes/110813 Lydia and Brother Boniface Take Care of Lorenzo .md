110813 Lydia and Brother Boniface Take Care of Lorenzo

\"You don\'t look much bigger than the mop,\" the odd little monk said.

\"You\'d be surprised what I can do if I put my mind to it.\"

After a few general questions about her -- was she going to school? Affirmative. What was she taking? Business Math and English. Good! Brother Boniface gave her the grand tour of the aging and hard worn facility. It looked to her like battles had been fought here. Scuffed walls. Linoleum so aged it was cracked in places. Ancient plumbing that wheezed and clanked like it was about to give up the ghost.

He led her to a janitorial closet and said, \"The upstairs hall could use a scrub. Mind if we test you out today?\"

Lydia had never picked up a mop. She knew what they were of course. She\'s seen the phalanx of maids and gardeners and cooks work at their duties in the 26 room mausoleum her grandmother lived in. Dutifully she took the mop by the handle, eyeing the grey ropy clump that looked like a Medusa\'s head of dead snakes.

Brother B -- not father, he corrected her, I\'m a friar. Very different from a priest! People call me Brother B. Makes things simpler -- sent her to an ancient sink almost bigger than she was and left a trail of soapy water behind her as she lugged the heavy pail to where she\'d abandoned the mop.

\"Have at it, my dear,\" Brother B beamed beatifically. \"I\'ll be back to check on you in a half hour.\"

She worked her way down a long hall flanked by narrow cells. Most of the doors were open. A narrow steel bed. Gray blue mattress ticking. One flattened pillow the thickness of a comic book.

It took her a while to figure out that she had to keep wringing out the mop or she was just pushing around the dirt. She wondered where Lorenzo lived. Did he have an assigned room or did he have to move in and out on some institutional schedule? She\'d never thought about being homeless. If those dirty street people stretch their hands out, she looked away and kept her head down on her way into Saks or Nieman Marcus. \"Spare some change,\" she\'d hear them call to her but she couldn\'t be bothered to spare a look.

It wasn\'t exactly an interview, she realized as she dragged the droopy mop back and forth across the hall. Brother Boniventure didn\'t ask much about her. He knew where Grosse Point was, when he asked where she hailed from. Detroit caught his attention. \"Home of Motown!\" he beamed, which seemed pretty odd for a guy in a brown burlap robe tied with a rope. \"I used to live in [\_\_\_]{.underline}town when I got out of seminary.\"

He asked her why she wanted to work at the Povarello Center instead of the food bank which was closer to Healing House. The real reason was because she wanted to know where Lorenzo was and besides James was doing his community service hours at the food bank, so that was pretty much a dead end. Luckily she remembered the prayer thing she\'s seen reading in the lobby and paraphrased what stuck in her head. \" Better to console than be consoled\" came out as \" Better to mop than be mopped,\" and Brother B clapped his boney hands. It sounded like the clatter of dry leaves but his good spirits were surprisingly addictive.

She was sweating up a storm within minutes but she doggedly threw the mop out in front of her and had made it almost all the way down the hall before she heard the gentle slap of his sandals. \"Look at you!\" Brother B called. \"You\'ve made the place sparkle.\" It would have taken a load of dynamite to break the layers of grime off. But still, Brother B\'s delight made her proud.

He lugged the dirty water for her to the sink, even though she tried to wrestle it from him. The old bird was surprisingly tenacious and strong. She mopped up the splash-over and was about to ask him if her knew Lorenzo, when the friar said, \"Come. You can help me with an errand of mercy.\"

He took her down the backstairs to an industrial size kitchen where he boiled water for tea and cut up cheese and bread with apples. \"One of our clients is sick with the flu.\" Then he stopped, as if concerned. \"You won\'t catch it will you?\"

\"I\'m pretty healthy,\" Lydia said. Brother B looked like he\'d blow over in a strong breeze \" Maybe you should let me deliver the food.\" Didn\'t old people have poor autoimmune systems? Lydia\'s grandmother, hypochondriac, was always wearing a mask when she played bridge with her group of old biddies.

\"Oh no dear,\" he said. \" This is the man-only floor so I\'ll have to be your escort.\"

Lydia carried the tray, the tea pot lid clinking as she climbed the stairs. Her legs felt like jelly but Brother B bounced up the 3 flights to the top of the building without a hitch in his breath.

He rapped on a closed door with his knuckles. A raspy voice said something indistinguishable which Brother B took as assent.

Holy macaroni! The door swung open and Lydia was amazed to see Lorenzo pale and sweating in the bed.

\"Come in, dear. Put the tray on the desk,\" motioned Brother B.

Lorenzo\'s eyes looked bleary and unfocused. He hadn\'t shaved. A soft rusty fuzz covered his lower face and his red curls sproinged out every direction.

He was looking at her with his mouth agape. \"Lydia!\" he croaked. \"You\'re not supposed to be up here.\"

She glanced at Brother B who was busy whipping a thermometer out of its wrapper. \"You two know each other?\"

Lydia felt embarrassed without knowing why. Lorenzo was shirtless. A mass of brown freckles covered his chest and shoulders and his skin was so pasty white his freckles stood out like peppercorns on an expanse of skin.

\"Lydia\'s our new janitor\'s assistant,\" Brother B said to Lorenzo. \"Did you know she\'s a mop maestro?\"

This was patently ridiculous but apparently Lorenzo was used to Brother B\'s sense of humor. He said, \"Takes a mop master to know a mop maestro.\"

\"What\'s wrong with you?\" Lydia asked. She was pouring out tea in a chipped white mug and she automatically put in 3 packets of sugar with the milk.

\"It\'s just the flu. But it\'s a mean one.\"

\"I haven\'t seen you since last Friday,\" she said. \" I was worried,\" Her admission seemed to flummox large-and-in-charge Lorenzo. \"Worried? About me?\" He had to speak around the thermometer Brother B had stuck in his mouth like a lollipop. When Brother B whipped out the stick, he peered at the mercury. He turned to Lydia and said, \"Can you read this? I misplaced my glasses.\" Lydia found of mercury without difficulty but frowned at what she saw. \"One hundred and three. Is that right?\"

Instinctively, she put her hand on Lorenzo\'s large forehead and felt heat radiating off him in waves. A memory of being very sick with a sore throat transported her to her old bedroom in New York when her mom and dad were still married. She felt a big cool hand on her head. Worried eyes in a dim and faraway face. Dad? Did he take care of me when I was sick? There was nothing else to the memory. Just the hand and a sense of concern. \"You\'re burning,\" she said.

Brother B said, \"It\'s time to call Dr. George, Lorenzo. This fever is lasting too long.\"

\"No, Brother. I\'ll be fine. Just give me a day to recover.\"

\"It might be strep throat,\" Brother B was busy massaging Lorenzo\'s jaw. \"Your lymph nodes are swollen.\"

\"I can\'t pay, Brother B. Don\'t call him.\"

\"Lorenzo we'll take care of Dr. George. You know he doesn\'t charge us like his regular patients.\"

Lorenzo seemed to be holding a swallow of tea in his mouth. Lydia now watched him take a sip but grimace from the pain of swallowing. Finally he let the liquid slide over his infected throat and a flash of pain darkened his eyes.

\"My mom will pay for the doctor. She can afford it.\" She didn\'t know how to tell Lorenzo or Brother B that the Hunt catsup fortune could buy any number of hospitals plus the pharmaceutical companies that supplied them.

\"Absolutely not!\" Lorenzo barked. Bad idea. The strain on his larynx sent him into a paroxysm of chocking that left him white and beaded with sweat.

\"My name is Lydia Rosenblum Heinz. You know how you were eating French fries the other day and pounding the Heinz bottle and swearing at it? That\'s the Heinz I\'m talking about.\" \"

You\'re hired,\" said Brother B. \"We need a new roof.\"

Lorenzo closed his eyes, whether in disbelief or in defeat, Lydia didn\'t know.

Brother Boniface made his phone call and then he walked Lydia to the front door. \"Good interview,\" he said. \"One of our best. Will M-W-F, 2-6, work with your classes?

Lydia kicked her way through 3 or 4 inches of snow that had fallen while she was in the Povarello Center. The sound of car traffic was hushed, somehow pillowed by the softly falling snow flakes the size of cotton balls. The street lamps lit golden arcs in the dinners and Lydia walked through the golden light feeling the slightly pleasurable ache of hard work between her shoulders. \"Good things come to those who wait.\" Maybe she should tell her mom they should bring the old Heinz slogan back. They\'d had it in the 80s before she was born. She\'d seen it once on an office wall when she went to visit her dad. It was a good one.

\"You can\'t pay for me! I pay my own way.\"

\"And how can you do that flat on your back, you big lug?\"

Lydia\'s mom, the serial marrier was always saying that men were idiots. Brother B was maybe the exception. Lorenzo proved the rule.

\"Do you still have a job?\" she asked.

Lorenzo\'s eyes swept off to the window.\"Probably not,\" he muttered.

\"So I\'ve got money and you don\'t. Who cares.\"

\"I care. I\'m not your responsibility.\"

\"A family is supposed to be responsible for you and yours is a piece of shit.\"

Lorenzo\'s voice was slow and stubborn. \"You\'re not family.\"

\"I\'m a friend, that trumps a fucked up family in this case. For maybe the 1^st^ time in Lydia\'s life, it occurred to her that by Lorenzo\'s shitty yardstick, her own family didn\'t look that bad. So her mom got married a lot but her grandma and grandpa were in her corner. Even her Dad could and kept her every summer vacation in the Hamptons. If she needed something, it was always there. Nobody would throw her out on her own to fend for herself, even with all the shit she pulled. She imagined the scene at the bus stop when Lorenzo\'s step dad handed him \$100 and walked away without a backward glance. It made her mad just thinking about it. There was a first for everything. Didn\'t Heinz employ a whole floor of corporate lawyers at the headquarters in [\_\_\_]{.underline} Ohio. Wouldn\'t at least one of them have time to investigate a fucking polygamist in Hildale, Utah? Her dad wasn\'t big on hugs and compliments but he was hella good at suing people.

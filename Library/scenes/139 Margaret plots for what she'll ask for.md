1:39 AM

ONLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE GALAXY knew why a pack of raccoons would abandon their cryptic coloration for a nuclear rainbow. One of them as lying at the Coeur D'Alene County morgue awaiting an autopsy; the other was too wired to sleep.

Poor Margaret had had one hell of a day. It was one thing to discovery Hazey's dug stash in the morning. At the time, it seemed like something so mammoth and so life changing, she could scarcely credit it. Then the mammoth discovery that had seemed so important a few hours before had paled in comparison to holding a dying boy in her arms.

What on earth would make a young, presumably healthy twenty-year-old drop dead in the ten minutes she left him by himself when she ran outside to deal with those damned raccoons? Would it have made a difference to Jason Horvath (she'd looked up his name on the intake form in Hazey's office) if she'd had the presence of mind to ignore the feral pests and sat down with him and held his hand on the couch and just listened to his galaxy of problems, instead of grabbing the paint gun and squeezing off half a dozen Day Glo paint rounds to spatter the little shits into radioactive confetti?

For the past hour, Margaret had been lying in her flannel sheets listening to Hank whiffle, fizz rumble and sizzle and snort. When she finally nudged him onto his side, a raspberry fart escaped him.

That did it.

She gave up on sleep and padded out to the kitchen to put on some cocoa. While she waited for the milk to heat, she snapped on the tinny transistor that Hank used to listen to the farm report every morning expecting to hear the dry-as-dust report on the rise and fall of corn and rape seed and soy bean yields. Instead, it was Macklemore's voice that lit up her well-worn kitchen with its cracking linoleum and the ailing refrigerator motor she would replace if she ever got a raise.

Macklemore intoned in a slightly nasal speaking voice like a priest to his congregation, "Tonight is the night. This is the moment."

And before he could even sing *Put your hands up!* a blaze of inspiration almost took Margaret's breath away.

The ceiling can't hold Margaret O'Leary, Dr. Hazey!

In exchange for Margaret's turning a blind eye to his drug use, Dr. Hazey was going to put Margaret in charge of his newest residence, the one that US Bank had just approved the loan on! Along with a healthy raise and full medical benefits, Margaret would be taking on the management of the nutrition department. Heads up Gretchen Beener! Meet your new boss. Oh and by the way, no more smoking on the job!

By the time Margaret climbed back into bed next to Hank who was a little damp and also snoring, she was already dreaming about new business cards. What should her title be? Queen Margaret? Czaress Margaret? Master Negotiator Margaret?

Yes, indeedy. She and Dr. Hazey were going to have a peaceful and productive---very productive---partnership.

Margaret O'Leary, Healing House Manager and Head Nutritionist. That had a nice ring to it, didn't it?

Too much?

Not nearly enough.

> Margaret loved Idaho. It was her home.
>
> She stepped out on the screened in porch where they kept wood stacked for the wood stove. It was bitterly cold in just her stocking feet but she was on the lookout for the Aurora Borealis, so it was worth it.
>
> She looked at the clear sky and the high, bright stars. No Northern Lights, though it was the weather for it. Good, high clouds, so it would continue cold. No snow for a while. She'd take cold over snow any day now that she had figured out how to get Dr. Hazey to pay for many new cords of wood.
>
> It was so beautiful in Idaho.
>
> The stars were sharp and crystal clear against absolute blackness in one of the few places on Earth that wasn't yet a victim of light pollution. The moon looked like a crescent of cheese, which made Margaret about face and bolt back into the kitchen to save the milk for the cocoa from boiling over.
>
> My beautiful Idaho, she thought, drinking hot chocolate to make her sleepy and watching the golden moon forging its way to slip under the \_\_\_\_\_\_ Mountains. She reviewed her children---not the biological ones---the ones at the Program who should be asleep in their beds. Lydia was still missing. No one had called her to say she was OK. Probably with that loose screw, Jed -- no, Ned\-- Simplot. Now Lydia had her mixing him up too. He was one of the lesser Simplots, born far from the tap root of the potato fortune. Where the bloodline ran out, she supposed.
>
> She sent up a little prayer for the continued safety of both her families, the biological one and the adopted one. She excepted Crazy Hazey from her prayer. She had big plans for the good doctor at nine AM.

063016 Tandem writes of OG and Lydia on the road

Idaho Potato Museum in Blackfeet, Idaho

Some enterprising museum worker had spread out a bunch of cuttings from all the eyes of one potato on the window sill. Nine! The docent enthused. The eyes of the potato were small growth centers. Each a center where life could spring from.

Lydia could see the thin strings of white roots floating in the water. They promised life if they got planted in the ground, she thought but if they didn't, then what? Did they rot? Did they dry out and shrivel when the water evaporated?

How long did it take for an eye to grow into a potato underground? Until spring? Or were they supposed to be planted in the fall and do whatever they did in the cold and then they were dug up before it got cold again. It seemed improbable to her. It didn't work that way with a dead body, did it? She imagined little Lydias waiting for the snows to melt and stepping out of the ground fully formed. It was bad enough being one of her. What if she had the bad luck to have nine lives like a feral cat. Save me.

She was sorry she had never had enough money to pay Lorenzo back for the French fries he bought her. Would he remember that she owed him? Would he remember her at all?

Lorenzo had to leave his Mr. Potato Head collection in Utah, he'd said. He didn't miss it. Would he miss her more, she wondered. She let the tendrils of sleep take her then, thinking of all the growth that was needed underground before she'd be found in the spring newly formed.

Lydia had no idea how far she had walked before she walked out of one boot. She stumbled on a rut and her right foot shot out in front of her while the back one caught and she fell in an awkward split that sent a fiery tendril of pain through her knee. She sprawled, completely winded while flakes as big as her thumbs landed on her exposed blue-white and goose-bumped legs. At first, the flakes disappeared as they met the heat of her skin but soon, she was conscious of a thin buildup of white furze. How long before it built up so it covered her like a soft blanket?

She made one effort to push to standing but the pain in her leg was like a red flame that she had to step away from.

After a while, she pulled the fur-ruffed hood away from her head so she could look up into the falling cotton snow. When they started collecting in her eyelashes, she let their weight close her lids and she lay listening to the infinitesimal sound of tiny steps that accompanied her into darkness.

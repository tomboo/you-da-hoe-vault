NEW + GOOD REPORT

.

I continue to be deeply engaged in the novel. It's on my mind all day, every day, and I am solving problems in the default mode network of my brain in wonderful ways. Seeing that I can and will finish is heartening.

Susan Bell''s *The Artful Edit* continues to be my editing guide. In general, I have gotten energized and interested in the puzzle of editing and where to put the pieces instead of resisting the rewrite. That's a big win.

My last four scenes of the novel ending has been tightened and honed. It's amazing how many hours of micro-editing I've done.

Instead of flailing and hacking on the computer, I experimented with hand editing hard copies of three OG (main character) scenes. This may be a better method for me. The hand edited scenes did a much better job of earning the character's decision to keeping moving at the end of the novel.

TRICKY BITS

The power of the Savage deadline fought hand and glove with some weird perfectionism. I had a crisis of faith in my judgement when I read the tightened scenes, especially the death scene of Rusty.

Noodling and flailing on the computer in the tightening process takes on too much power over the emotion of the drafts by hand. I found that the final edits I am putting in your Dropbox today don't always say what I want them to say.

I see that I need to find a way to edit that keeps the emotion and authentic voice I have while focusing it. Not sure I've hit on that yet.

Finally, I failed miserably at getting a tight edit of the final scene of my main character: OG Lights Out for the Territories. Yiiiii. The A student fails to turn in her complete homework!

FOCUS AND NEXT STEPS FOR THE JULY 30 DEADLINE

My goal for the next deadline is to complete tight drafts of all OG's scenes and arrive at a solid compilation of her Arc of Change. My "soft" goal is to find a way to edit that isn't all slash and burn and questioning every word.

NEXT STEPS + ACTIONS

Let's schedule a Zoom in the next week or so to discuss the editing issues and how to find a happier medium.

**Cynthia!**

There's a lot that's great in the book. The characters are interesting, namely Old Girl, Hazey, and James. Also Rusty is a good antagonist, and I like how he dies. Margaret is fine, but there's far too much of her in the book. Lydia is fine, but there's also too much of her, and the whole arc with Lorenzo just doesn't have much narrative propulsion. The other characters are vague, at best. Josh, Reza, Danny, etc.

You write men very well. Hazey's POV drops off, which is problematic. But you write him well, and James, and Rusty. Those are some of the best chapters, actually. Lydia doesn't feel especially convincing. There's some interesting conflicts around mental health, and what it means to be healthy, or ill, and the pathologizing that happens to kids who are "troubled." Also, some interesting tensions around class and money in the book, and the ways that power is expressed subtly and unsubtly through transactions relating to sex, money, "illness," and freedom/imprisonment.

Mostly, I think you've sort of over-written this draft, which is totally normal and healthy, I think it's even a good idea to over-write and then cut back. You sort of explain more than needs to be explained, you give all this backstory, all this emotional context, etc. And that's the first or second draft. And then you cut most of that out. Or, if you like the emotional stuff, maybe you cut it but you also make a nearby scene a little longer and try to make the scene demonstrate or show that same idea.

So, like, for example, when Lydia's waiting for James in the bathroom, there's all this thinking and unpacking of her mental state, and her background, and stuff, and you should cut all of that. But the scene with James is very short and pretty devoid of conflict, so if you'd like to demonstrate her pathology a bit more, let that scene be a little longer, and more painful, with her grabbing at him more and insisting a little more, almost trying to sexually assault him. That's more interesting than her sitting in the bathroom alone thinking.

There's a tendency to front-load info in the opening section, like the reader is meeting the whole cast before we've been given much of a reason to care about them. I like how Old Girl feels like the protagonist, even though she's often not very much on stage.

Basically, backstory is interesting mostly for the writer, and the reader has very limited attention span for it, it's the secondary story. Not the primary story. It's context, but it does not contain any hope, and the character can't do anything about it, because it's already happened. There's the concept of "B Story" and "A Story." The A Story is the primary narrative thread, in this case the stuff that's happening in and around the time Rachel enters Inner Horizons. That's the "present" of the story. Everything that happened before is context, and it's "B Story," and some of the secondary points of view are also "B Story" in that they are sufficiently removed from Old Girl's narrative that they feel pretty much beside the point (e.g. Margaret's story).

As a result of the profusion of backstory and interiority, especially in the first 70 or so pages, the scenes all feel pretty starved for space. Each chapter is like 1/5 of the main timeframe, 1/5 of the scene, and then 4/5 of digression and backstory and asides, observations, etc.

**TIMELINE:**

I really don't get it. Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow. The whole book takes place over three days? No, I don't think so. I'm sure it's because of the POV-switching, but I don't understand at all the sequence of events. Rachel is the new girl one day, but then she and Old Girl seem to have been roommates for a while, too. When was the fire? When did they go to the frozen lake? When did Lydia get busted giving a blowjob to that cowboy, and when did she go and clean up the homeless shelter? When was she throwing up outside of Dunken Donuts? Was that when she first met Lorenzo? And then Lorenzo and James were bagging potatoes one day? I have no idea. Without a clear timeline, you're going to have a very hard time getting narrative tension up and running. It's possible, but much harder to do.

What's the thematic purpose of having it structured as Today, Yesterday, and Tomorrow? Does that have some tie-in with therapy, or mental health? Maybe? I don't know about it, though.

**ARE THERE TOO MANY POINTS OF VIEW?**

Probably. Or they have to do more to work in concert. More dramatic irony.

**NARRATIVE TENSION:**

To be extremely concise about this: **You create short arcs when you could just as easily create long arcs.** **Long arcs are better because they create sustained tension and conflict and pressure within the book.**

For example: the reader doesn't know Old Girl's plan to run away until the night she attempts to run away. There's no good reason to deny the reader that info. File this under the difference between good info to give to the reader versus info it's good to withhold: this is info the reader needs. This info provides strong narrative tension and suspense: she is going to do something dangerous and risky . . . she has a SECRET! It's great. Let us know in Chapter One. And then you can wait until page 70 for her to actually make a go of it. But in the interim, you have opportunities to increase the narrative tension. Like, she might have to steal a pill during the seizure in chapter one. Someone sees her do that! And then you have tension. Also, when we see how cold it is outside, we'll be thinking: OH NO, THIS IS DANGEROUS. She can even be thinking that.

Another example: Let us know that the Rusty the Garbage Man is very sketchy early on. Just come out and make it clear. Do a chapter from his POV, probably.

Another example: Margaret lands on her plan to extort Hazey in the final 20 pages of the book . . . that could happen MUCH earlier. Or she could discover that he's got a secret.

Also: We get a keen understanding very very late about why Old Girl wants to run away.

Also: Rusty's decision to kill James happens 40+ pages after the fire. Could happen immediately, and then we get to be worried about it for 40 pages. Tension!

The middle section, in particular, is extremely episodic. Margaret goes to Costco, James flirts with this girl (we never see her again), Lydia has sex with this cowboy (never see him again) and there's a fight, and James wakes up with a crow on his pillow, Old Girl gets buried in a snow cave briefly, this new kid shows up and then dies immediately (talk about short arc!), and all these things happen, but there's no clear string of causation. There's no follow-up on these incidents, either. It's just a bunch of independent incidents that have been shuffled together, it seems. There's not much through-line.

**POV:**

The POV is inconsistent, sometimes switching mid-chapter, sometimes distant, sometimes close. I can't tell what the plan is. Often it's quite distant with Old Girl, which is strange, and then very close with someone like James. Also Hazey is perhaps the most convincing POV of them all.

Rusty is a bit different, and some of his chapters are distinctly different, but it's not nearly different enough, and it's not consistent. His POV should have a completely different tone to it.

Also, there are a lot of quoted thoughts, throughout. That's not really done in literary fiction anymore. Sometimes, but pretty rarely. I would get rid of all of those. They really only make sense when you're switching POV in the middle of a scene, they serve to signal to the reader that you are switching POV. Often, you don't actually put quotes around the thoughts, but they're in italics, or not in italics, but it's the same effect. It's also adding a filter word, like "she realized." I would usually or always avoid that stuff.

**Voice/POV question:**

All the characters seem to have the same snarky quality. . . and they all lean on clichés too much. I worry that they're not differentiated enough. When Margaret comments that they're so in the middle of nowhere that they don't even have a garbage collection service, she seems to have a kind urban disdain for the remote-ness of the place, but I think of her as being from there. When James thinks about Gretchen, he's cracking wise in more or less the same way that everyone else would crack wise: "At least Gretchen wouldn't be touching food while she was busy supervising the group they left behind. James couldn't understand how even her carrot sticks tasted weird." That same sense of humor is present in all the different points of view. No one is earnest, or serious.

**NOTES AS I READ:**

**Chapter One:**

Starts quite strong, although definitely kill the opening paragraph. The way the chapter works overall is, to my mind, insufficiently dramatic. Far too much digression and piping-in of character info into every crevice \-- feels more like overt "set up," which is problematic. Old Girl is immediately interesting, and feels like the protagonist in a great way, and there's fascinating energy around her. I like her a lot, her intelligence and her toughness and her kindness.

But then what does she do? Basically, she sits and watches other people, thinking about these other people. She's not trying to accomplish anything. She has no secrets, no plans. That's all she does. And at some point, as a reader, I lose interest . . . she's observing this person doing something, or filling the reader in about the backstory regarding so-and-so, and she's thinking about this and that. Is there something you can do to make her more active in the chapter? Give her something to do. Some plan.

**Chapter Two:**

Again, the opening doesn't quite work. The first page all this information is being showered down on the reader, and it's very disorienting, the stuff about Gretchen, and stuff. All these characters, and so on, and the context, etc. We don't need to know about Margaret's husband yet, or really much. Just show the scene with Hazey, which is great, and then have her go to his house, and the reader can fill in the rest. No rush on that front. At the house, you digress so much again, all that stuff about Rusty, and their family, etc. Good stuff for you to know, but you can cut it from the book. I know he's an important character, but you're "leading the witness" in legal terms, laying it on thick. And the extent of the descriptions of everything in his house---it's too much. You gotta cut some of it out. Also, too much about Old Girl, that page . . . it feels like leading the witness. This chapter is much slower than subsequent chapters. The book picks up a lot of speed later.

**Chapter Three:**

I like how it picks up in that same group therapy session. Lydia's an interesting character, but I don't buy the slang and her cultural references feel out of date, here. She seems more natural later in the book. The voice is kind of forced here. I think you need to get the cultural references to feel more contemporary and so on. Friday the Thirteenth and so on, and then she's talking about Pavlov's dog (someone else mentions Pavlov, too, actually, later). The character didn't quite feel lived-in fully. Again, the digression---all stuff that's very useful for the author, but the reader doesn't need it. Especially about her cousin who raped her, the first couple paragraphs about him are so fantastic, but then when she's in the bathtub the narrator does another page of unpacking and analyzing him and his life and what it meant for her, and it feels simultaneously too self-aware, and also too on the nose, too overt. Like "That was the unbearable feeling Lydia was having at being left empty without having any flopping or jerking." That's way too direct. The reader can infer that. Also, she's a sex addict, and this teenage boy is saying no, because he's too upset by the seizure, and she isn't angry at him? It's not like the girl died, she just had a seizure, if I were her I'd be like, "This is not a good reason to not fuck." If anything, it's a perfect reason to have sex. Looking for ways to increase the conflict.

**Chapter Four:**

Interesting that the POV feels most close that the opening of this chapter, the first James chapter (you write men very well!!). But then it backs off, and we're back seeing the blow-by-blow of this girl and her seizure. It's pretty low-stakes, in a way, she's not a person any of these characters know, and I just don't get why they'd care THAT much. As the reader, I don't really care about her. It's intense, but it feels overmuch. And there are all these metaphors in the prose in this chapter, which take the reader away from the moment. Metaphors generally don't make sense when the characters are experiencing something really intense. They're cranial, and by definition they're abstract, so they're distancing, and take us away from the immediacy.

Again the chapter didn't DO much. He kind of helps out with something we already know about, this epileptic fit, and we see a few minutes more of the kids interacting, but it's not revelatory. And then there's another digression, this one about his mom, and then it's basically over. It covers the same ground that the two other chapters have now covered, and he doesn't have much to DO in the chapter, other than observe, and think.

**Chapter Five**

Holy crap this is great! The voice is so natural, and it's an interesting situation, and the digressions are handled well, and Hazey's lust for Old Girl makes sense, and I'm glad he doesn't actually want to do anything about it, because he's not a stereotypical "bad guy," he actually wants to help her. Maybe the scene with Lydia's mom could be a bit more vivid . . . the main scene is still a bit starved for attention, because of the quantity of digression and interiority.

**Chapter Six**

This is a repeat of the Lydia chapter from before. I think this version might be a bit different, with even more backstory, but the name of the game is less backstory.

**Chapter Seven**

Rachel chapter. Very slight . . . nothing really happens. Rachel goes with Old Girl to take meds. They take meds. Too slowly building relationship. Not enough. Like, if the point of the chapter is to start to build their relationship, that's not enough of a point for the chapter. It needs to do more than that.

**Chapter Eight**

Old Girl's POV. Nice first few pages. Some anachronisms, like iPod. And again, not much happens. They're on their way to a mountain. She is angry at the thief.

**Chapter Nine**

James' POV. He's such a sweetie . . . I find it slightly hard to believe that he's so tender and kind. Like that he's uncomfortable with all the sex with Lydia because there's not enough of an emotional connection. He might be annoyed that she doesn't seem to like him, maybe even angry at her about that, but if he's a teenage boy then I don't think he'd have an easy time refusing easy sex with an attractive girl. Maybe? The chapter ends with more backstory, including repeated stuff about his parents. I'd get rid of that. There's some good tension because three of the kids have broken away from the group.

**Chapter Ten**

POV starts to get wonky here. This is ostensibly Rachel's chapter, but there's a bit of Old Girl, too. And Chapter Eleven is fully switching between them. So far, Rachel isn't very interesting. She's also a sweet person, nice, kind, etc. What's wrong with her? I find her very vague.

This is the chapter in which the moose or elk (switching animals) falls into the ice. That's an interesting moment, but a few things:

1.  Dramatically, it's a missed opportunity . . . like the three kids escaped from the group, and then they watch this thing and get reunited with the group. End of tension. End of scene. The whole problem is resolved so quickly.

2.  Their response to seeing the animal drowning is so healthy and normal. They try to get a stick to save it. That's predictable, what any teens would do. There's not even really an argument about what they should do. What does it tell us? They're normal, I guess. I didn't really "get" it. There's also weird distancing POV things, here. Like the narrator goes "Dr. Hazey, had of Inner Horizons" as if we don't know who Dr. Hazey is. It's just a weird thing, makes the reader feel like the chapters have been shuffled.

3.  Then it's over and basically no big deal. The others speculate as to what happened, but no one says. Why? Why does Rachel think no one says?

**Chapter Eleven**

More of the continuity stuff. Like "Her new roommate, Rachel," when of course the reader knows that. Also, the POV is jumping back and forth. Lots of quoted thoughts. And again, like Chapter Seven, it seems like it's just Rachel and Old Girl hanging out, getting along. Rachel is sweet. Old Girl is pretty nice, too. What's the problem? What do they want? We're informed that Old Girl wants a razor, but I definitely don't get that from her. She spends the whole day on a treadmill, but she's intensely depressed? Maybe, sure...but I'm not really sure why she's always on the treadmill, it just doesn't seem like a favorite pastime of the suicidal. Her suicidal thoughts, so far, all seem to be tacked onto her. The walking out into the snow, or the razor, or the icicle, and so on. It doesn't feel very organic, yet. And, in fact, her suicidal tendencies seem to vanish in the second half of the book.

**Chapter Twelve**

Old Girl's chapter, again. Good scene with Old Girl and Rachel. I'd cut the two previous chapters that are somehow about them connecting, it seems. This is when they actually connect. There are some issues here, for sure, but it's good. POV goes briefly omniscient, and there are a slew of clichés at one point, a lot of talk about the heart doing this and that, which feels a bit ordinary and is universally inapt.

**Chapter Thirteen**

Yet *another* Old Girl chapter, is it starting to be weird that she gets so many in a row? Here is where we learn VERY LATE, what her plan is, i.e. that she plans to run away. That would be a great thing for us to learn in the opening chapter. It's a great plot thing, it's a great character thing, it's great in a dozen ways. She has a secret, which creates tension. It's superb. You could almost forklift a bunch of this into chapter one. But she still needs to DO something during that chapter. Maybe she needs to steal another pill? Maybe someone sees her steal it? Just thinking about how to create more narrative tension.

**Chapter Fourteen**

She escapes and more moose, we need less moose, and then she lies down in the road. Fine, I suppose, but again seems like a missed opportunity. You've just had your protagonist make a major major decision that could have lots of interesting effects---I was eager to see her hitch-hiking, and the following morning at Inner Horizons, etc. But then she lies down to kill herself. So she makes two big decisions in the space of like 8 pages, after she hasn't made a decision at all for the previous 60-some pages.

**SECTION II**

**1.**

Yay, another chapter from Hazey's POV. Wait, she's 18? If she's 18 then she could just leave, right? She wouldn't have to escape. Is she really so mentally ill that the State would not permit her to walk out of an inpatient facility on her own? Maybe. Not sure how it works, but I'm a little suspicious of that. These kids aren't actually kids . . .they're adults, in the eyes of the law, so wouldn't they be as free as any other adult? I know that if you attempt suicide you get a mandatory 3 week stint as an inpatient in a psych ward, but then you're free to go. You can perhaps choose to stay, if you have the money to do so. Maybe I'm wrong about that?

2\. Mini chapter from POV of James. Good job of layering stories together, and using multiple povs and time shifts to keep things interesting.

3\. Lydia chapter about James and Shovel Face. Nice.

4\. Rachel chapter almost entirely about her backstory. Not enough narrative propulsion around Rachel in her "A story" for this "B story" of her background. Also, is it actually true that her parents could simply give away her baby to an adoption agency without her consent? Maybe? If so, I'm surprised. Even if you're a kid, you have some rights. Maybe that's allowed? I would be very surprised if parents can put their kid's kid up for adoption without their kid's consent.

5\. Ah! Rusty chapter. He's a bit creepy and a bit pervy, but I think you could play it up a bit. The voice doesn't change THAT much for his POV in this chapter, which seems strange.

6\. Lydia chapter about eating donuts and barfing. Interesting that I assumed that she was the one Rusty was perving on. If that was intentional, good move. The obsession with name brands is new for her, or I haven't seen that before.

7\. James' POV about his backstory, which should probably be cut, also. Large floating chunks of backstory are rarely engaging, especially if there's not a strong "A Story" to bide us over while we're pursuing the "B Story." (Backstory is all, by definition, basically "B story" and doesn't have the same stakes as a primary or "A Story.")

8\. Rachel wakes up and barfs outside, and we realize that it was her that Rusty was looking at. It's good.

9\. James' POV in the bathroom where he runs into Rachel, and then the professor enters.

10\. Rachel's POV talking to the professor. Very good movement using the different POVs. Feels quite different from section one.

11\. Rachel talking to Lorenzo. Nice that there's a bit of menace from Rusty out there in the world . . . I wish there was even more menace from him, or a sense that he's out there lurking, staring at them.

12\. Pretty long Margaret chapter. Not THAT interesting, but it's fine. Who is Danny? Also Esty? Feels quite off topic, basically. Not sure what this chapter's doing.

13\. Another Margaret chapter. Lydia is "the new girl"? I thought Lydia had been there for a while, and Rachel was the new girl. I'm confused about time. Does Margaret know all these brands, the Prada bag, the Frye boots. Maybe.

14\. Dr. Hazey. The end is nice when he goes into reverie and passes out. The writing is lovely there. The beginning isn't working, though, he's reading much too "villainous" in the opening pages of this chapter. Sipping cognac and listening to ukulele music in his Bose headphones, scoffing at the people who send their kids to him, planning his vacation to Fiji, etc. It's not complicated, and he seems less like a full real person than he did before. Much less interesting, more like TV bad guy. Also, the opening of the chapter is slow . . . he's sitting there thinking and listening to music for two pages. Also, I learned recently that they don't manufacture quaalues anymore -- drug manufacturers stopped making them a couple decades ago, apparently. So he wouldn't taking those, unless he bought them on the black market, or he had some leftover from the 1980s.

Also, the argument that happens between the bookkeeper and the psychiatrist is a bit over the top, you don't need that for tension and conflict. It's less about the intensity of the conflict, and more about the placement of the conflict. Like, if we knew about this type of tension, that Inner Horizons had this kind of inner war between the money people and the doctors, then it'd inform our reading for the first 100+ pages. Like, plan the seeds of these conflicts early, and you can do it subtly.

15\. Margaret chapter. It's fine, good. But reader's not that invested in her story, somehow. She has plot function, I suppose, but her chapters seem long, and not much happens.

16\. Good Rusty chapter. I think you need to push his voice a lot more. Check out the short story "Dark Meadow" by Adam Johnson, I think it's in his new book. And the POV of the would-be kidnapper and rapist in George Saunder's "Victory Lap." You've got to sort of sincerely inhabit the POV. There's too much of someone else in there, keeping us on the outside of his experience, where it's easier to judge him negatively. One other thing, he's wearing all black but it's snowy out there, so he'd be extremely visible, especially with the moonlight, and stuff. And where does he park his truck? Probably pretty far away? Also, in chapter 19 you say that there are Christmas lights out there, still lighting everything up outside . . . wouldn't he be visible?

17\. Who's POV? Oh, Rachel . . . it's hard to tell. Not much happening in this chapter.

18\. Rusty POV again. Voice is much better here . . . much more convincing and vivid. I don't understand what his claw thingy is with the camera on it. For the life of me, I can't picture it. Where is he? Is he in their room, or . . . it's not clear. Oh, he's outside? Is it cold? Don't they feel the cold air when he opens the window?

19\. Rachel chapter. Tough combo of Rachel and Margaret, both of whom are less interesting, and there's no conflict, either. They're just doing errand with Charlie, and talking about the past, which is also not dramatic. I'd definitely cut this chapter. I like the end where she thinks about her kid, and also the window open a crack.

20\. Chase Mortimer . . . oh, I don't know if I want another character in the book. Already a lot of people to keep track of. More Quaaludes. Definitely an anachronism, not something a kid in Middlebury would do---there was an article in Newsweek recently about Quaaludes, and they haven't been available legally or illegally in the US really since the 1980s. It's well written, I think. Hopefully he'll die? Sort of a cheap trick to bring him on stage and then kill him? Probably better to kill one of the other characters who's not as important. Otherwise it's writer not wanting to kill a "real" character but wanting to kill a character. Writer's desires are too clearly visible. Maybe kill Esty or someone?

The switch to her POV is fine.

21\. Hazey chapter. Certification Review Board preparation hasn't been set up. Again, a missed opportunity for tension or plot. He has a thing he wants to achieve, and there's something on the line, and so on. But if it's not set up well in advance, then there's no possibility of tension around this issue. Nice chapter, and the kid is dead, I see. Not sad or meaningful for the reader since we didn't know or care about that kid. Still needs something.

In general, the plot is now taking off, but we're 150 pages into the book, so I think it really needs to happen sooner. Not necessarily that hard, in a way. You just have to introduce these things earlier, like: The stuff about Hazey trying to expand the business, the corruption there, and Rusty being a really spooky and rape-y guy, and Old Girl planning on escaping, etc. All good, but showing up so late in the book.

22\. Old Girl chapter. Been wondering if she were still around. A little confused about timeline. Let's see . . . this is before Old Girl tries to escape, but it's after Rachel arrives. Um . . . and this kid dies, but in the first section of the book . . . well that's when Rachel arrives, right? And the kid dies after Rachel arrives and before Old Girl runs away . . . I'm confused.

23\. Rusty got his peeping tom pictures developed at Rite Aid? That seems like an easy way to get arrested. Also, wouldn't he have a digital camera? This is fairly contemporary story, right?

24\. Lydia and Lorenzo go on a date . . . book feels like it's meandering, now. These two are never going to command enough fascination to merit the page space they're given. As a reader, I've lost the thread. Not too invested in Lorenzo and Lydia as a couple. Also, extensive backstory on his experience growing up in FLDS, and the stuff about the history of the Mormon faith seems sort of beside the point. The end of the chapter is quite good, but Lydia's not quite a protagonist of the book, but she is sort of a protagonist, and here she is having a nice time with this nice guy. I'm not concerned about her, and she doesn't seem to be coming apart, she seems to be having a nice time. So no tension there.

25\. Margaret chapter . . . she's hanging out with the kids, but she's mainly in her own head, and there's not a lot of tension here. She's not got a "plan." So much of plot is like: *Person has problem and a desire, and then they make a plan*. I see some problems for her, and some desires, but she's sort of just hanging out, which gives the story this meandering quality.

26\. James' call to his parents. Good chapter, but what's the storyline here? Nice end, there's some extra stuff, too much set-up, and maybe the conversation with his parents could be longer, or more involved? It's pretty truncated. You write James' point of view well.

27\. Long Old Girl chapter about Animal Farm essay, and comparing Animal Farm to Inner Horizons. Part of the issue here is that I don't know when this is happening. And then Esty thing . . . but again, where's Old Girl's plan? Where's her mission? She's just hanging around watching people. Old Girl works on essay, and then there's the Esty wetting herself thing, and then they're eating dinner, and then there's the Reza and Esty fight . . . and at least here Old Girl urges Esty on, but she doesn't have a plan. Mostly, she's just watching things transpire, even the fight itself, she's just watching it transpire. Then she finally acts up with Danny, but by now this is page 190, and the chapter started on 177.

28\. Lydia and Lorenzo, cont. More backstory for Lorenzo. He's homeless, and she doesn't want that for him . . . but reader doesn't really care about him. And it seems frivolous of her. He doesn't seem concerned about himself, but she is? Not sure what's at stake? She's hanging out with him, and it's nice. But what's she trying to do? Live an innocent life, maybe? Doesn't seem like a pressing problem.

29\. Rusty chapter. Good stuff.

30\. Old Girl's chapter. She discovers the fire. Strange flashback to earlier that day, I think? Confusing scene with Margaret. Timing not clear. I'm confused.

31\. Rusty at the scene of the fire, sees James with Rachel, and gets jealous. Good tension.

32\. Old Girl is running down the hallway screaming fire. This is a step back in time? Then she's outside, and she sees Rusty . . . her hat is stolen by a bat? By an owl? Raccoon? Not exactly clear. Why is time jumping back and forth here? All these animals with paint on them is interesting. Cool image.

33\. Old Girl short chapter where she asks Rachel if she knew that firefighter.

34\. The fire from Rachel's point of view, now. And her scrap book. Is it just the girl's dorm that went up in flames? If so, why is James out there, too? Is it all one building? Having trouble visualizing the layout of Inner Horizons. Rusty was in the "crawl space," which means he's sort of in the attic? How did he get there? Anyway.

35\. Rusty chapter about how he set the fire, and so on. Jumping back in time.

**NOTE: THIS IS WHEN THINGS START TO BECOME REALLY EPISODIC IN THIS MIDDLE SECTION . . .**

36\. James bagging potatoes the day after the fire. Sort of bummed more didn't come of the fire. Like nothing much happened. There was a fire, it was put out, and then . . . I guess everyone went back to sleep? Presumably not in the same building? And then Lorenzo shows up, which is convenient. They hang out. Not much happening. He realizes Lorenzo likes Lydia. Sort of uneventful. Feels episodic, I guess.

37\. James is sleeping now. Wakes up to find he's been sleeping on a rotting crow, which is interesting and gross. But definitely episodic. I'm not clear if it was inside the pillowcase, or outside. What's this about?

38\. ANOTHER James chapter. This time he's in Shakespeare class . . . amplifying the feeling of the story being episodic. Stand alone episode, stand alone episode, etc. He likes a girl in his class. Weed from Tijuana? That's pretty lousy weed, probably, not something you'd declare with pride. Maybe say "skunk weed" but even still, that's pretty terrible in this day & age. Wouldn't they have weed from Humbolt, or something? Or she could say she has some indica. Or something that's actually appealing. "Does a bear shit in the woods?" is a cliché. He gets busted by Margaret. Then Margaret sees Lydia having sex (I think? Not entirely clear) with cowboy . . . and then they attack the cowboy. It's a very fun and charming scene. This chapter is great, but definitely contributing to the episodic feel of the book. Fun, but the events are not building through a string of causation . . . new characters, new plot elements showing. What about the fire? Lorenzo? Rusty? Hazey?

39\. Is this a James chapter? POV very distant. They're bowling now, Rachel and James. Another episodic turn. Wait, no POV is Rachel, who's eye-humping him at the bottom of 230. No, POV shifts to James next page when he sees the expression in her eyes, and when he spends his money on the cheeseburger. What's the situation with this chapter? They're hanging out? Why? Not sure what the conflict is . . . not sure what he wants, or what she wants. They are attracted to each other, yes, but that's very low stakes. They're not in love or anything, and even if they were it'd be low stakes. There's nothing to lie about or conceal or anything. Paragraph at the top of 233 contains too many uses of the word "want" and its variations. Then it becomes a nice moment where he talks about the girl he killed, and Rachel is very understanding. Catsup is an antiquated word, it's commonly referred to as ketchup, now.

40\. Now Lydia chapter with cowboy . . . this is immediately after that scene earlier. James' personality seems a bit different in this chapter.

41\. Margaret chapter. Lydia is arguing with Charlene in the entry. Some of them are going to the car? Didn't they just come back? What's the purpose of this chapter? Not sure.

42\. Lydia chapter. She gets a volunteer job at the homeless shelter so that she can be near Lorenzo? When is this? Jumping the shark here, a little. The arc around her relationship with Lorenzo does not have enough thrust to keep her storyline aloft. He's just not that interesting, and there's so little at stake. Even if they fall in love and get married it doesn't mean much to the reader. The book is about kids dealing with serious problems, and this sweet boy from Utah who is having a fling with this sex-addicted rich girl . . . I think part of the problem is that she's just NOT a protagonist of the book. Her issues do not seem so difficult. She's like the comic relief. Brother B is interesting. But then what . . . she's going to swoop in with all her money and fix the roof? It's not a story. It's very, very episodic, too.

43\. Margaret is on an errand at Costco. Episodic, still. She runs into a woman who lets it leak that Hazey is thinking of expanding Inner Horizons. A very round-about way for her to learn this info. Running this elaborate errand, etc. Is there a way to make it happen without introducing yet another character?

44\. Rusty the night of the fire. He's going to get a gun, planning to shoot James. Man, it'd be nice to know that a lot earlier. Good chapter, just in the wrong place.

45\. Old Girl's reason for wanting to flee is explained a little, i.e. that there's no way out of Inner Horizons. Interesting idea, also would have been better to hear this thought early in the book. Got VERY confused when they're standing in front of a fire, I assumed it was the building. But no, it's the day of the hike. I can't remember when that was. There's this whole story about the cave, and then it caves in, and Josh gives her mouth-to-mouth. Okay, but so episodic. Not sure why we're reading this now.

46\. Old Girl chapter again. Interesting group therapy after the cave in. Good chapter.

**TOMORROW**

12:32 AM Lydia secures the donation for the Brother B. It's interesting, but just not worth all the elaborate set up.

1:39 AM OMNISCIENT? No, Margaret chapter as she lies in bed thinking about the dead kid. She comes up with her scheme to get a raise out of Hazey. This idea could have come along a lot earlier, too. Very late in the book for her to have a "plan."

4:13 AM Coyote chapter . . .

4:33 AM Rusty is drink-driving, as they say in the UK.

4:36 am (note: cap versus not cap "AM" or "am" is inconsistent). Old Girl and the accident. We sort of saw this at the end of the first section, and reader can see it coming from the long way off, now. Maybe less preamble, then, because we know exactly what's going to happen. This could be the end of the book.

The last two Hazey sections are fine, but there's no reason that have to happen this day. Can't it happen earlier?

Drafts for Wendy and Emily:

These are segments of Lydia reimagined as sicker and more self-destructive.

I need help on how far I can push her and still keep her sympathetic.

1)  **091516 Lydia Waits for Stand-Up Sex with James**

Four

Lydia waited for stand-up sex with James in the bathroom off the living room. Shucked of jeans, naked from the waist down except for cotton socks, it felt like she was standing on a block of ice. The cast iron tub was the size of an iceberg. If James didn't hurry, she'd be carried off by wolves driven by the icy wind prowling under the window sill.

In two hours---exactly one hour and 56 minutes, according to Grandpa Ben's birthday present of a Piaget watch ---Lydia's mother was coming to visit . If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart.

She'd already checked her wallet. The t \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse during the new girl's epileptic fit was safely tucked away. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black nails. It would also pay for a French manicure with perfect white crescents, a service \$60 bucks on New York's upper East Side and \$15 in Idaho. The only good thing about Idaho.

If she'd known Rahel would show up in Couer D'alene, she'd never have gone Goth Girl.

Looking around at the faux oak veneer in the faux Shaker bathroom---even the toilet seat was blond oak---Lydia made a note to herself to remember to stash her cheap-ass Betsey Johnson knock-off tote on her roommate, Esty's, side of the room. Her mother had a thing about wearing fakes. "You and I know what's real," she liked to say.

Even in authentic Jimmy Choos, Rahel would be faster than Lydia in running shoes. Her mother kept herself tiny as a ferret and she was always harping after Lydia to lose weight. Gain two pounds and it was social suicide on Rahel Bronfman's scale. What man would want you if you were fat?

The first thing Lydia planned to do after Rahel took off on her Lear jet was to run down to Dunkin' Donuts in downtown Coeur D'Alene and stuff herself with every cake donut and cream cruller on the shelf. She'd imagine her mother looking at the clouds from thirty-thousand feet while her daughter scarfed donut after donut until she couldn't stuff in another bite. Then Lydia would open her mouth and vomit everything she'd swallowed into the maw of the second hand purse her mother left behind for her birthday. That's what I think of your stinking birthday present, Mom.

Lydia wondered what in hell was keeping James. She pushed away the image of the new girl's blond ponytail thumping the hardwood. The sightless eyes rolled up white. The wild tattoo of her heels. Lydia's Godzilla itch for sex, as relentless and bad as it was, was at least on the inside of Lydia's body long with all the other horrible things she kept locked up in her. Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside of her petite and perfectly maintained body. It was a small mercy that she didn't have to wear her ugliness on the outside like the hair shirt of epilepsy the new girl was saddled with.

She had been hoping the new arrival at Inner Horizons would be a boy. Actually, a hella-boy with a hella-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed on Saturday when a tall, bleary-eyed blond named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her she could only have herbal tea!

Another of Inner Horizon's rules that had no reason why. It was unanswerable like why no boy wanted anything to do with Lydia outside of sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped, the smell of sex trailing after them like skunk. Were guys like James, clueless in all other things, somehow onto her desire to make them weak? Once they got what they wanted, did they intuit that she didn't have anything else to give? What else would you give someone when you already gave them access to your body? No clue.

Yesterday after marathon monkey sex in the girl's restroom at Northern Idaho Community College where she'd started taking classes, James had muttered, "I feel dirty."

She felt like he'd slapped her. "I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's..." James thought for a long moment as if trying to order his thoughts. "You're like a Hoover. So mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels ... ah... impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

James was holding a spent condom between his thumb and forefinger like a rat corpse when in fact, the squirmy thing was filled with his own sperm. "You make me feel used," he said.

Used and abused was how Lydia felt when he slunk out of the NICC restroom. Now waiting behind the shower curtain in a fake Shaker decor, she felt even worse. No wonder she was having more bulimic episodes.

That was the real reason she was locked up in Idaho. Her orthodontist in Grosse Point ratted her out, telling Grandpa Ben and Gramma Elaine that the back sides of her teeth were pitted as a forty-year-old's. What a shit show. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food, but there was no fucking way she'd ever be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. It was a vicious cycle. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was so empty. She hadn't thought of it till that moment, but fucking her brains out for a few minutes lasted about as long as it took to eat a dozen donuts. Then, once you threw up, you were empty and clean as snow.

By the time the door James finally jingled the shower rings like Pavlov's bell, Lydia was already clambering up his lanky body. She threw her legs around his hips and tightened them around his waist until he grunted. She couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He was just starting to kiss her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes widened and locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard.

When the door shut, a pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands.

"I can't. That new girl... I thought she was dying," James said, holding her away with stiffened arms.

I'm dying, Lydia thought, having a moment of empathy for the epileptic girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Lydia felt at being left empty without any flopping or jerking.

"You don't have to think! Just feel!" She was hauling at his belt buckle, convinced he was kidding. She tried to undo the belt and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!"

"No!" James straight-armed her in torso. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" She patted at the area below his belt, looking for evidence of welcome. When she came up flat, she said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way her eyes rolled up in her head?"

Lydia's thighs were wiry and toned from years of gymnastics and ballet . She tightened them into a death grip but James, who was way stronger, ended up pushing her down like a donut below his knees.

"Don't hold out on me!" she wailed.

"I'm not. I just ..." James hesitated.

In the pause, she shot up and slapped him as hard as she could.

"What the hell?" James's cheek flushed bright red where her hand had lit his skin like a flare. "Why'd you do that!?"

"I need it!"

Now the flush looked more like a trouble light on James's cheek. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly turning me on."

"Dick head!"

"Now you're calling me names? What? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

"Fucking dick!" They were both huffing like whales at the surface. Lydia felt a rising volcanic pressure in her chest that was making it hard to breathe.

James was already backing away from her. He stepped out of the tub, jangling the curtain rings like an alarm bell. That's when Lydia's coldness vanished in a flash of heat so intense, she felt like a furnace blast was fueling her.

"You fucking faggot!" she cried. "You can't get it up. You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked up. The red on his cheek bones where she slapped him burned bright in blue-white skin.

"Limp dick! "Her openhanded slap snapped his head back. "Dickless wonder!" Another slap.

"You weren't calling me names an hour ago!" James was referring to the quickie she gave him before breakfast up against the back wall of the Healing House garage when they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that the raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins the night before.

That was then, this is now, she thought. Didn't James know that the Godzilla itch started from zero about 30 seconds after sex was over?

"Faggot!"

James had his hand on the white, porcelain door knob and for a deranged instant, Lydia had the impression he was fondling a skull. "Why would I fuck you?" he said." You're fucking crazy."

The bathroom door shut with snick. The sound of clicking and bumping ice. Lydia let her body slide down the cold white tiles until her head rested on the cold white porcelain tub and she watched the ice floe drift away from land.

2)  Hazey and Lydia meet her mother

Rahel Bronfman Fiat, soon to be ex-Fiat whenever her next divorce came through, sailed into Dr. Hazey's office and air-kissed Lydia on both cheeks. It occurred to Lydia that maybe her mother missed her cheeks by an inch because her daughter truly wasn't there.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A flutter of an eyelid told Lydia that Rahel hated that she'd stopped straightening her curls because there wasn't a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "So informal and free." Translation: rustic enough to merit jail time in Manhattan where her mother lived.

While her mother smiled at her with her nose high in the air, Lydia contemplated ripping off Rahel's false eyelashes and shoving them up her cosmetically enhanced nostrils. She had two of them, didn't she? Two roads to hell.

3)  **091516 Lydia Punishes Herself**

All day, Lydia had kept a rigid balance sheet and by nine pm, it was time to see what it added up in her moral accounting. She went over today's score at the sink in the room she shared with Etsie while she flossed and brushed her teeth.

> 1\) Stealing \$20 from Darlene's purse.
>
> 2\) Slapping the shit out of James for refusing to have sex.
>
> 3\) Crying like a baby in front of her mother, then telling Dr. Hazey to fuck off.
>
> 4\) Joining in on the Estie torment with psychopath Danny and sycophant Reza, both of whom made her want to puke, then poking Estie until she lost it and stabbed Reza in the back of the hand with her fork.
>
> 5\) When they hauled Estie off to Stable, she grabbed Estie's dinner brownie and crammed it down her throat, puked it up in the Margaret's office, and left it fermenting in the garbage can so Margaret would smell it in the morning.

If she had been just middling bad, like on most nights, say she had laughed at James's big feet or poked fun at Big Paul for failing to lose weight or talked about the new girl's freaky fit in her hearing\-- she would have made herself sleep without a pillow. If her behavior was worse, like she'd ratted on someone for sneaking cigarettes (Maida) or shamed someone enough to make them cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose wiped up grape juice with a favorite cashmere sweater (Danny), she would have stripped the bed and made herself lie on the bare stained mattress.

It wasn't until she heard Charlene report at dinner that storm winds were gusting and the wind chill factor was forecast at five degrees below zero that her inner judge declared a trifecta. Bare floor. Open window. Nude.

Stripped down to camisole and bikini pants, she ran through her usual skin care routine, removing her make up and lathering French eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, exfoliating the dead cells from her face with a salt scrub, closing her pores with an astringent that smelled like sulfur and vinegar from the Dead Sea, thinking about how when the cat played with the mouse too long, it was time for atonement.

She'd cracked open as far as it would go at nine PM and by nine-thirty, it had already started to crystalize on the inside of the pane with ice diamonds. Her bare legs and feet felt the cold stealing across the floor and a prickle of skin on the back of her neck rose in anticipation of full body goose bumps.

She dropped her last layer of underwear and knelt at the side of the bed like a cloister penitent about to pray on bare knees. Instead, she settled on her side where she could see the drift of slowly swirling snowflakes chasing the heat away from the room. You made your bed, now lie in it, she told herself.

It was dim and silent. A silver glow from the waning moon reflected off the snow covered fields that led to the Kootenai River and and the pulp mill next to the train tracks. Healing House settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans. She forced herself to keep her eyes open so she could watch the slow progress of the moon creep up the far wall and crawl across the ceiling with a swath of blue light. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.

A whisper of frigid breeze brought up chill bumps up on her legs and arms. Quiet, she ordered herself to stop trembling.

You did this.

You're disgusting.

You're not even here.

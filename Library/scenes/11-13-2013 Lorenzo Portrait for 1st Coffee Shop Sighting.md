Lorenzo Portrait for 1^st^ Coffee Shop Sighting

He was big and red haired. Built like a football player but really tall. Six five? Six six? Usually Lydia liked tall and lean, boys with normal haircuts not a halo of rusty red curls that set off a curly red beard. He looked a little bit like a jack-in-the box puppet that she had as a kid but friendlier. Not likely to fly up and whack her in the jaw which is what happened on her first encounter with the evil box.

What made her interact with him?

He was counting out coins on the tabletop. Methodically separating quarters from dimes and nickels. All the pennies spread out like a pool of copper Lincolns.

\"What are you doing?\" she said from where she sat at the next table over.

He looked around to locate who was talking to him. When he saw it was her, he said, \"I\'m counting.\"

\"I see that. Why?\"

He blinked lake blue eyes. \"To see if I have enough for a cup of coffee.\"

\"Do you?\"

\"No.\"

Lydia didn\'t know what possessed her but she got up and set her untouched coffee next to the neatly piled coins. \"I haven\'t touched it,\" she said. \"Have at it.\"

He rocked back in his chair. He wore a flannel mountain boy \-- mountain giant? \-- shirt that had a tear in the elbow showing some kind of waffle weave undershirt. Not exactly Abercrombie but the blue plaid set off the blue depths of his eyes. He seemed to be about to shake off her offer but then he let the legs of the chair settle forward and said, \"God, I need this.\"

They both laughed. So she sat down.

Haines

The small lichens and masses that had

taken root upon the skull were breaking

down whatever was left of its structure

It seemed to me as I walked away and

turned to view it from a little distance,

that the skull was like a small vessel,

abandoned by captain and crew, rudderless

and [emanated]{.underline}, it was sinking into the moss

and frozen sod. The wet, green sea life

of the tundra washed over the pale wreck

in tiny waves year after year, and sooner

or later, sun, rain and frost would claim

it completely. Farewell.

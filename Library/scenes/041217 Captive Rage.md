041217 Captive Rage

Lydia burbled on and on, egged on by her desire to beat Dani\'s list of crazy, self-focused shit. The two girls were so self-involved, so clueless about anyone else in the room, Old Girl wanted to choke them with the same rope. The problem was there was no rope at Inner Horizons. No rope, no long scarves, no ties for bathrobes, no leather to hold pants up (the boys whined about this incessantly), no lengths of cord longer than a shoe lace. Inner Horizon believed in Velcro as long as it was two inches or less.

Old Girl looked down at lumpy bumpy laces tied a million times and felt a bad case of captive rage coming on. Captive rage was like captor rage, except more vicious. When you had captor rage, there was some dim glimmer of understanding that the night duty or day super or van driver was making \$8 bucks an hour and didn\'t want to be at Inner Horizons any more than you did. But when you got captive rage, all the blame was aimed at yourself.

Every kid at Inner Horizons had met Old Girl on her first day of lock up with the phrase, \"Welcome to You-Da-Ho.\"

Udahoe? Old Girl was stupid enough to ask.

\"No, You-Da-HO.\" A universal correction with the emphasis on the last syllable. \"You da crazy ho who screwed up so bad you got yourself locked up in bum-fuck Coueur D\'Alene, Idaho, with a bunch of crazy fuckers you\'ll never get away from.\"

At the time, she thought it was some lame ass joke until she realized it was so dead on right that it became an ear worm unshakable from her head.

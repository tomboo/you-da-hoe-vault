Lydia & Mormon Kid Start a Friendship

\"No. I don\'t want to do that with you.\"

\"You\'re kidding, aren\'t you?\" asked Lydia, uncertainly. She was starting to wonder if she was losing her touch. Why not? Are you gay?\"

\"No. What makes you say that?\" The boy, Lorenzo\--that name was another weird thing about him \-- looked genuinely curious, like Lydia had called him a circus animal or a giraffe. Something he knew by name but wasn\'t all that familiar with.

"Most guys your age like blow jobs.\"

He frowned. Not with disgust, exactly, more like distaste. As if she\'d used the wrong fork or burped in public.

\"That\'s for after you\'re married,\" he said.

\"You\'re weird, \"she said.

\"Better than selling myself short,\" he said.

\"I\'m not getting this. Your parents kicked you out of your house for being a threat to \-- what\'d you call him \-- Prophet Joseph?\"

He looked away. Took a drink of his Coke and watched the kids at the salad bar loading their plates. \"Deacon. Deacon Joseph,\" he said.

\"What the fuck do you care about following Mormon rules? They kicked you out. Why would you follow some stupid Church rules when it was the Church who broke their own rules?\"

\"You wouldn\'t understand. You weren\'t brought up that way.\"

It occurred to Lydia that she hadn\'t exactly been brought up believing it was her God-given duty to put every cock she encountered in her mouth. It had always seemed like a way to be nice to someone, kind of like sharing a sandwich or drinking from the same straw. Guys liked it. Ergo, Lydia liked it and it made her feel both powerful and important. What was a little sperm juice on her chin compared to the knowledge that you were the one with the superhuman powers that never failed to make them fly?

Lorenzo was gathering up his notebooks and a dog-eared copy of Plato\'s Republic.

\"Oh, you like history?\" Lydia nodded at Plato, the book on top.

\"This is philosophy,\" he said.

\"Oh,\" she said, standing up with him. \"I\'ve got a lot to learn, I guess.\"

He touched a springy curl that had come loose from her headband and tucked it behind her ear. It was such a light and tender touch it made her blink. He\'s just refused her offer of a blow job and now he was touching her?

\"Maybe we could have a coffee on Thursday,\" he said. \"Will you be here?\"

She nodded. Knock me down with a toothpick. Is he asking me on a date? \"I have my English lit class.\"

\"See you then?\" he asked.

\"Ok, I guess.\" Her voice was tentative. A little dubious. She wasn\'t sure she\'d ever been on a coffee date. She was so used to going right to the main event. She felt her heart lift at the unexpected weirdness. The lack of pressure to perform. \"Yes,\" she said. Then, more loudly because he was already passing the salad bar.

\"I\'ll be here.\"

She went outside to the stop sign to wait for the shuttle. She was five minutes ahead of time \-- a miracle for her \-- and she didn\'t even feel the cold of the biting breeze. A coffee date. What do you wear to a coffee date?

> JAMES WAS SUPPOSEDLY WORKING ON HIS IMPACT LETTER. Sisyphus, and his fucking rolling stone.
>
> Reza, uncharacteristically quiet since the night Estie stabbed him, whuffled and sighed. Less than ten minutes after starting, he abandoned his writing entirely in favor of picking at the bandage wrapped around his hand. He had been playing with the conforming gauze until it was so screwed up, it would no longer stay tucked. "Would you do this for me?" he said. "It's driving me crazy."
>
> "Hey, write your own accountability crap. I've got enough problems with my own," said James.
>
> "Not my letter. Help me with the bandage. It won't stay closed."
>
> James got up from his desk. Plopped down heavily on the mattress where Reza was writing propped up by his pillows. Reza stopped and scooted further into the corner. James unwrapped the grimed gauze. It was wrinkled and gray from being worried and picked at.
>
> "Jesus, this is a mess. Quit looking at it or your hand'll get infected."
>
> "Want to see it?"
>
> "Not really."
>
> Reza. Any carbuncle in a storm.
>
> "Okay, fine," James relented. "It'll be easier if we start over."
>
> Released from its orange-stained inner packing, Reza's hand looked like a piece of raw meat. The dark tine marks stood out like fang marks except with three puncture wounds, not two. The skin was warm, swollen with lymph, and puffy.
>
> James touched the back of Reza's hand gently with one finger. "Does that hurt?"
>
> "Like a bitch."
>
> "She really nailed you."
>
> Reza turned his palm up. On his heart line like stigmata from a very weird snake, three oozing wounds. "Man. The fork went all the way through."
>
> "Good thing she's not any bigger or she would have nailed me to the floor, not just the table," Reza said.
>
> James, made sure not to touch the wound and instead, reapplied antibiotic ointment to the packing. He got rid of the wrinkles, straightened the wrap, and tightened the gauze around the wrist to compress it and relieve pain. Then he reset the butterfly clip so it held. "Now quit fucking with it. You need to keep the bacteria out."
>
> "How do you know how to do that?"
>
> "Mom's a doc." James couldn't count the number of times he'd been wrapped expertly after his many childhood scrapes by her neat surgeon's hands.
>
> "Are you going to be a doc?"
>
> "Oh, hell no."
>
> James had no idea what he was going to be if he ever grew up, but the mountain his mother had climbed was so far up in the Himalayas, he couldn't imagine how she got there. "I barely got into USC. Med school would be ridiculous."
>
> Reza blew out, a windy, sad sound. "I know what you mean. My dad thinks I'm going to get into Harvard. He wants me to be an economist like him.
>
> "Parents."They both spoke in unison, as if the misfortune of sharing genetics turned people insane.
>
> "I'm the one who figured out how to make meth without blowing anybody up. I'm not stupid, you know."
>
> "I know," James nodded, and said into the lull. "About the other night... Um.... I wanted to say I was sorry."
>
> "For what?"

"That thing I said? ...you know? At dinner, the night Estie stabbed you?

When I called you 'Monkey Boy?'"

"Was this before Shit-for-Brains? Or after?"

Reza sucked in a breath, a technique James was supposed to use,

according to Josh, to "self-calm" before he blew up.

"Before 'Midget"? Or later, when you called me 'Mosquito?'"

James face reddened, then got hot as Reza continued.

"'Gnat Boy?' 'Mosquito?' 'Talks-A-Lot-But-Says-Nothing?' 'Moron'? 'Motormouth?' 'Gnat's Ass?' Dork-o-Rama?' 'Dingbat?' 'Dweeb?' 'Ratso?'

'Rizzo?' 'Ditzoid?' Are you sure 'Monkey Boy' was on Friday, not earlier in the week?"

Reza's recitation sped up and the temperature in the room sped up the thermometer with him.

"And would you stop calling me Gandhi! How many times do I have to tell you I'm not Indian, I'm Pakistani?"

"Gandhi was a saint," James said, rather diffidently.

"A Hindu saint, maybe. Not to Muslims." Reza crushed his body deeper into the corner as if to avoid touching James. "And why now? Why all that other shit you called me, why apologize for something as white bread as 'Monkey Boy'? Did you wake up in the middle of the night and convert yourself from asshole to Shiva H. Vishnu?"

Reza on a roll, was Reza on a tear. "I just wanted to say I was sorry...."

ALT

"I really wanted to say I was sorry...," James started again, but Reza didn't let him finish.

"You wanted to say you were sorry." Reza emphasized the tense, willfully changing the present to the past, which wasn't what James meant at all. "Does that mean you were sorry then but you're not sorry now?"

"No, stupid." He stopped, wishing he could take back all the names, starting with stupid. He cleared his throat. Said "I meant I am sorry" with a raised voice, in an effort to make himself understood. The loudness of his deep voice int he quiet room seemed to have the effect of making Reza flinch deeper in the corner. He couldn't be afraid of James, could he? All he was doing was sitting on his mattress.

"Why do you always call me names?" Reza asked. " What's wrong with plain old Reza?"

James blinked. "I... uhm.... I didn't think..."

Reza pounced. "That's your problem. You never think about what you say and how it makes me feel. I call you James every damn day and what do you call me? Stink Bug. I shower just as much as you do!"

"I know that." James passed a hand over his lower jaw where the blond hairs were just beginning to stubble. Reza's dark beard was way ahead of James, he noticed. The one place Reza had James beat. He had to shave twice a day to get rid of it.

"You think everything you say is funny, don't you? Stink Bug always gets a big laugh, so you say it again. People laughed when you called me "Monkey Boy," didn't they?"

Another pass over James's paltry stubble. "I don't know," he muttered. "Estie stabbed you then and you were screaming so loud, I didn't hear it."

Reza was now inspecting his wrapped hand like it was some wounded creature. He cradled it protectively in his lap. "And don't even get me started on 'Apu'! You call me Apu all the time. That's worse. I'm not even Indian."

"No, stupid---." James stopped when the word 'stupid' rolled out of his mouth like a fart. Appalled, he wanted to take it back, along with all the other stupid names that apparently rolled out of his mouth just as stupidly the night of the stabbing and before. "I am sorry." His voice was strained. In the silence, the volume was louder than he meant it to be. Reza shrank as far into the corner as he could. A strange thought entered James head: Reza couldn't be afraid of James, could he? All James was doing was sitting near him in the corner of a room.

"Why do you always call me names?" Reza asked. "What's wrong with plain old Reza?"

James blinked. "I... uhm.... I do but I don't think..."

Reza pounced. "That's your problem. You never think about what you say! I call you 'James' or 'Olson' every damn day and you never call me everything but bullshit."

James felt like something was stuck in his throat. "I don't even know your last name. What is it anyway?"

"You'll never be able to spell it. It's Kamaaliaazaad. Seven As. And that's not even a record in Urdu."

"Are you fucking with me?"

"Always. But that's my name." Reza ripped a page out of his notebook and stabbingly wrote it across an entire line.

James counted the syllables. "So, Reza." He gestured to the name and tried to ease things by making joke. "'Apu is easier than that."

"You think everything you say is funny, don't you? 'Apu' gets a big laugh, so you say it again. People laughed when you called me "Monkey Boy," didn't they?"

"I don't know," James muttered. "You were screaming so loud, I couldn't hear it."

"I fucking hate 'Apu'!" Reza shouted.

This was the point in the discussion where things went from normal to Def Con. Reza eeled off the bed, squeezing himself like a brown Houdini through the small space in between the headboard and the dip in the mattress where James had confined him. It was like a contortionist's maneuver, the way Reza had to slip abruptly sideways, and push himself away from James, as if he was untouchable.

"Jesus, James, you are so clueless."

"You said you love the Simpsons! You told me how funny Apu is. How he makes you laugh. I was just kidding!"

"Apu is a stereotype made up by some white guy about people he doesn't know one thing about. Everybody thinks all South Asians run Korean grocery stores. I'm not going to Harvard but I'm not doing that!"

In the doorway where Reza addressed James, he stood straight and solemn as a judge. He threw James a pitying look and said, "Jesus, James. You were there when those assholes yelled at me to go home," Reza muttered. "What, didn't you notice? Or did you forget?"

A couple of weeks ago, James and Reza had been walking down Main Street in Coeur d'Alene when some guy in a pick-up shouted racial slurs at them. Reza didn't notice at first because he was doing that thing where he was writing music on the back of his eyeballs. He was snapping of his fingers and keeping four-four time with his feet to entertain himself.

"Doesn't that make you mad?" James asked after the red necks made their first pass.

"What?"

"You didn't hear those assholes yell at you?"

"No. What'd they want?"

"They called you..." James hesitated. "...the 'N' word."

"A noodge? Better than being called a Paki. "

James shook his head. The only people who still called people "noodges" were either ten-years-old or a hundred.

"They called you a nigger, Reza."

"In London, it would have been 'rag head.' Or 'bloody mop head.'" Reza, born in Britain, had moved to New Jersey when he was twelve. "They're too stupid in Idaho to know what to call me. I'm not a Spic. Not a Jap. Not a Chink . Not even a stinking Injun, which is the bottom of the Idaho heap, I gather."

James said, "Worse, I think."

"At least they didn't call me bowlegged. I hate that."

James had never thought about what a trial it must be to to be Reza. Not black. Not white. Not anything known in know-nothing Idaho except small, strange, suspect. And on top of everything else, clueless.

They crossed the street quickly, making sure the truck didn't coming around to run them down.

James asked Reza "Does that happen to you a lot?"

"Quite a bit," he had said.

Back in the quiet dorm room, James cleared his throat. Time to try again.

Reza held up his hand and stopped his throat clearing. "Thanks for the wrap job, White Boy. Not the apology."

Hoooboy.

A loud knock sounded on their door like a signal. Tap-tap- ppppauuuuuse-RAP. Both Reza and James started at the noise.

Reza opened it to Big Paul. James, expecting Big Paul to invite him to play cards, thought that even Hearts were preferable to this argument.

But Big Paul wanted to see Reza. He said, "Hey, I wrote a new song. Want to hear it?"

Since when did Paul sing? The big autistic kid barely opened his mouth except to eat.

"I wrote one too." Reza grabbed his backpack and scrabbled in the bottom before he pulled out a piece of paper with wandering lines of notes amid trebles and clefs.

"I thought you just wrote on the back of your eyeballs," James said.

"My eyelids, not my eyeballs!" Reza snorted disgust. "I work out my music with my eyes closed. Then I write it down so I remember it, Whitey."

He gave James the finger. Shut the door on James with a sharp snick.

Out in the hallway, through the thin wood of the door, James could hear Reza asking Paul what key he wrote. But in his mind's eye, all James was seeing was Josh. Pink edged palms lined with black skin which were spread in defeat when James ended the family call by hanging up on Mom and Dad. The dial tone still sounded in their ears when Josh remarked, "That went well."

James put his feet up and rested his head against the backboard of Reza's bed. He was used to looking over at Reza's side of the room but he'd never sat on Reza's side and looked at it from his point-of-view

They were both slobs.

Of the two of them, James was the worst.

James had lived in the same walls with Reza for more than a year. A year of being locked up in Idaho -- away from his sister and his parents and his friends -- locked up in rural Idaho in Coeur D'Alene. In Coeur D'Alene, he moved in with a roommate for the first time---that was pretty weird \-- in a narrow room with a low, sloping ceiling he kept cracking his head on. It had one skinny window that was locked on the outside. The sash rose six inches and no more.

James' brown bean bag chair slopped into Reza's desk like a space-eating amoeba. His extra-large exercise ball bumped into Reza's chair. His mattress, extra-long to fit his 6'5" frame, pushed Reza's mattress up against the wall. His hand weights, towels, toiletries, and books took up the whole entire book shelf. The only thing James hadn't colonized was Reza's bed. That funk was all Reza.

When had he starting colonizing Reza's space? James had no idea. And no idea why that realization made him even more depressed. He let the air out of the exercise ball slowly and watched the husk of plastic crumple and sigh to the floor.

He stuffed the plastic into Reza's trash but stopped himself, and then stuffed it into his own trash.

Baby steps.

He was thinking about the blow-up. Wondering how he had set Reza off and what was the moment of the explosion while peripherally aware of the odd perspective from Reza's side of the room.

Reza's mess was contained in a small footprint in the corner. Much of James's crap had colonized the shared space. From Reza's bed, it looked as if James had pushed his roommate deep in the corner until he had no place to go ---unless he folded in on himself.

An extra-long mattress and box springs accommodated James' 6' 5" frame; a big-ass inflated ball allowed him to stretch his back; lacrosse sticks and tennis racket and brand new carbon-fiber snow shoes built bulk and strength; the closet gaped with extra-large clothing and shoes the size of submarines while Reza's smaller clothing was shoved off to the back.

James saw Reza cringing in the corner at his raised voice, in the moment before he made his spring for freedom. James had cluelessly shoved Reza into the corner with his big bulky body and his clueless attitude and clueless assumption that it was Reza's job to make him feel better for apologizing.

No wonder Reza had burst out of the the corner at the first opportunity!

James was more than aware of his own cluelessness; he was slightly nauseated by it. His knee-jerk reaction was to go after Reza to crowd him into compliance. But for once, he thought he knew enough to ignore josh's advice for now about "getting close to him."

Stay in your own lane, James told himself.

Give Reza some space.

0702017 Race Relations

This is how James thought of race. He was raised by two liberal parents. People who were aware and educated if slightly obtuse, like all white people, about black people and what they had to suffer. Just wanting everyone to be color blind didn\'t work. You had to actively seek to make a difference.

\"What would your parents think about you having a black girlfriend?\" Josh asked him one day.

\"As long as she\'s not a drug addict, they wouldn\'t care.\"

\"Sure about that?\" Josh\'s long tented fingers glowed pink around the sides of the dark purple skin on the back of his hands.

\"They never had any problems with my black friends. Half the guys on the team were black.\"

\"Not having problems isn\'t the same as welcoming someone into the family and the gene pool, \" Josh said.

James really had to think about this. Mom and Dad were liberals, big contributors to the Democratic party. Most of their friends were white and moneyed, just like they were. They treated Consuela, the house keeper, and her extended family like their own. They\'d paid to help Consuela get a lawyer when she was having trouble getting a green card. But really, black people weren\'t a big part of their social lives. They worked with them, especially Mom, because she taught at USC med school. At the Christmas party she hosted a couple year\'s back, he remembered a few black residents who ate a lot of food as if they were starving.

Josh was eying him. James realized he\'d been silent a while as he thought about his question.

\"I don\'t know,\" he admitted. \"They always told me to treat people the way I want to be treated.\"

\"It\'s a start,\" Josh said.

\"They\'d be surprised, I think. Or maybe worried?\"

\"Worried how?\"

\"They\'re not stupid. They know how race relations suck in America.\"

\"So they\'d be concerned about how people would treat you if you had a black girl friend? Or are you talking about if she was a wife?\"

\"I just met Rachel. I haven\'t proposed yet!\"

\"Think about it. Maybe you should ask your parents. See what they say.\"

James had a sudden hollow feeling in his stomach. \"Black lives matter,\" he said, seeing a slogan on a tee shirt that the girl in the passenger seat had been wearing.

\"What?\" Josh\'s eyes held his.\'

\"That girl... the one I gave a ride to. She was wearing it on her shirt.\"

\"A Black Lives Matter tee shirt?\"

\"No, a sweat shirt.\" James remembered seeing white letters turn red with blood.\"

\"You look like you\'ve seen a ghost,\" Josh said. \"What are you thinking about?\"

James was out of his seat, scrabbling for his backpack and propelling himself toward the door as he said, \" I gotta go. It\'s late.\"

Who knew that the mention of a tee shirt would kick start his heart rate and make him sweat with sour fear. Black Lives Matter had opened up Pandora\'s Box and all he really wanted was to slam it closed.

\"Having a black girl friend isn\'t the same as having a black wife,\" Josh said. \"Different order of magnitude.\"

\"I just met the girl. Give me a few days before I have to propose!\"

\"Do you parents have any black friends?\" Josh asked in a different session.

\"Some. A few.\"

\"Close friends? Or just acquaintances?\"

James remembered a young resident that his mother really liked. A black woman from France. Or was it Nigeria. \"Mom does. I don\'t know about Dad.\"

\"All I\'m saying is that people tend to be friends with people like themselves. If you\'re white, your friends tend to be white. They make the same amount of money. Go to the same schools.\"

\"What about you?\" James asked. \"Do you have any white friends?\"

\"You,\" Josh said.

\"Oh hell no. I don\'t count.\"

\"Why not?\"

\"I\'m a fuck-up! Besides, I\'m your patient. Isn\'t there some kind of rule against that.\"

\"OK,\" Josh said equitably. \"I was making a joke. Besides you look like you could use a friend today.\"

\"Oh go to hell, Mr. Professional.\"

\"See you Tuesday, Ghost,\" was Josh\'s reply.

\"Who says a doctor and a patient can\'t be friends? Where\'d you get that idea?\"

\"From you,\" James said. \"There\'s some old thing about the therapist-client bond, you said.\"

\"If I was your friend instead of your doctor, I\'d tell you the same thing.\"

\"What\'s that?\"

\"Sooner or later, we\'re going to have to talk about the girl in the Black Lives Matter tee shirt.\"

\"Just not today,\" James said tightly.

Josh sighed. \"OK, Ghost. How about on Wednesday at next session?\"

\"Maybe,\" said James, meaning never.

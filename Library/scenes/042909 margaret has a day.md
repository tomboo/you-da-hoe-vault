042909 Margaret has a day

What a day. If Margaret had her way, she\'d bring back corporal punishment and start with the brat who clogged the toilet in the boy's wing with a hand towel. Who would try to flush a *towel* down the toilet? Margaret didn't even want to think about what was on the towel. The shit these kids thought up.

If they spent half their time devoting their smarts to fixing their issues instead of acting out, they\'d all be healed. But then, of course, Margaret wouldn\'t have her shitty low-paying job as Day Supervisor at Inner Horizons. Was this the most dysfunctional, worst run psychiatric treatment facility in the country? That\'s what she\'d overheard one of the therapists telling some colleague on the private office phone while Margaret filled out reports. It sounded like Ian, the therapist, was angling for a job with whoever he was talking to.

Through the relight in the office door Margaret could half hear the girl's process group going on in the living room. It sounded like an angry swarm of bees. Deanna sagged in the center of the couch, with Leia to one side of her and Danny on the other. Between a rock and a hard place. That Danny was the meanest girl Margaret had ever met. Danny and Leia were involved in some kind of devilment against Deanna, Margaret could tell. Deanna had hit a milestone in yesterday\'s weigh-in: 285 pounds. Quite an achievement since entering the program at 345. Wouldn\'t you think those skinny girls would pat Deanna on the back for all her hard work? Hell, no, Margaret had overheard Danny ask Deanna now she could stand tosee herself in the mirror (Margaret wrote her up immediately) and she knew they called her cellulites, She just hadn\'t been ask to catch them doing it. Between the two of them, they had poor Deanna afraid to pass them in the hallway. It was like the poor girl\'s fat cells drove them crazy.

If Margaret had her say, which she didn't (who listened to the voice of common sense in a gaggle of Ph. Ds?) she'd\--. Oh Christ.

Margaret was on her feet, pen tossed to the winds, and in the middle of the cat fight before she finished her thought. Danny was yanking at Deanna\'s hair and Deanna\--amazing! she has a temper! - clawed at Darny\'s face with (unfortunately) fingernails that were chewed to the quick. Still, Deanna had managed to bloody Danny\'s nose\--she must have gotten off the first punch\--but now Danny was popping her viciously on the ear with a closed fist. Margaret registered the street fighter\'s move, while she hauled Danny backwards still kicking and flailing. Darlene, the therapist on duty, sat down on Deanna. Margaret wasn\'t quite quick enough to to stop Danny\'s foot from connecting with Deanna\'s pillowy belly. Cheap shot! The little vixen. Margaret shook the skinny Danny like a rag doll. \"Stop it! Get control of yourself!\" she cried, over the sound of Deanna\'s blubbering.

She didn\'t have time to ask what started the fight because Reza, the one with the anxiety problem, started throwing up on the carpet. Margaret had just had it cleaned last week and now he was blowing chunks of barely digested eggs and oatmeal onto the back of the conch and the floor.

By the time they got everybody off to their various therapists for emergency sessions (she made the little shit Leia scrub the couch with Anti-Icky-Poo. \"Isn\'t this the stuff you use on dog poop?\" Leia asked. \"It\'s all the same,\" Margaret answered) it was time to make her Status calls to twenty parents about their darlings\' \"progress in daily living.\" Margaret wished fervently she could tell someone how she herself was progressing in daily living. Was that job at the Tasty Freeze still open? It paid a dollar an hour less than Day Supervisor at Healing House (Heller House is what Margaret called it when she talked to Hank, her truck driver husband, in the middle of the night.) He had hurt his back lifting something stupid so the really needed her income. Joss --ones that paid a living wage didn't grow o

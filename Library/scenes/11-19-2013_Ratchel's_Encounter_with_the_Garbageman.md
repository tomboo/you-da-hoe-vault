Rachel\'s Encounter with the Garbage man

Clank. Bam!

Rachel started up like she\'d been shot. \"What the hay?\" Then she settled back in the warm sheets and put the pillow over her head. Why did they have to pick up the garbage at the crack of dawn? She looked at the neon numbers of the clock. 5:15.

Old Girl groaned. \"It\'s part of treatment. It\'s called garbage torture.\"

Rachel muttered \"shit\" to herself. She was seeing light at the periphery of her eyes. The headache wasn\'t there yet but she could feel the advance of the vise that would grip her between her temples and make her throw up everything inside her.

She heard Old Girl get up and pad to the bathroom. Double shit. The second the thought of throwing up entered her consciousness, her mouth started to fill with saliva.

She\'s put their garbage cans out in the hall, per the housekeeping rules. What else could she throw up in while Old Girl was on the toilet? Her cowboy hat? No. The fluid gathered in her mouth. Hurling was imminent. In a panic, she jumped out of bed with an Aurora Borealis crackling behind her eye balls and stumbled into the hall.

It was freezing. The back door was wedged open and Rachel bolted to the open door and ran out barely registering the cold on her bare feet.

The contents of her stomach thundered out of her. A hot foul stream of orange flecked vomit -- last night\'s carrot snack? -- splattered the white grainy snow in front of her.

Finally, the hand gripping her stomach let up and she spit to clear the vomit from her mouth. She straightened up and pulled down the underpants that had crept up her butt when she was bent over in her sleep tee shirt. She was glad no one was out in the yard to see her with her ass hanging out and retching like a dog. Her feet felt like ice blocks. Better get inside before frost bite set in, she was thinking as she turned toward the back door.

Wha--!? The door was locked. She rattled the knob. Naturally, it fucking locked. To keep the inmates in not to keep people out she thought resentfully. Purple and pink light haloed the tree lined ridge as she picked her way in her freezing feet along the girl\'s wing of bedrooms towards the front door. She'd have to ring the door bell. Whoever the Duty was would have to let her in.

She supposed she was going to get a demerit for being outside but what else could she do? Throw up in her bed? She hadn\'t down that since her fits started when she was six.

A low growl or maybe a groan -- something that sounded inhuman -- made the hair on the back of her neck stand up. The big rusty truck that substituted for a normal garbage truck was parked at an angle in the front driveway.

A very dirty, greasy haired man was staring at her. Was that where the moaning sound came from? It had cut off when she came opposite. The smell of something rotten rolled off him in waves.

\"Hello\... \" she stammered. \"I\'m locked out.\"

He didn\'t say anything. Just stared. It took her a second to realize what he was staring at. She was naked under the tee shirt except for bikini underpants and her boobs were poking out of the cotton like twin headlamps.

She turned her back to him and leaned on the bell. She could feel his dirty eyes on her back side and she started pounding on the door with the hand that wasn\'t poking the bell.

It seemed like forever before Charleen, the night Duty, flipped the dead bolt and opened the door with a questioning expression. Rachel pushed past her and slammed the door shut with a shudder.

\"What in the world?\" Charleen looked rumpled and she had crumbs of sleep in her eyes and a wrinkle across her face from whatever she\'d been sleeping on.

\"I had to throw up, \" Rachel said. \"Old Girl was in the bathroom. I couldn\'t wait.\"

Charleen, not quickest on the uptake under the best circumstances couldn\'t seem to put the story together.

\"You were outside puking? It\'s 10 degrees out.\"

Rachel\'s feet, which had lost all feeling chose that minute to telegraph a thousand pins stabbing her soles.

\"Who\'s that weird guy outside? He saw me.\"

Charleen glanced through the relight. The truck rumbled past on the circular drive, emitting a cloud of black exhaust against the pink and blue dawn. \"Him? That\'s Rusty Barrow. He lives out at the dump.\"

\"Oh.\" The aura behind Rachel\'s eyes had dimmed. The dark wave of migraine was pressing on her head and she could barely see. Her knee buckled under her and the last thing she saw was Charleen\'s dingy eyes crinkling in concern.

Rusty Has a Vision.

Sometimes he couldn\'t sleep. He didn\'t know what shook him out of the dark and he made himself get up because he couldn\'t go back to sleep and he\'d lie in blankets and toss and turn like a packrat in a shredded nest. 4:30 AM. The witching hour.

He got up and heated up yesterday\'s coffee on the stove. He pulled on his overalls, stiff with grease on the outside, but soft and familiar as an old rag next to his privates.

He fired up the [\_\_\_]{.underline}. (look up \_\_ model of pre 67s haul truck?) and looked at the outside thermometer he\'d found in somebody\'s junk and hung on the trailer next to the screen door. 3o. Colder than a witches tit and more cold on the way.

If he got his pick-ups done early, he could strip the Buick he\'d bought off Nelson at the food store for parts and see if he could get some cash for them at the dealer shop. Pete Petty, who ran the parts department didn\'t mind subbing used parts when people were being charged for new. Petty paid pretty good for whatever Rusty brought him and he paid in cash.

He\'d just about finished loading the bins at Hazey\'s Nut House and was trying to decide between a donut stop downtown or a cinnamon roll as big as his head at the Truck Stop on I-90 when he heard the sound of retching on the side of the building.

He peered around the corner just as the sky was changing from night blue to a girly pink. He couldn\'t believe what he was seeing.

She had her back to him. One hand help back a long pony tail of blond hair form her face and she was bent over at the waist. Legs that went all the way to there. The pink globes of a perfect ass. Striped bikini panties rising up to settle in a dark and beckoning vee.

Holy Christ. He could hear her retching but all he could focus on was the pink skin bent over like a bitch offering herself to a mutt.

When she stopped puking and started to pick her way along the building towards him he ducked back around the corner and waited by the truck door to see where she was going. Maybe she wanted a ride.

Rusty licked his dry lips and imagined the line of flesh running from her bare feet to the bottom of the white tee shirt as she sat next to him in the cab. He\'d never had a woman in the truck. One with poky little tiites and a bare ass put Hustler magazine to shame, which is why he couldn\'t take his eyes off her as she came on her tippy toes past him.

She stared at him. Blond honey colored hair flying over her shoulders. Eyes dark and wide in a white face.

\"Hello,\" she said and Rusty couldn\'t hear the rest of the sentence. Her tits were jutting out like two stoplights. All he could hear was a roar in his ears. His hard on was a spear sharp enough to split her.

When the front door slammed shut, all the air whooshed out of him. Love, he thought. It hit him like a hammer.

**Insert D**: She was wearing one of Old Girl\'s tee shirts. All hers were in the laundry because she hadn\'t realized you had to put your dirty clothes out in the hall with your garbage on Thurs. if you wanted it to be washed.

She remembered looking at the shirt and wrinkling up her nose at it.

\"Where\'d you get this? It\'s disgusting.\"

Old Girl laughed. \"Beggars can\'t be choosers. Don\'t you like what the Stocks man Bar has to offer?\"

On the front the shirt read, \"Liquor up front.\" The back said, \"Poker in the rear.\"

\"What can I say? Montana humor, \" Old Girl shrugged. \" One of my friends gave it to me. She\'s at the U of M in Missoula.\"

**C-** She didn\'t think about the shirt until she slammed the door shut on the staring man.

**D**-Charleen was saying \" That\'s Rusty Barrow. He handles garbage and runs the dump.\"

The black eyes like holes in the man\'s face had been fixed on her bra-less chest. Liquor up front. The thought made her shudder. Did he have time to read the words on her back -- Poker in the rear -- before the door banged shut? She hoped not. She really fervently hoped not. But she knew he had.

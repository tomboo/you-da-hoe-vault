FIVE

AFTER HIS WIFE, ALMA, LEFT him for a horse whisperer, Dr. August Sanders Hazey often found himself staring at the black and white photo on his office wall. The portrait from the early 20^th^ Century showed three farmers dressed up on their way to a party. He wished he could go with them.

A neat stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical insurance premiums needed to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the dour but ambitious head therapist, remained unread. Unsigned.

Dr. Hazey checked the clock again. Another hour before he could reasonably down another muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck for his session with Rahel Bronfmann nee---What? The Grosse Point heiress to the Bronfman alcohol fortune had divorced, remarried and then divorced again in the year and a half since Lydia Bronfmann came to the program. How the woman remembered her own name was a mystery.

His plan was to assure Rahel about Lydia's Bronfmann's progress, which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl, a cutter and a bulimic, had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. Lydia had four write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct. The rest of her file was stuffed with carefully coded phrases: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (i.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessening (keeping her under lock-and-key worked, to a point). "Recommend single room" (can't get along with Essie Lattimer, the roommate).

What he could say definitively say about Lydia Bronfmann was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were never late.

Parents like Rahel Bronfmann nee \_\_\_? came to Dr. Hazey to be reassured. He'd tried passing off this duty to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene had a problem with brutal honesty. She had no idea how to be reassuring without outright lying. When parents met with Darlene, she of the dour and sour personality, there went another monthly check that should have gone to Inner Horizons and ended up being written to the new Anorexia Unit at McLain, associated with Harvard, or to Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu where lucky patients got to surf. God, it was a dog-eat-dog-with-anxieties-world.

Hazey had long ago mastered the trick of hitting the right balance between avuncular reassurance and avoiding the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact almost every adolescent he'd ever met toyed with sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

By the time Rahel Bronfman Fiat (soon to be ex-Fiat, Lydia said) sailed into Dr. Hazey's office, she was thirty minutes late. She waved a vaguely dismissive hand at him, simultaneously air-kissing Lydia on both cheeks. It flashed through Hazey's mind that perhaps the girl's mother missed her cheeks by an inch because she really couldn't tell if she was there.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A flutter of an eyelid communicated that Rahel hated the mop of short black curls that Lydia had stopped straightening soon after filing a formal complaint that she couldn't find a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "It's so... informal." Rahel's voice was low, with the Detroit scrubbed out of it by either good schools or a voice coach.

Her mother smiled at her daughter with her delicate nose a touch too high. From the grim expression on Lydia's face, she seemed to be thinking about shoving Rahel's false eyelashes up her cosmetically enhanced nostrils. She had two of them, didn't she? Two roads to hell, she would think.

Rahel was a petite, dark-haired woman, a perfect clone of her daughter or, Hazey supposed, vice versa. Lydia, arms crossed on the couch next to her mother, was also tiny but rounded in that childlike way while her mother was tight and lean without an ounce of softness. Hips, narrow as a teenager, with calves like slip knots above excellent chiseled ankles. Clearly, Rahel's workout routine was more military than the Marines.

Lydia's mother's first concern was whether her daughter had put on any weight. "Lyd has a tendency to fat, like I do," Mrs. Bronfmann said, patting a wiry haunch that was as flat as a Greyhound.

Though the woman *was* attractive in a feral way. When she laid a hand on Hazey's arm---he'd made the mistake of pulling his wing back chair close to her---he felt like a cream puff awaiting her sharp teeth. "I hope you're helping my little girl," she said, her voice deep and throaty with concern. "Lydia's all I have."

"Rahel," Lydia said, "Dr. Hazey isn't my therapist. That's not his area."

Rahel said, "You're not being treated by the Head of the Program? Is that what you're saying?"

"I asked for a woman therapist," Lydia said. "You know. Because we get along so well." To this enigmatic statement, she gave Rahel a bland and sugary smile.

Hooboy.

When Hazey tried to probe gently about why Rahel didn't join the weekly calls for Lydia's family therapy, she said airily, "I've been out of the country" as if phones and Skype were yet to be invented.

"Even young adults can feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their therapy," he said.

"Did she say something about me?" Rachel cried. "I'm a good mother!"

Hazey took the hint and smoothly deflected Rahel's claim, saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfmann---your father? --- is the paternal figure in Lydia's life." Clearly, the key issue between mother and daughter wasn't going to be solved in a 45-minute conversation between Lear Jet refuelings.

"It's so good you're here. Lydia was very surprised when we told her about your visit," Hazey said. This was code for Lydia's crying jag and refusal to meet with her mother until she extorted an art class at NICC out of them, though she wasn't ready for that level of freedom. "Would you two like some time to yourself? I can step out of the room."

Both Rahel and Lydia looked at Hazey like he was going to abandon them in the middle of a fire storm. "No" Lydia cried, at the same time as Rahel was standind, saying, "No, no, Dr. Hazey. I'm only here to say hello and drop off Lydia's birthday present. You know she just turned 18 this week."

"Last week," Lydia said. "Mom and I have birthdays in the same month." Lydia smiled a sugary smile when she added "Only now Mom is 17 and I'm older than she is. It's great when you can make your birthdays run backwards."

The conversation went down hill after that. Less than fifteen minutes after the start of the meeting, the clack of Rahel's departing heels jackhammering in Hazey's overloaded brain. God, he needed that muscle relaxant. He absolutely couldn't. He had to control himself. He had to stay awake for his four o'clock appointment with Old Girl.

He called Darlene and told her about the disastrous encounter with Lydia's mother., off loading the job of triage to his next-in-command. Then he laid back in his reclining chair and contemplated the young farmers on the way to their merriment. Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, the only regular patient he still saw was Old Girl. He'd had to drop all his other long-term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of the administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections?

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her. He supposed Lydia Bronfmann would be amazed. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep Old Girl on his crowded schedule though it was hell on his schedule to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include the only patient who made him laugh. Old Girl continually surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. And if he didn't get through to her, he was afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to jolt the girl out of her suicide ideation. She seemed to be responding to a new cocktail of antidepressants but suicide had been a part of her identity so long, he couldn't seem to break her death wish. It was like she'd been on the path to her own destruction for so long that the walls had built up over her head while the path she walked cut deep into granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair she could barely see the stars above her.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit heel. He was also lazy. And unproductive. And he really, really wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for a pick-me-up because he was a professional and he did care, even he mostly didn't act like it.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. He couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a healthy young woman would wear dry wooly scraps of hair like a rag bag mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with nine weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her sexuality and she buried it in unisex clothing and matted hair that looked like desiccated snakes.

Didn't she want a boy friend? Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horizons from becoming a bed hopping swap fest. But maybe he should make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way than sex with one of her peers? That boy from Malibu---Justin? Jamison? James?---he was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing a woman with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a reason for the No Fishing Off the Company Dock rules. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at NICC now that she had finished the Intensive program and was now taking community college classes . If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought.

The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the muscle relaxants.

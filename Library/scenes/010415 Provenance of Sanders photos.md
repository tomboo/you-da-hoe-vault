010415 Provenance of Sanders photos

Hazey had inherited the Sanders photos from a shoestring uncle, who'd had a son emprisoned by the Nazis for left wing activities. The son died in '44, just before the war ended, according to Hazey's father's patchy version of family history, while the photographer, whom Hazey was named for (thanks August) vaguely remembered meeting as a child. This old uncle had escaped the Nazis by moving to a farm near Cologne. All the photo negatives were protected by the estate, and the prints Hazey owned weren't printed by Sanders himself; still they were immensely valuable. When the estate finally located him and they sent him three cases of black-and-white images in white sleeves, his first reaction was, "Damn, what am I supposed to do with these?"

Of all the photographs he'd inherited from Uncle Sanders, Hazey liked the one with the three farmers on the way to a dance the best. The three young men on a country road looked so natty and hopeful, dressed in their Sunday best in order to catch the eye of some village girl, he supposed. They all carried big hand-carved walking sticks that looked like they doubled as cudgels if they ran into trouble. What did trouble look like to a 19^th^ Centertury dorf-man walking to a village party at dusk? A pig escaped from a neighbors' sty? A cow wandering out of its byrne? It sure as hell didn't look like the abject, hunched figure of Alex Freeman, the idiot therapist who'd had sex with his patient, Lydia Brauerman. Alex had just said, in justification, "She has nymphomania. It was important to teach her about establishing safe boundaries!"

Hazey had no trouble contemplating how the safe boundary between innocent hand-holding and getting Alex's dick into Lydia's mouth had gone down. If he could go off to a dance instead of firing another excellent therapist run afoul of Lydia, he'd take one of those walking sticks and beat Alex himself.

"You know I have to fire you," Hazey said.

The man nodded, too sunk in self-disgust and sorrow to argue. "I thought she was really getting the idea. Then she unzipped my\--."

Hazey held his hand up. He really didn't want to know. "Just quit. Today. Hand in your resignation letter by end of day and I won't take it any further. Go back to Boston where you belong."

Alex looked at him like he couldn't believe his luck. At that instant, Hazey himself didn't know why he didn't report the asshole for breaking a patient's trust and grossly illegal behavior that anywhere else would get his psychiatry licence revoked. Hazey was thinking about those farmers on the wall who were taking their cudgels to the village dance. He would warn the next therapist who got assigned to Lydia to carry a big stick and keep his little one in his pants. Female. That was it. Lydia obviously had to be assigned to a woman.

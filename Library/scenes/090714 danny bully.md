090714 danny bully\
\
Danny was a tall athletic girl (bulimic, naturally) and crazy. Good at volleyball where she had a natural spike that would break someone\'s neck if it got away from her. Everything about her was spiked. Narrow, glacial eyes, straight blonde hair that stood up about 2 1/2 inches from her scalp, chiseled biceps from doing one-armed push-ups every day . Old Girl had learned to stay out of her orbit early on. She gathered a coterie of sycophants around her like Reza, the meth addicted motor-mouth who acted as her and force her she could dominate any gathering. Even the counselors were afraid of her.\
\
She was getting out six weeks ahead of schedule because either of her parents had run out of money or Dr. Hazey he had decided she was too dangerous to have around.\
\
The problem was, once they announce she was \"graduating\" she was untouchable. nobody wanted to do anything to risk being killed for fucking up her departure. It was safer to avoid her bullshit with the promise of being free of her cruelty in only a few days.\
\
\
Feeling slightly nauseated or maybe it was empty -- at her inability to stop the bullying, Old Girl started picking up plates. Somebody might as well pick them up to avoid them getting smashed in the mayhem.\
\
She butted one hip into the swinging door to the kitchen and stopped at the site of Danny burying her face and a lemon custard pie that Margaret had made to celebrate Danny\'s graduation.\
\
The kitchen was quiet except for slurping, sucking sounds that Danny was making. Danny stood in profile to Old Girl, her blonde hair held away from her face which was partially submerged in the pie pan. When she met Old Girl\'s eyes, her eyebrows and eyelashes were dotted with clumps of whipped cream.\
\
\"Hey,\" Old Girl set the stack of dirty plates down next to the sink. \"What the fuck? That\'s for everybody!\"\
\
Danny stuck her tongue into the custard and lapped at it, industriously as she swallowed pie filling and creamy glop and hoovered in large globs of crust without seeming to chew. It had only been 30 seconds, give or take, since FC stabbed Reza with the fork. Old Girl could still hear Reza blubbering and whimpering in counterpoint to the commands of Darlene and Margaret to Etsy to let go. Yet the pie for a dozen people was more than half gone.\
\
\"You\'re sick!\" Old Girl cries as Danny eats on and on while Reza whimpers softly in the distance.\
\
\"Isn\'t everybody?\" Danny looked at Old Girl with a greasy heard of yellow dripping from her cheek. \"why do you think we are locked up here? You\'re just as fucked up as the rest of us.\"\
\
\"I\'m not!\" Old Girl cried. \"I\'d never hurt somebody like you do.\"\
\
\"You just did,\" Danny said, using one hand to scoop a cream into her mouth.\
\
\"I didn\'t do anything, you bitch!\"\
\
\"That\'s right,\" Danny said. \"You didn\'t do a damn thing.\" Her expression was flat and lifeless as a corpse.\
\
Years later, Old Girl would still remember the emptiness of the true psychopath inside Danny. It made her back out of the room, afraid to turn away, and every night, she put a desk chair under the doorknob before she went to sleep.

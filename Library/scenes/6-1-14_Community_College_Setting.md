Community College Setting

If you were used to the soaring cathedral at Princeton and the gothic buildings with gargoyles and slates roofs and steps worn soft by thousands of footsteps, then Northern Idaho Community College campus looked like one of the maintenance garages out back.

The main hub of the college was a three story box. It didn\'t look like an institution of learning at all--if you\'d walked by it as Rachel did the first day when she was trying to match the address she\'d been given with anything that looked like an institution of higher learning, well, you\'d probably walk right past it.

It was like the ermine tippets and long gowns and [masterboards]{.underline} with their complicated system of tassels had been stripped down to board shorts and Hoodies. Education with a little e? No even less than that. A random assortment of classes that you had to fight to find the learning in.

Rachel was underwhelmed at her first sight of Northern Idaho Community College. She didn\'t expect gothic cathedrals and gargoyles and slate roofs but then she didn\'t really expect an assortment of faceless, featureless boxes that reminded her of Kmart than an institution of higher learning. In Coeur d\'Alene, higher learning only went as high as the 3 story NICC hub, a concrete box with concrete hallways, concrete walls and professors who wore board shorts and concrete colored hoodies to class.

Rachel had been so thankful to learn that she wasn\'t going to be on lockdown, for the first 6 months, like 90% of the kids who came to the program but would be allowed to take classes right away.

She passed the Hub building twice, before she realized she was at the address she\'d written on her notebook. If that was the Hub--this bland gray box without a single distinguishing feature--where were the [spokes]{.underline}? As far as she could tell NICC was the size of one of the North Western\'s dorms in its entirety.

Rachel, who\'d gotten early acceptance at Princeton right about the time she got pregnant, so NICC was a poor replacement. She didn't\' expect a cathedral with gargoyles and slate roofs but for God\'s sake a 3 story box that looked like a Princeton maintenance building? She\'d passed it twice, looking for the address she\'d written on her notebook. She\'d been looking forward to taking classes but what if she\'d already learned everything there was to know when she lost early acceptance to the Ivy League?

[The Dump:]{.underline}

The dump was one quarter flea market and three-quarters gaping hole that was constantly being churned up and turned under. It smelled of rust and rot and an indefinable burned stuff. Rusty noticed kids holding their hands over their noses but the smell was so familiar he couldn\'t even smell it, except for one time in grade school when he couldn\'t figure out which jacket was his, his nose led him right to it. How could you not smell something forever on then.

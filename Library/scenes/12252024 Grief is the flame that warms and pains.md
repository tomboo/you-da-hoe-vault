12252024 Grief is the flame that warms and pains

My thoughts are filled with grief thinking of five years ago in Sacramento with Nick when he was so sick with depression and despair. There is no expiration date for feelings of grief and I want to accept them and move through them today.

Grief and I are a pair, she thinks, forged together by its fire. She's unwilling to give it up because it means her family lives in her like a flame that both warms her and pains her in equal measure.

12302024 Hazed tells OG to talk to her mom

Mad cried yesterday saying she wished she could talk to Nicky to help herself. I said, "Talk to him anyway. I do."

"People already think I'm crazy, I'm not doing that," she said.

"I don't care if they think I'm crazy, I'll never stop talking to him. I know he's listening," was my response.

I wish she could comfort herself by keeping Nicky with her in her imagination. It hurts no one. It helps me go on. It keeps the faith that our dead are only dead in matter, not in their meaning.

I wonder if I should write an essay for publication on what I wish I had done when Nick told me he had treatment-resistant depression.

I'm not a doctor; I'm educated by loss. Riven by it, so something of an expert having come out the other side reassembled --- just not truly whole.

01022025 Progression of OG from Susan Eliza suicidal ideation

I started out thinking of OG in terms of my rowing friend, Susan Eliza, who was stricken by suicidal impulses from the time she was about six years old. She told me she promised her daughter she wouldn't killed her --- "I promised her I wouldn't! " --- maybe that's where I got the wrongheaded illusion that Nick's promise to live was possible when depression was stronger than he was. My heart went out to Susan Eliza but back then, I had nothing but a rational, arms-length experience with treatment-resistant depression.

Now that it's dark heart has mingled with my own, I see my Nick in OG and vice-versa.

All my love for Nick poured into making OG real to the reader. As Dr. Kilfoyle, Nick's psychiatrist, told us, Nicky was such easy boy to love. I hope I've made OG an easy girl to love because she's my easy Nick and my prickly Madeleine all rolled up in one complicated and unique character.

01052025 Idaho sign in the rearview mirror

OG listens to Carly chatter and natter on about the truck driving life. Exciting places like Peoria and Duluth. How great it is to always know where her husband's because --- here, she pat-pat-pats Ken's big silent knee--- "he's right here." At that moment, the Western Star rig chugs past a sign that marks the Idaho state line.

An image of a different green highway sign that said, "Leaving Montana" came to her. It was within throwing distance of an older, weathered sign that looked like a hillbilly cut it out of the back of his woodshed in the shape of the state of Idaho. She saw it sticking out of straw-colored thicket of weeds when Uncle David and Aunt Peggy were driving her to Inner Horizons. By that point in the long trips, she hadn't said a word for hundreds of miles and all that she can remember thinking was how much she wanted to die.

"Look, Angie, we're almost there," Aunt Peggy said brightly, "Only 74 miles to go."

Miles to go before I sleep/in woods snowy dark and deep" is how she's been misquoting Frost for the last 1300 miles as if oblivion was the only thing to look forward to.

"The Idaho sign looks like a big bear came out of the woods and chomped it off at the top, she said to Clary, who was fortifying herself with another donut before she went deep into the risk of hemorrhoids for long distance truckers.

"I would have thought accidents were a bigger risk," OGZ said politely.

"Oh, no, honey. Piles are the worst. Well, I suppose after a pileup, but seriously, you can't imagine how hard it is to to be able to sit on your butt with this kind of job. Show her your whoopee cushion, Ken. It's a life saver."

Ken's eyes stayed glued to the road. "I'm driving, honey." He rolled his eyes at OG with a grin, saying more to her about the life of a married long distance married trucker for all those miles than anything.

The green metal Idaho state line sign was in the far distance by the time OG realized that Youdaho was behind her and Washington, her old home and hopefully her new one with Aunt \_\_\_\_\_ was up ahead of her.

"My name is Angela," she said. "They used to call me OG but Angela is the name Mom and Dad gave me." Might as well start as she meant to go on, something Mom used to say, but the old Angela didn't understand it until the moment she admitted she was the new Angela.

020419 Rewrite Fork Stabbing by OG

After breakfast, OG overheard Margaret complain to Darlene that she was at the end of her rope with Gretchen. The spinach argument from a higher plane.

In Illinois, you could be at your my wit's end or occasionally up to your eyeballs or even up to your ass in alligators but the Idaho version was new to her. It wasn't until dinner that day when she learned its utility.

The long day, the enclosed space, bodies piled up on top of each other, the constant sniping, the bickering, the sophomoric jokes, the papers and parcheesi pieces and Twister plastic and People magazines underfoot, Estie's bovine calm and her pig-snuffling breath -- in addition to scrambling her brains, the accident had rearranged her septum -- plus the cliques that claqued around the room while Dani and and her posse formed a saber-toothed army against the fat girl, ate up OG's supply of patience.

When James said, "Pass the meat, Monkey Boy," a flash of pain passed over Reza's face but OG was concentrating on Estie who was staring at the meatloaf with mute anguish. Please, please, please, pass me the platter, her close-set piggy eyes and her saliva wet drooling doggy mouth and her absolute dumb animal inertness communicated, like an dog who'd been beaten not to beg but couldn't control his hunger.

The rope that OG had been spooling out during treatment abruptly snapped.

Her hand shot out. OG pressed down with all her might, feeling the little pop of ulna shifting slightly under radius. The platter halted in front of Estie.

"Here!" OG cried over a squeaky "hey!" from Reza. "Feed yourself! No one's going to do it for you!"

Reza was trying to wrestle his arm away but OG was leaning over him with a longer reach and twenty extra pounds, not to mention the the righteous leverage of the newly engaged, now that she wasn't trying to hold her end of the rope while someone else stuffed it down her throat.

Reza cried, "Crazy bitch!"

Estie's eyes were bright and very moist. She raised the serving fork up and drove it into the back of Reza's hand.

"Eeeeeeeee!"

Reza's scream broke through the chitter-chatter.

Estie swung her big bulk again OG and knocked her aside by throwing her considerable weight over Reza's whole arm. Both hands were double gripped like piledrivers, as she forced the fork inexorably into the tabletop.

Plates and platters flew.

Bodies jumped up. Crashed into each other. Estie and Reza, now splayed flat on the table, were kicking and rolling on and food was flying while Reza howled "fuckfuckfuck" at the top of his lungs whilte twisting and flailing tin an effort to throw off Estie's weight. Darlene and Gretchen ran in to the dining room from opposite doors; Dani's high, hyena-pitched laughter, pitched slightly lower in a continuous "ya-yaya-ya-ya" sound somehow ignited James, who had backed away from Reza, but when he tried to muscle Estie's grip from the fork, Reza screamed louder, shouting, "It hurts! Don't! Don't!" and he hesitated and finally let go in the face of Reza's panicked howls. By this time everyone at the dinner table was up and out of the chairs and yelling.

OG took the opportunity to melt away from the fracas. She backed into the kitchen door and stood panting at the sink, while her heart rate rocketed straight into the stratosphere.

OG was looking out at the night yard in order to calm herself. The soft blanket of snow from the storm looked peaceful. The sky had cleared to a dark, matte black. The snow, blue white in the shadows, glowed golden where the lights of Healing House caressed it. It looked so still and silent, compared to the cacophony in the room next door, so silent she could almost imagine walking out in it and letting the quiet envelop her. She was feeling a great burst of warmth, like she'd run a full length marathon when all she had done was act for Estie. She felt preternaturally calm. She'd let go of the rope she'd been hanging on to. She'd leaped for Reza's arm, like leaping from one side of a high cliff over a great precipice of non-involvement. She could still feel Reza's thin, wiry arm muscles. The way the fragile bones cracked when he twisted and tried to throw her off. Estie looked so happy, gratitude like deep pools of peace in her brown eyes, which were ordinarily placid and blank but in that moment, alive with interest and cunning life. For one instant, OG was astonished that Estie had stabbed Reza. But when she thought about it at the sink, she realized that she had looked into those alert and awakened eyes, and had seen her own strength mirrored in Estie's eyes. It was OG's action that had given Estie the power to act for herself and when the fork hit, she wasn't surprised, she was elated! That rope she'd been using to rein herself in -- when she came to the end of it, she said good riddance and let go -- and the end result was that she acted for someone else and could hardly believe how good it felt.

During this reverie, OG dimly heard the door to the kitchen open and close behind her. Whoever came to the room in didn't say anything. Then, as the noise next door ratcheted down and her own breathing slowed, she thought she heard the clink of a fork against metal. The sound of regular chewing.

Dani was hunkered over the kitchen counter where Margaret had set out two lemon meringue pies to cool. The girl was forking huge bites of meringue into her mouth. She didn't seem to be chewing at all. Pie was just disappearing down her open throat. To OG's astonishment, one pie, which had been whole when she walked in, was perhaps half gone and blobby egg whites and fractured crust.

"What the hell?" she said. "Margaret made that pie for everybody!"

" 's my pie." Dani shoveled in another big bite so that the words came out along with crumbs of crust and meringue which clung to her long red tongue like solid bubbles. Somewhere in the half-chewed mess, OG thought she recognized the word "graduation" then "celebration."

"She made it to celebrate you leaving -- not graduating. You can't graduate if you get taken out because you're not progressing."

Dani brought her head down closer to the pie tine and started spooning in lemon curd. "I'm leaving." She motioned with the fork to the kitchen door where the sound of Reza's low whimpers and Darlene's curt voice saying "This fork is not coming out," ooze through. "That's better than you're doing. You're stuck forever in this zoo."

In that split second of time which seemed to elongate and stretch into thinner and thinner layers, OG saw that the rope had one more kink in it.

Dani's head was bent low, her neck curved and vulnerable. She was half-turned away from OG hunkered over the pan so she could keep shoveling pie into her maw.

Without thinking, OG pushed hand against the back of Dani's head and pushed down as hard as she could. Once again, height and leverage came to her aid. Dani, bent close already, went face first into the lemon meringue. A strangled gummy cry came up through egg whites and lemon smush and pie dough while Dani's pretty face -- that sneering, snarky, resting bitch face of a highly successful stripper---sank up to her delicately arced eyebrows.

"Eat your fill," OG said, giving the back of her head one last grinding shove. "Reza was for Estie. This one's for me."

It was amazing how good it felt to march back into the dining room to rat out for eating the entire pie.

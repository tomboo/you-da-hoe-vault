111516 Rewiring from OG perspective

Her closest encounter with killing herself came in moments when life spun out of control.

Often, it felt like her brain was being rewired as she was using it. She\'d be thinking benign thoughts like \'it\'s time to buy a new head for my electric toothbrush and then something would fritz out and she would want to plug the electric appliance and stick a fork in it to see what it be like to fry.

Cataclysm

Occasionally, her emotions would gob-smack her with pain. All she could think, the only drumbeat in her head, was \"make it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\" If the pain wouldn\'t stop on command, she stopped it herself by 1) opening the car door and letting her body drop or 2) opening the drug cabinet and reaching for any pill bottle that promised oblivion (Ex-Lax was an early mistake when she woke up to the taste of charcoal in her mouth and the ignominy of shitting her brains out) or 3) by opening her wrist with a beer can opener and passing out from the sight of so much blood.

Some days, like today, the drumbeat to die, die, die, subsided to an I, I, I of and she was able to do her homework and finish her chores at Healing House and go to therapy with Dr. Hazey without fantasizing about disemboweling herself. She just never knew when the need to jump would hoodwink her out of the daylight into perpetual night.

Hormonal storms.

Adolescent angst.

Garden-variety grief and despair.

The guilt of watching Mom\'s and Dad\'s life insurance get eaten up by treatment fees, followed by Uncle David\'s and Aunt Peggy\'s savings and the ban on family vacations and the awareness that no college money was being set aside for their own kids ate at her. What was wrong with her that she couldn\'t fix herself? Who was she to suck up money that was supposed to pay for trips to Disney World and fund her cousins\' chance at a better life?

If she wasn't alive, she wouldn\'t be responsible for \$120,000 of fees the first year. She\'d already bought Dr. Hazey two new Mercedes or was it Range Rovers? Which one was more expensive for the good doctor\'s well-rounded butt?

She was ashamed that her paltry life dragged on and on when her mother\'s and father\'s and baby Gabe\'s lives had been deleted as easily as a backspace on a key board.

Two Mouth Lake

There was nothing to be done but Old Girl wouldn\'t recognize the futility of trying to rescue a thousand-pound animal maddened by terror and a will to survive.

At first, she was convinced that they could lever the moose with a long and heavy enough branch under its body. She managed to get James and Rachel to join her in stomping on a stand of alder scrub in an effort to break off a sturdy enough tree to hold its weight. But without an axe or a saw, the green trees defeated them. They had a surprisingly robust will to survive to their own. Was that the way to make it through this life? Put down strong enough roots to survive any storm?

Old Girl hauled a big ass branch toward the hole in the ice but before she got halfway out on the ice, there was an ominous crack underfoot. She hesitated and the crack zipped in a zig-zag in front of her and the ice she was standing on started to sink with a few inches of water flowing over it from the shoreline. In seconds, her boot toes were submerged and she felt a springy sensation underneath her soles as if the ice was a moving deck.

James, who was a tree length behind her, immediately dropped to his belly. \"Get down!\" he yelled. \"Spread out your weight before you fall in.\"

His tone was so loud, so strident, Old Girl obeyed him. She saw the spongy ice seem to shiver and right itself when her horizontal weight spread out enough to allow the ice to reach stasis.

The tree she\'d thrown out in front of her was tipping toward the dark water which was flowing on top of the ice toward the hole where the moose was swimming.

\"Shimmy backwards,\" James ordered.

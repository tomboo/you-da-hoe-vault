Scene List

I\'m wondering if I should figure out a scene list so I can write a scene a day during NaNo.

it would be nice to write a plan and check off progress on a plot incline.

Maybe I should create plot inclines for three parts of the story. I could tape three 11 x 17s together so I can see the story as a whole and circle the scenes I\'ve written or check them off visually. It would be nice to carry an 11 x 17 folder in half that I can unroll and consult during my day as I\'m thinking about the story.

What everybody wants

James

James wants to turn back the hands of time to before the moment he offered the stoned girl a ride in his stupid car and they ended up upside down on some hillside in Topanga Canyon. He wants to forget the sight he awoke to. The smell of gas. The silence when there should have been the sound of breathing. He wants to forget the taste of vomit in his throat after throwing up to the crumpled car. The taste of vomit keeps coming to the back of his throat as if all his inner ugliness is threatening to come out of him and reveal him for the vile thing he is. He wants to avoid his parents. He doesn\'t want totalk on the phone \-- thank God Idaho is too backward to Skype which would give him a view of the sorrow and disappointment in their eyes. He wants booze, grass, pills, uppers, downers, anything to make him forget what a sick fucking jerk he is. He wants forgiveness but he doesn\'t realize that he has to forgive himself and make amends.

Lydia the Sex Addict wants closeness and love. She thinks she\'ll get it by having sex with everything that walks, male, female, elderly (ew!) and once a 14-year-old she was babysitting. She offers the Mormon boy a blow job, just to be friendly, and she\'s amazed when he refuses and looks at her with pity instead of desire. He says,\" I\'d like to buy you a pop but I can\'t afford it,\" and she pushers her apple toward him and he looks at her like she\'s given him a diamond. He handles it in front of her and she sees how hungry he is and she walks to the counter and buys a roast beef sandwich and when they part, she sticks it in his back pack when he gets a drink of water at the fountain.

Lydia wants love and closeness and she\'s accommodated to a life with nannies and babysitters and intermittent contact with her serial marrying mother by inappropriate sex. If she offers sex first, she can control the relationship. She prefers boys but girls work too. \"Whatever keeps you warm in the night,\" she likes to say.

She wants to be loved for herself not her body. Naturally she always offers her body and keeps her heart tucked away.

Old Girl (Hope) wants to kill herself.

The Garbage man wants Rachel. He collects things and twists them into things that are half human and half monster like him. He\'s readied a room in his hoarder\'s nightmare for her and he imagine how she\'ll always be on the shelf where he can take her out and look at her.

he wants to kill James for putting his arm around Rachel. He settle for scaring the shit out of him by leaving the maggoty crow on his pillow while James is sleeping.

Dr. Hazy

Garbage man

Dr. Hazy wants every fucked up kid in the program to shut up and stop talking. He can\'t stand to listen to their whining for excuses and lack of responsibility for their fucked up behavior. All he wants to do is take their fees and retire in Hawaii with an endless supply of their drugs to keep him floating in the sky and healing sun and sand.

Hazy started out wanting to help crazy people. His habit of taking the kids\' drugs whenever it gets stressful \-- it\'s always a madhouse! \-- just makes him want more drugs and an escape route to sun and fun that doesn\'t include his nagging wire or her fucked up management of a psychiatric treatment facility. He\'s from the school of the avuncular nod, the sympathetic look, the \"How does that make you feel?\" question he learned from the nightly news and he\'s trained himself to tune out whatever they\'re saying while he floats on a sunlit tropical sea and sees in his mind\'s eye the dark shapes of skates and rays flying in the depths below him. He wants the other therapists to do the real work of counseling and talk therapy for him while he sits at the top of the food chain and plans for a well financed retirement that somehow includes a bottomless well of nitrous oxide. He most wants his staff to leave him alone. \"You figure it out,\" he\'s always saying, as if he\'s empowering them to solve the problem when really he doesn\'t want to do the dirty work.

Is there a character who is a good therapist? In reality, Rosa, who was one of the youngest and least educated of the therapists at Innersept was a mainstay. She was \_\_\_\_ a young child born out of wedlock, had put herself through school in Idaho and worked like a dog. She made a difference in Mad\'s life. By being steady, by listening, sympathizing but showing her an alternate route through chaos.

Names for program should beat Innersept.

Transformations

Idaho Transformations

Inner Cranium

I like whatever was wrong with them can\'t be fixed in the same way as an ingrown toenail or a particularly bilious boil.

Inner Journeys

Idaho Interiors

It used to be called Idaho Interiors until he got sick of getting calls from people who wanted help with their interior decorating crap. Once he answered the phone and someone asked if their services included furniture moving and re-hanging drapes. It sounded easier and more satisfying trying to \_\_\_\_ memories of ancestors than rage out of the psyche.

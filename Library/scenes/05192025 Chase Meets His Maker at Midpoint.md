You Da Ho (working title)

A BIG WOMAN WEARING A SWEATSHIRT THAT READ ["]{dir="rtl"}MOMINATRIX" met Chase Mortimer flanked by two escorts at the door. He'd been expecting Inner Horizons to be a psychiatric hospital with white walls and burly guards so it was confusing when the door of an ordinary ranch house flew open and hisn by a well-upholstered woman who pumped his hands like a lumberjack. "Margaret!" she cried

["]{dir="rtl"}And you?" ---here, she smiled at him doubtfully --- "are you the the new kid at Healing House?"

Chase had no idea why a woman he'd never seen would call him Margaret. And that oddly rueful smile? It was like the Mominatrix was deliriously happy to hear that he'd had won the Lottery, since the winnings were hers.

Thank God, Chase had stashed one last snort of cocaine under the insole of his Nikes when the escorts were busy looking for contraband drugs in his suitcase back at the dorm. While Margaret busied herself signing the escort[']{dir="rtl"}s hold-harmless forms and released them of responsibility for his well-being and safety, the two older men nodded as one and told him God was looking out for him. tThat seemed as good as any time for Chase to hastily excuse himself for the restroom.

A very long nineteen hours before, two unsmiling men in matching NRA jackets, had dragooned Chase away from his freshman dorm in Middlebury, Vermont, at the end of a five-day drug- and booze-fest that had been preceded by months of an upsy-down-daisy-chain of wake-up amphetamines and go-to-sleep downers i.e. his first year away from home at Bard College as he was enjoying it.

Matthias, the wiry, Mormon deacon with the long face, had strip-searched Chase down to his boxers and socks while Aldus, the fat one who popped Mentos like a chain smoker, packed his duffle bag ruthlessly and efficiently. Neither escorts had the courage to stick their noses into Chases[']{dir="rtl"} running shoes; hence the heartfelt Hallelujah Chorus Chase hummed to himself as he shook out a line of white powder on the bathroom counter.

Chase bent to the line the way a starving person bends to an all-u-can-eat buffet. He Hoovered up a sustaining snort and then paused, regretting that this was the last of his stash, not wanting to think too hard about how the hell he was going to replace it in the middle of fucked-up Idaho where his fucking parents had locked him up at a fucking psychiatric treatment program designed to keep him from fucking around.

All the drugs he'd ingested had been draining out of his blood stream for hourss. He needed that white line now to stay as-is, I.E., able to maintain.

A movement beyond the small square window in the bathroom held up Chase[']{dir="rtl"}s next snort.

A furry, feral creature with a black mask pinned him through the glass with a look of disapproval. Chase[']{dir="rtl"}s heart rate was already rocketing---this was good New Jersey shit he[']{dir="rtl"}d just snorted from his funky insole. He\'d stolen it from his dealer before the stingy little shit had a chance to cut it. What? Chase wanted to ask the masked creature who looked kind of like a cat but not. What do you know that I don[']{dir="rtl"}t?

The creature sported a gray neck ruff. Black bands circled its body. A bushy black-and-white tail floated up over its raised back like a warning flag. Facing him at eye level, half a grapefruit perched on the creature's head like a yellow beanie.

TChase had only snorted a tiny squiff. hree quarters of the line remained.

One part of his brain registered serious judgment in black beady eyes. The rest of his brain took in a tilted black ear, pointed muzzle, and gray elf-size fingers that raised the grapefruit rind off its head and held it up to Chase like a chalice.

The thing looked so much like his mother, Chase's heart stuttered in toquick-time. For an instant, he wondered if perhaps it was a good thing he was in Idaho at a treatment center if he was going to be visited by his grapefruit-loving mother who seemed to have changed herself from a New Jersey socialite into a striped tailed rodent.

A high pitched yowl that reminded Chase of a fight he[']{dir="rtl"}d witnessed in Times Square between two [']{dir="rtl"}hos over a john invaded the bathroom. Another fat snarling creature loomed behind the one with the grapefruit and Chase[']{dir="rtl"}s mother was replaced by black-and-white stripes and bandit masks and raking claws that roiled and moiled in a hellish boil of fur and teeth.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Loud raps shook the bathroom door. \"You OK in there? Need any help?" A loud fenale voice filled Chase with existential dread.

He sneezed through abused sinuses, dimly registering the spray of red mist that dotted the oak counter like a rash. It felt like he[']{dir="rtl"}d been snorting sand in his lungs for a century.

["]{dir="rtl"}Uhhhh..." He stopped. Put one hand over his rabbiting heart. ["]{dir="rtl"}Do you hear cats fighting outside?"

Whoever was outside sucked in a deep, indignant breath. Son of a bitch!" A woman screamed ---the name "Margaret" wafted through cocaine-cracking neurons as if from a galaxy far, far away --- ["]{dir="rtl"}Those fucking. raccoons!!!!"

How Chase got himself out of the bathroom and stumbled down a distant hall of closed doors and finally wandered into a large living room, with too many couches was a mystery. He kept expecting the Mominatrix to come at him with her gray curls flying and grill him about how long he[']{dir="rtl"}d been in the john. Strangely, the living area with four couches was empty and silent.

Chase had the feeling he was watching TV though he was only lying back on a couch and watching through a big picture window as half a dozen raccoons milled around overturned garbage cans in ta driveway. He tried unsuccessfully to shake off the feeling that his heart was going to carry off his body. He was aware that raccoons were a normal phenomenon in Idaho where he'd landed two hours before. He'd seen raccoons in alleys on Manhattan[']{dir="rtl"}s upper Eastside where Mom and Dad lived in a brow stone on the same floor as a hedge fund investment banker and a guy with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.

One baby raccoon teetered on the rim of a garbage bin, then dropped abruptly out of sight into a dark maw.

The sight of big-assed Margaret stomping past the window with a big-ass shotgun raised to her big-ass shoulder increased Chase's sky-rocketing heart rate. *Get me out of here*, he was thinking, at the moment she pressed a rifle stock to one eye and squeezed the trigger immediately transforming a raccoon licking from a yogurt container into red neon-colored mist..

Chase sank back against the couch, chest banging in the back of his throat. His head felt like it was being jackhammered. A sudden bright burst of light split his brain wide open like a cantaloupe.

By the time Margaret got back to the living room, the new kid---Jason? Chasen?\-- was passed out on a couch. She couldn[']{dir="rtl"}t figure out what the hell was wrong with him so she leaned over and shook him.

She[']{dir="rtl"}d been standing around for a long time outside the bathroom waiting for him to finish peeing so she could explain the house rules to him. Then she[']{dir="rtl"}d had to run outside to chase off those fucking raccoon who[']{dir="rtl"}d gotten into the garbage again before Hazey arrived with the Certification Review Team. She[']{dir="rtl"}d have done anything to avoid throwing Hazey into a shit fit; he[']{dir="rtl"}d already declared jihad on anybody who screwed up the formal review by the Insurance Certification Board.. The boy had seemed fine when he ran off to the bathroom, hung over maybe, a little strung out, just like every other kid who came into the Program ["]{dir="rtl"}to get help."

Was he asleep? Passed out from jet lag?

She watched his chest for a minute, expecting to see it rise and fall. Instead, a pulse jumped erratically in his neck like a live wire.

She flipped his body up to sitting, then forced his head down between his knees, pushing it down below the level of his chest to help his blood pressure level out . She speed-dialed 9-1-1 in a rising panic. His pulse rate was so high, she could barely count it.

Shit in a shoe!

Dr. Hazey didn[']{dir="rtl"}t pay her nearly enough. A kid only a few years younger than her own kids was dying in her arms of heart attack.

063015 Rusty Harnesses the Power of Inertia

Rusty prided himself on being a hell of a driver. You grew up around a dump and learned to drive a forklift and a \_\_-ton grader at eleven and you were a pro before you even got your stupid driver's license.

The trick he'd been working on lately was unloaded the stake-bed truck without touching a single trash can. It involved getting up speed and using the brakes so that the load in the back of the truck would unload itself with the help of gravity. Dr. Hazey had seen him deposit a load of empty cans at his house without even getting out of the truck and Hazey said it was a hell of a trick. He had some complicated explanation about harnessing the forces of inertia which meant zero to rusty except that hed basked in Dr. Hazey's admiration for the rest of the day. Most days he went around picking up trash or shoving stinkin garbage around on the grader and no one spoke to him. Hell, Hazey had clapped when the cans slide off the ¼" plywood sheet to the asphalt and only one of the cans tipped over.

Too bad the witch Margaret who gave him the stink eye was always watching at the house with the girl in the tee shirt.

The trick was how much you applied the brakes at the right moment.

You had to get up speed and tap the brakes at the right moment, usually a few times. It worked better with a load of lumber or anything long, like once he got in a load of spindly aspen trees that the Simplot corporation cleared out of the bottom land by the \_\_\_\_\_ River.

Anything that was long slid out of the stakebed whole instead of dropping individually like a load of bowling pins. He solved the problem of each trash can dropping on its own by putting a slap of ¼" plywood under them. It was light enough to slide on its own and the cans came with it. That was the metho he was using when Hazey gave him a standing ovation.

He didn't care much for Hazey. He was always late paying his bills and he insisted on paying by check instead of cash, the way he liked. But Rusty gave him credit for always saying hello and asking, "How's it going?" It was more than he got from most of his customers. He was used to being given a wide berth. For a guy who didn't have dirt under his fingernails and took too many baths, Hazey was OK. He just smelled kind of funny. Like Annie Greensprings or something.

He tried not to hold it against him for being a nutty professor who made a living treating a bunch of nut cases.

One time Hazey asked him how he got into the dump business and he told him that his old man dumped it on him, like a load of shit. That made Hazey laugh. But then he ruined it when he said, "If you ever want to talk about it.." and Rusty practically ran to the truck and floored it. Jesus. What kind of nutso would ask him about his personal business? Only another nut. Better not get too close.

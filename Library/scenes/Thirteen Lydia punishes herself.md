Lydia kept a rigid balance sheet and by nine pm, it was time to see what it added up to in her moral accounting. She went over today's score while flossing and brushing her teeth at the sink in the room she shared with Essie .

1.  1\) Stealing \$20 from Darlene's purse.

2.  2\) Slapping the shit out of James for refusing to have sex.

3.  3\) Crying like a baby during her mother's visit, then telling Dr. Hazey to fuck off for defending her.

4.  4\) Joining in on the Essie torment with psychopath Danny and sycophant Reza, both of whom made her want to puke, then taunting Essie until she lost it and got sent to Stable for stabbing Reza in the hand with a fork.

5.  5\) Palming Essie\'s dinner brownie and cramming it down her throat, then puking it up in Margaret's office, and leaving it to ferment in the trash can so Margaret would be gassed out of her office in the morning.

If she had been just middling bad, like usual, say she had laughed at James's flat feet or poked fun at Big Paul for failing to lose weight or talked trash about the new girl's freaky fit in her hearing\--she would have made herself sleep without a pillow. If her behavior was worse, like she'd ratted on someone for sneaking cigarettes (Maida) or shamed them enough to make them cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose, wiped up grape juice with a favorite cashmere sweater (Danny), she would have stripped the bed and made herself lie all night on a bare stained mattress without a blanket.

It wasn't until she heard Charlene report at dinner that Idaho storm winds were gusting and the wind chill factor was five degrees below zero that her inner judge declared a trifecta. Bare floor. Open window. Nude.

Stripped down to camisole and bikini pants, she ran through her usual skin care routine, removing her make up and lathering French eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, exfoliating the dead cells from her face with a salt scrub, closing her pores with an astringent that smelled like sulfur and vinegar from the Dead Sea, thinking about how when the cat played with the mouse too long, it was time for atonement.

At nine PM, she cracked the window open as far as it would go and by nine-thirty, frost had already started to crystalize the inside of the pane with ice diamonds. Her bare feet felt the wind stealing across the floor and a prickle of skin on the back of her neck rose in anticipation of full body goose bumps.

She dropped her underpants and knelt at the side of the bed like a cloister penitent. Then she lay on her right side where she could see the drift of slowly swirling snow flakes chase the heat away from the room. You made your bed, now lie in it, she told herself.

It was dim and silent. A silver glow from the waning moon reflected off the snow covered fields that led to the Kootenai River and the pulp mill next to the train tracks that skirted Coeur D'Alene.

Healing House settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans. She forced herself to keep her eyes open so she could watch the slow progress of the moon creep up the far wall and crawl across the ceiling with a swath of glacial blue light. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.

A whisper of frigid breeze brought up chill bumps up on her legs and arms. Quiet, she ordered herself to stop trembling.

You did this.

You're disgusting.

You're not even here.

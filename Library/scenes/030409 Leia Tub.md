030409 Leia Tub

Peer Interaction

It was like an itch. A terrible itch. And the more you scratched, the worse it itched. Leia had been hoping the newbie would be a boy --a hella-boy with a hella-itch itch to match. She had been seriously bummed when the long haired blond girl stumbled into breakfast this morning asking for coffee. The expression on her face when they said she could have herbal tea!

James was busy stuttering through his list of behaviors in Process Group: Darlene's dopy idea of a welcome ritual for the new girl. James seemed to be confessing his sins to heaven. A flush crept out of his shirt collar and began climbing up his cheeks like a thermometer. Jesus Christ, he can't be embarrassed about getting shit-faced, can he? Isn't that the purpose of high school? James was definitely showing signs of wimping out with her. Leia couldn't understand why everybody said that teenage boys were indiscriminately horny. In Leia's experience, which was broad, boys were hella- horny *at first*. But when they met up with the itch, its implacability (a word on her G.E. D. vocabulary list) they dropped off like flies.

It was the new girl's turn to show her underwear. She crumpled over backwards and began flopping like a carp. *Maybe they should have given her the coffee,* flashed through Leia's mind..

Leia got the wooden spoon that Darlene screamed at her to get --*what, are they going to beat her with it?* -and then, because she didn't know what else to do, sat down in Darlene's chair while the seizure went on and on. The girl looked positively Friday the Thirteenth, so freakish Leia couldn't watch, which was lucky because her eyes fell on Darlene's bag crammed into the chair seat next to her. The wallet was clearly visible at the top. Everybody else was tuned into the freak show. She picked out a twenty dollar bill in one smooth motion and it was safe in her pocket before the jerking and shuddering came to a stuttering halt.

When Darlene and Bruce were busy bundling the blond up to go to the hospital, Leia nudged James from behind, then slipped into the bathroom.

She immediately rejected her original idea of meeting James in the tub pant-less. Some brainiac had installed the old porcelain claw-foot tub on an exterior wall of Healing House. Maybe it was okay in summer but in the middle of January, she half-expected ice cubes to spill out of the tap. Nobody in their right mind ever took a bath in here; Healing House didn't have enough hot water for twelve people, much less heating up a frozen this tm size of an iceberg. Leia could hear her nutcase aunt back in Montreal telling her, "Get in and get out!" when Leia had to take a bath in the winter. Maybe that was why David, her cousin who was three years older, started to crawl into her bed when she was eleven. *The son-of-a-bitch was cold*. It was perhaps the only kind thing she'd ever thought about him. Was this Inner Horizon shit finally working?

She dismissed that idea like a smell in the bath room. What in hell was taking James so long? She had heard the Suburban rumble past the window on the way to the hospital, she thought.

Then the shower rings jingled and Pavlov's dog couldn't have climbed up James lanky body and thrown its legs around his waist faster than she did. James grunted -- she couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was half way down his throat. He was kissing her back when the door flew open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes were locked on Leia's. She could feel a silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to sit her lip to keep a giggle from bursting past her teeth.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being heard-- that, and the fact that the Pee Clogger didn't bother to wash at the sink.

When the door barked shut, her nort flew out like a caged bird. She had bitten down on her lip so hard, she had drawn blood which James wiped off gallantly with the tail end of his flannel shirt. "Shit," he breathed, "that was close." "Not as close as this, big boy." Leia pawed at his belt buckle but James put his hand over hers and held her off. '"Don't," he said. "There's no way I can concentrate. Not after all the shit that's gone down today. "

The itch was strumming in her Leia's inner thighs by then. "Concentrate? What's there to think about?" She had a momentary flash of empathy with the crazy girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Leia shared most of the time. The feeling that her body , never Leia, was the one in charge. If the body didn't get what it wanted, it would seize what it needed, the hell with the consequences. Leia saw the new girl's heels drumming the floor. \"Pleeeeeease!" It came out like a whine, but she couldn't help it. If she didn't set off, she was going to break in a million little pieces.

James was already jingling the curtain rings, on is way out of the this.. \""Just chill," he said, trying to make light of things. The bathroom temperature dropped another twenty degrees as the door shut behind him.

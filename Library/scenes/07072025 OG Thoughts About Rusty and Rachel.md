07072025 OG Thoughts About Rusty and Rachel

An outstanding issue: what is the purpose of Rusty telling OG he bought Rachel a blanket when he hasn\'t met her? Is there some deeper implication about our prior sins and how they do or don\'t figure in to our final reckoning?

OG has, in the dim recesses of her mind, seen this guy before. Maybe around Healing House? Or was he picking up stuff to be recycled at Hazey\'s office. She remembers a short, greasy man who filled up the hallway with the smell of garbage who was loaded down with old computer equipment, an ancient monitor, a snake\'s nest of wires and broken connections and disabled modems. He could have been taking them away to be refurbished or junked. Maybe Hazey called him to see if there was any money or utility in the throwaways.

Which got her thinking in the moment of his passing what utility he had to her or was the question really about what utility she added to his throw-away life?

OG\'s role is to witness his exit through that narrow space to the wider one beyond. She is pressed or pretzeled into the pushed in cab to pass on comfort with her warmth and presence to be soon-to-be-cooling carcass. It\'s not on her to pas judgement. Whatever he had done or has not done in his short throw-away life isn\'t her concern; it only occurs to her in the cold of the busted out cab because life is bleeding out of him while life still courses through her.

For once, she isn\'t seriously thinking about joining him. Something about his blue-ing carcass is like a piece of meat that is being thrown in the deep freezer of a February night to be preserved for the hungry forest creatures who will need sustenance now or in the spring. Something about that idea of the transformation, of matter being neither created nor destroyed, just transformed to another state jolts her out of her old rut.

Dying isn\'t the end for this dump guy, a dirty throw away person who lived by taking other people\'s garbage and turning them into something someone else could use, like coin or barter or fertilizer of packing material or simply another layer of decomposing litter at the bottom of the landfill he called home.

What is salvaged? What remains? He\'ll soon be a carcass, a blue-tinged slab of meat, that is hidden fairly deep in the grove of Ponderosas near a killer intersection that people familiar with it slow down for before they ultimately speed away.

Will he be found soon? She doubts it. The wind soughing in the boughs occasionally sends a drift of snow from overloaded branches like a rime of hoarfrost down on the truck. It\'s already half-buried. Its dark green color makes it blend in the darkness of the forest understory. Maybe his frozen body will thaw out in the spring. Maybe it will feed the coyote kits who\'ll be growing fast and need all the calories they can get in a few months. They\'ll find the flesh and the viscera and whatever else is salvageable and they'll leave the bones to dry out and bleach and decompose into the forest floor. All manner of mycorhyzal fungi and mushrooms and beetles who live in the dung will eat and eat till whatever was man will be moss

Why she doesn't seek help

It's clear even to someone who forgot everything they taught her in Emergency 101 that no help is ever coming. The garbage man is pinned in the truck. The big bore of his heart muscle is plugged by the steering column but the longer blood oozes down the steering column and leaks a dark trail to the floor boards, death will follow its darkness. He'll either exsanguinate or he'll go to sleep and freeze to death, with or without her.

He wants her to stay.

So she stays. She knows staying won't save him but because staying will comfort him, it feels like an even trade. She couldn't do it for Mom and Dad; why not salvage something her absence then and her presence now?

It's a pretty simple calculation. She can hike back onto the road and keep walking till the night lifts, possibly flag down the milk truck around 4 am which she knows is the only sure traffic on this lonely road. If she manages to find a ride, help will be hours away and the mortally injured man will already be gone wherever he is going and he'll go alone. Or she can stay with him and tell no one because telling won't help him. If she stays, she'll just keep him connected to another human being who is breathing in the same space until his breath cuts off and the two of them then go off to their destinies having held onto each other in the dark.

A different way

OG stays but why is murky. Sure, he asked her to, so: human decency. It's clear he needs help but when she gets a closeup look at how far a steel column has penetrated his chest cavity, it's also clear no help is possible. It was his bad luck that the column stopped within an inch of constricting his heart to a stop. But now the ooze of some inner muscular tear I unluckily plink-plink-plinking his life to the floor.

It was his bad luck that the crash pressed the column into his chest within an inch of constricting his heart to a stop. Now the steel plugs the hole it made except for a small gap of the turn signal that allows his life to plink-plink-plink to the floor.

The garbage man can't go anywhere and OG isn't going either. Help is too far away. She stays because the only thing she has to offer is herself.

There isn't a lot of talking. When he does speak, his voice is a rattly kind of whisper that sounds like a chain is wrapped around his throat and only letting in a little air.

At one point he tells her he's cold. "You're warm.\" He's looking down at their linked hands where she's trying to will some blood into his cold fingers. "She woulda been real warm cuz I bought her a new blanket."

OG wonders if he's seeing someone who isn't there.

"Give her the blanket." He lifts one hand hand from hers and points somewhere behind him." It's in the cubby."

OG looks where he's pointing. If there was once a space back there, it's now a burial space flattened by a bench seat pressed flush against a steel cab. OG crouches sideways. The driver faces front, like he's still driving while boxed in by an engine block transformed into tangle of jagged shards.

"That was nice of you," OG says taking up his hand once again. She has some inchoate desire to keep him talking. Maybe if he's talking to her, he won't see death approaching with its noose.

"Huh?"

"The blanket," she repeats. The one you bought for...." She has no idea how to go on.

"She's prettier than you are," he says.

"A lot of people are," she answers.

"Never seen chocolate skin."

A prickle of unease. "Oh?"

'"She's another one-a you Hazey nuts."

OG's sense of unease wars with a feeling of dread. \"Do I know her?"

"Name's Rachel. So pretty I could eat her up."

Wariness gives way to consternation. "How do you know Rachel?"

"Never met her."

The garbageman's eyes close as if against the pain. His breath is coming harder. If he doesn't say anything else, she's going to drop it because uncertainty is better than knowing a lot of things if you want to protect yourself.

His dark eyes fix on her, his pupils dark in the wells of shadowed orbital sockets. "I saw her pee in the snow," he confides.

She has water. He won't drink. She has an extra hoodie she tucks around his neck. And Gabe's floppy eared hat which is ridiculously small for his big head and won't stay down over his ears. She gives up and flings it back in her pack, its strings stiff with blood.

He drops this bomb about knowing her --- one-a you Hazey nuts--- like its both a curse and badge of honor. She should know that, he implies.

"She's like you. One-a Hazey's nuts."

It's like he drops a bomb in the quiet cab.

"You know Rachel?" She can't keep the quiver out of her voice.

"Saw her pee in the snow."

If she was wary before, now she is truly unsettled.

"You came out to let her back in," he continues, confirming a dim memory of having seen him before and suddenly recognizing the truck as the same garbage truck that picks up trash at Healing House.

"When'll she coming?" he asks. "I'm cold."

"Soon," OG says with the sure knowledge that it will be the sooner than later that's coming for all of us. She takes up fingers that twitch now and then until they still and stiffen in as the night turns from black to blue.

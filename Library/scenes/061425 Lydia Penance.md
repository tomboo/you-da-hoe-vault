061425 Lydia Penance

Part of Lydia Arc Compilation for Kerry Savage

\<\$W\>

Lydia kept a rigid balance sheet of her behavior. By nine pm, it was time to see what it added up to in her moral accounting. She went over today[']{dir="rtl"}s score while flossing and brushing her teeth at the sink in the room she shared with Estie when Estie wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t at Stable.

1\) Stealing \$20 from Darlene[']{dir="rtl"}s purse.

2\) Slapping the shit out of James for refusing to have sex.

3\) Crying like a baby during her mother[']{dir="rtl"}s visit, then telling Dr. Hazey to fuck off for defending her.

4\) Joining in on the Estie torrment with psychopath Dani and sycophant Reza, both of whom made her want to puke, then taunting Estie until she lost it and got sent to Stable for stabbing Reza in the hand with a fork.

5\) Palming Estie\'s dinner brownie and cramming it down her throat, then puking it up in Margaret[']{dir="rtl"}s office, leaving it to ferment in the trash can so Margaret[']{dir="rtl"}s office would gass the place tomorrow morning.

If she had been just middling bad, like say she had laughed at James[']{dir="rtl"}s flat feet or shamed Big Paul for gaining weight or talked in the new girl[']{dir="rtl"}s presence about her freaky epileptic fit that made her look like a carp \--she would have just made herself sleep without a pillow.

If she[']{dir="rtl"}d behaved worse, like by ratting on someone for sneaking cigarettes (Maida) or making someone cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose, wiped up grape juice with someone[']{dir="rtl"}s favorite cashmere sweater (Dani), she would have stripped the bed and made herself lie all night on a bare stained mattress without a blanket.

It wasn[']{dir="rtl"}t until she heard Charlene report at dinner that Idaho storm winds were gusting and the wind chill factor was five degrees below zero that her inner judge declared a trifecta. Bare floor. Open window. Nude.

Stripped down to camisole and panties, she ran through her usual skin care routine, removing her make up and lathering French eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, exfoliating the dead cells from her face with a salt scrub, closing her pores with an astringent that smelled like sulfur and vinegar from the Dead Sea, thinking about how she was the cat who played with the mouse too long when she took food away from Estie. Time for atonement.

At nine PM, she cracked the window open as far as it would go. By nine-thirty, frost had already crystalized the inside of the glass with ice diamonds. Her bare feet felt the wind scatter a haze of snow flakes across the floor. A prickle of skin on the back of her neck started to raise full body goose bumps.

She dropped her underpants and bra and knelt at the side of the bed like a penitent at her own personal cloister. Then she lay on her back where she could see the drift of slowly swirling snow flakes chase the heat away from the room. You made your bed, now lie in it, she told herself.

It was dim. Silent. A silver glow from the nearly full moon reflected off the snowy fields that led to the Kootenai River. A snake of sulfur crept into the room from the pulp mill next to the train tracks that skirted the town of Coeur D[']{dir="rtl"}Alene .

Healing House settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans as she watched the slow progress of the moon creep up the far wall and crawl across the ceiling with a swath of glacial blue light. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.

A frigid breeze brought more snow in through the window. Quiet, she ordered herself, stop shivering in an attempt to keep warm.

You did this.

You[']{dir="rtl"}re disgusting.

You[']{dir="rtl"}re don[']{dir="rtl"}t belong in this world.

You[']{dir="rtl"}re not even here.

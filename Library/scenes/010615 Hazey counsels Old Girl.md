010615 Hazey counsels Old Girl

Hazey imagined borrowing the walking stick from one of the men on the wall and beating the aberrant thoughts of dying out of her.

"You have your whole life to live! You're smart. You're funny. Sure, you've experienced cataclysmic tragedy and the bad luck to lose both your parents and your baby brother, but you're alive. You have a choice to breathe in a new breath. Take a step toward something! Anything! Connect with one of the kids, boy or girl."

Hazey, contrary to the rules of the program that he had set, was sex-agnostic. Except for the legal ramifications, he personally thought that more sex not less for some of his hormonally raging patients who'd grown up without enough love or security might even help. Try it, Old Girl. Let yourself be young for once, he wanted to cry.

Old Girl blew in to her session dressed in her usual black goth-punk-depressed garb. Hazey himself was hazy on the origins of when she'd begun wearing all-black. When she got to the program as an adolescent, she wore normal kid gear. Oversize teeshirts with inappropriate messages like "Eat Me" or "I'd Rather Be a Dick than a Dave." Now her ginger-colored dreadlocks were caught up at the top of her head with a black shoelace. She looked like she had a shock of carrots sprouting on her head. She could hide behind all that black---even the expression on her face today was black---but she couldn't hide the fact that life was bursting out all over her.

She paced before the picture window in his office that looked out on the frozen lake. When it was covered with ice, Lake Couer D'Alene looked like the world's largest skating rink.

"Bad day?" Hazy said, noncommittally to her back.

"Fucking horrible," she said. "I want to go back to Adolescents."

You and every old person in this world, Hazey thought, remembering the time in his life when he was Old Girl's age and thrumming with hope and hormones.

"You're 18k now. Over the line. "His shrug, patented over long hours with every pathology in the DSM, conveyed he was sorry. If it was up to him...

"Bull shit. You're the director. You founded this shit hole. You could put me back where I belong away from all these idiots."

One of Old Girl's problems was that she was too damn smart. Every time you tried to pull the wool over her eyes, she called you on it.

"You've only been there a month. What's the problem with Young Adults?"

"They're all adolescents."

For a second, he thought she was making a joke but then he realized she was serious. He laughed anyway. "Did you hear yourself? What you just said?"

She sank into the corner of the love seat. Her small body perched directly under the photo of the three farmers on their way to a dance. He hadn't noticed it before but she almost looked one of the young men. Same black pants, same black fitted jack and a fedora-like hat she'd set next to her as if she wanted to be careful of the creases. The only thing she was missing was a homemade walking stick.

"You think it's funny that I'm asking to go back to Adolescents when I'm complaining about living with a bunch of babies?" Her delicate, lightly freckled face reflected a moment, then bloomed with a sudden grin. "That is kind of humorous."

"What's the real problem at Young Adults."

"I hate having a roommate."

They had fewer patients in Adolescents so everybody got a single room, but it was the teenage years when every kid went nuts, so all the YAs had to double up at Healing House.

"You don't like Rachel Interlachen?"

Hazey pulled out a stack of reports and thumbed threw them to find Rachel's status report written by Rosa Musselman, her therapist. "Says here Rachel is a model citizen. Polite. Unassuming. Helpful."

"Are you sure you're not reading the Girl Scout manual?"

Hazey let the silence work on her.

"She wants to be friends."

Ah. The real thing, at last.

"I want my single back."

"We had more room in Adolescents. Everybody has to double up in Young Adults."

"Could you at least put me in with somebody who's not a Pollyanna?"

"What's a Pollyanna?"

"Somebody who always looks on the bright side. It makes me want to slap her."

Hazey was thinking about the walking sticks again. How he'd like to borrow one and beat some will to live back into Old Girl with it.

"Wouldn't it be less lonely if you let her be friends with you?"

Old Girl stared out at the ice that stretched toward an ever-diminishing patch of dark open water, as if she'd walk right out to its blackness if he opened the door. The walking stick could also be used as a crutch or something to cling to, if she would just reach for it and hang on. Maybe he should take the stick and use it as both.

"She needs a friend. Rachel is all alone, first week away from her family and friends. She's in a strange place with strange rules and strange people. What if it's not about what you need and more about what she needs?"

Old Girl tented her hands over one knee. She was still pretending to focus on the lake but Hazey could see by the tension in her body and the alert tilt of her head that she was listening. He pressed on. "just listen to her," he said. "Put yourself in her shoes and ask yourself what she needs."

Old Girl was already scooping up the black fedora and jammed it over her carrot sprouts over her ears. "You're the Pollyanna," she said. "How'd I get so lucky to get two of you?"

She flounced out the door and slammed it like the adolescent she was.

Maybe he was the one who needed the walking stick. He could use it to beat the hope out of himself that he was actually doing something for Old Girl.

OK. She really was still an adolescent, no matter that she'd turned 18 in December.

He contemplated the natty farmers in their best black clothing who were forever stopped by the photographer and waiting politely for the picture to be finished so they could go on to their fun. Hazey wished he was going to something fun. Then he wished for a walking stick he could use to cudgel the hope for Old Girl's depression to lift out of himself. It would hurt, sure, but it would hurt worse if he couldn't reach her before she hit open water.

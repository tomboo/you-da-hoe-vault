Setting for Idaho

Today I\'m writing about who\'s crazy. Hunger makes one crazy if it gets ahead of you. Rusty the Garbage-man is hungry for affection, a scrap, a touch, a hiya or how are ya on the street which is why he gets an unhealthy \_\_\_ for Rachel.

Hazey is hungry for outside recognition. He\'s hungry for peer respect and he\'s in bumfuck Idaho where respect is in slim supply.

All the natural creatures in the middle of winter are hungry. The raccoons want to eat the garbage in the garbage bins and they are clever with tiny hands that can lift the lids of the bins if they climb up on top of the frame that holds them. The coyote is hungry and had to feed her hungry pups when she awakes and leaves them in their den and then inspects the backpack Old Girl has laid down on the roadside next to her as she awaits an uncaring car.

\"Reality is a hot medium. TV is a cold medium\"

Margaret is hungry for regular employment and benefits instead of the part-time shift that wouldn\'t feed a flea.

So about half the characters are hungry. A metaphoric landscape of empty and full starving and prowling for food.

[Setting:]{.underline}

I\'m writing story set in frozen Idaho where winter has its grip on the blue tree mountains and the black water that flows sluggish and slow under lake ice a foot thick. It\'s silent and white: the only sounds in the Idaho landscape. In town are the roar of snow plows likes wounded animals always roaming the streets.

Sound has a way of being swallowed up in snow. Cold and lifeless, it feels vast like it stretches deep into the wilderness and where Old Girls tramps up the trail she feels the cold calling to her inner coldness. Not feeling= not experiencing life which is why the metaphors of Old Girl\'s feet coming painfully to life as blood runs into her feet is the image of life returning.

What about the community college a flat gray moonscape of concrete and square boxes. To Rachel N.I.CC feels like a community college without community. She describes the cold and characterless of the school to being new but even Old Girl who was pleased to earn taking classes there was disappointed to learn it was desert of a place. These are kids who want warmth and friendship but they feel alienated from the other college kids because they can\'t hang out or go to movies unless they get permission and it\'s too hard to explain their dilemma to possible friends. Easier to just stay aloof and disconnected.

So describing the community college starts with its flat aspect, its angles and straight lines and neo modern box-on-box architecture that\'s alien to the western character the kids expect in Coeur d\'Alene. What the hell? Rachel thinks. How did I end up in the mall when I thought I was coming to wild and wooly west Calamity Jane on Xandx there so she can stumble around like Sanity Jane in a puffy North Face coat and a hood clogged with gray road dust that piles up on the snow [\_\_\_]{.underline} like black bilge line until it spawns.

Warmth happens between people and not in the exterior landscape of either Healing House of NICC.

I need to lock the Healing House setting. In fact, its\' a characterless ranch house that\'s been extended on two ells that make up a boy\'s wing and a girl\'s wing of bedrooms. The furniture is Shaker oak--a stern non-furbelowed style with sharp edges and angles that mirrored the structure of the programs rules. The walls look hard fought like a battle is constantly being waged by the rough housing of the kids, particularly the boys. The kids are transient so the main living areas are vanilla--it\'s like in the space is halfway between an institution and a home. If a kid has been around a long time like OG her half of the room is living in as the individual transgresses herself on the bed and walls. Rachel feels the characterless zero-ness of the newbie when she moves in until she puts her photos up. Or does Rachel see that OG has failed to put her imprint on the space? Other bedrooms, like Lydia\'s, are stuffed with personal things. Lydia\'s mom practically sent in an interior designer with zebra skin rug and leopard printed blankets so the place looks like macaws and toucans ought to be flying over anytime soon. OGs rooms by contrasts is beige and blank like she\'s removed the color in life as she gets ready to run. You can tell where people are on the spectrum of settling in to reality of life in a psychiatric treatment program. You start out a blank slate and little by little you put down roots with a filled out chalk board and pictures of [your pals and Edvard iunch's Scream]{.underline} on the wall (that\'s OG one nod to interior decoration).

Rachel sees the white and blue landscape of Idaho the way a Midwesterner, used to flatland and corn fields, sees it. Like a wonderland of diamond dusted peaks and blue glacial waters. Old Girl, closer to death and [severely]{.underline} depressed, hears its silence and the soft suck of water that barely gurgles in its black under-ice flow so slow, you can almost see the molecules seizing into crystalline ice.

James sees the landscape the way a Californian, used to sun and light, sees it--on his skin and in his [hair]{.underline}. He\'s always wearing a coat inside because the place is freezing and unless he\'s playing basketball or running on the treadmill he feels the cold creeping into his cells.

Margaret is used to the cold. She\'s got some flesh on her, a layer of blubber that insolates her from the chill the kids are always complaining about. She has to put a lock on the thermostat or they\'d have it at 90 degrees.

[Raccoon scene:]{.underline}

Hazey gets on a jihad about the raccoons after he drives the certification review team up to Healing House and the raccoons have strewm garbage from hell to breakfast.

011518 OG opened her eyes to a circle

OG opened her eyes to a strange circle of heads all peering down at her. The world was strangely whitewashed and transparent around the edges. She focused on the most solid and stationary thing her field of view: the one black face among all the wide eyes.

"Wha-who?" she croaked.

Worry lines between the brown eyes and dark nimbus of hair. It was Rachel on her knees and patting at OG's face. With a choking tear-clotted voice, she said, "You're OK? OK!" She looked up, shouting, "She's alive!"

OG felt warm air moisten her ear as the fierce strangled words made sense. Then Rachel' face was inches from her own, so close she could smell a faint minty air that was cold and warm at the same time.\
"I thought I lost you too," Rachel's voice. Fierce. Almost angry

Lost? Two? It took a minute in her awakening brain to understand the meaning of the words. Too as in OG, not somebody ele. Rachel's expression was deeply relieved but also mad. She's mad at me? Wonder why?

But then Rachel was alternately crying and hugging her and trying to wipe snow and snot off her face. She could feel warmth and wetness and maybe booger trails all over her cheeks.

The circle of white face around them broke up then and everybone was down on their knees, scrabbling at the snow piuled on her legs, pulled at her arms, brush off the clumping, lumpy wno that was caught in her dreadlocks as they continued their efforts to free her. Someone -- Reza? James -- yanked at an ice clump and pulled one of her dreads hard at the root. Her head lifted up from the snow.

"Ow! Son of a bitch!" OG cried. The first words she could form whole and sensible.

OK-Ok-Okay-Okey-Dokey- went around like a stutter. Shrieks of laughter. Josh and Rachel were pulled her up on her feet. She was wobble, supported on one side by Rachel's tall slimness and Josh's stocky bulk Then James stepped in next to Rachel and OG found herself suspended and supported and slightly dragging between all the three of them all the way back to the van.

Rachel's words -- "Goddamn it! I thought I lost you too!" -- would come back to OG at odd moments after that. Her expression seemed both furious and eeply relieved. I hardly know her, OG thought. Why would she care? But her heart in its creaky and slightly cracked state, would whisper 'she likes you even though she doesn't know you and she cares.'

But her heart---she could almost hear its rustily creaking, as if metal had been clenched for eons--- once it was finally oiled, the whingeing whine and protest was roughly translated into "she cares."

"Why didn't you have an abortion?" OG asked.

"Too late for that," Rachel said. "I was six months pregnant before I figured it out and by then, she already knew."

OG nearly died in a snow cave collapse and now everyone wanted to relive it.

Chase's heart

Chase felt a fleeting awareness that his heart was galloping fast. It felt like it was passing him on a dark, moonless road.

Jesus! She wants to shout. Why couldn't you nimnoes have dithered around like normal instead of getting your shit together enough to dig me out like a crack rescue team. You're a bunch of fuck ups. Crazy people who can't do anything right! Why else would you be locked up with a bunch of other crazies by your loved ones who left you here to rot.

No deed goes unprocessed at Inner Horizons. Which is why Old Girl's death was the main topic of today.

All the kids were talking over each other about their part in saving her. Reza, who had stomped on the ceiling of the cave when James was chasing him, conveniently forgot that it was his body weight that made the roof collapse. "What?" he said, indignant, as only the drunk and clueless can be. "I shoveled so much I got a blood blister on my thumb!"

OG castigated herself over and over. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Why she didn't bury her nose in the snow and cut off her breath, she couldn't say. When the snow caved in, she instinctively clapped her hands over her mouth and buried her face in the well of her arms, creating a small but necessary air pocket that kept her alive.

She couldn't believe she had saved herself with her stupid reptile brain's unbelievable will to survive.

They were all celebrating how heroic, how effective they acted as a team. How goddamn wonderful it felt to save OG's life when OG herself could only think, "Why didn't you let me die?"

James was responsible for leading the rescue effort. He passed out shovels to the strongest diggers, then commandeered the best one for himself. Then dug like hell so fast that he threw up snow like a rooster tail behind him. Rachel was the one who gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. It was slightly icky to remember the feeling of warm air going into her lungs, the strange and unfamiliar pressure of air she wasn't in control of. OG had woken up unable to speak. Unable to form anything but vague thoughts. She gradually came to realize that the warm breath pushing into her lungs was emanating from the black girl's mouth and animating her own.

Lydia handed over a cashmere scarf and the hat that was as warm as a live kitten without a word. For once in her life, she even refrained from saying anything about what it cost.

Josh and James walked her down the trail holding her up on both sides. They stopped and let her stand and breathe for a long time between steps.

OG kept remembering the claustrophobic sensation of the air thinning and dissipating into carbon dioxide as she got light headed and finally passed out. She was so ashamed of herself for trying desperately to suck in the disappearing air. Breathing had never seemed so necessary as when it wasn't possible.

Everyone else tried to outdo each other by recounting their part in the rescue.

"I about peed my pants," Reza said. "I was so scared."

"You should have been, dip-shit. You're the one who walked on OG's head and made the cave collapse," said James.

"So, I got a blood blister digging her out!"

It seemed like a big celebration. Something exciting to exclaim about. A chance to relive their best performances instead of past fuck-ups.

Everyone in the circle of claustrophobic couches was trying to claim they saved her. Og was appalled enough to shout, "I saved myself!"

"Not bad for someone with suicide ideation," Lydia said sweetly. "Dr. Hazey will be so proud."

"Fuck you," OG said. "Take your Prada scarf and go hang yourself."

"It's Givenchy, not Prada," Lydia said. "And you can keep it."

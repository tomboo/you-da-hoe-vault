081215 Only two people knew

Only two people in the galaxy knew why a pack of raccoons would abandon their cryptic coloration for a nuclear rainbow. One of them as lying at the Coeur D'Alene County morgue awaiting autopsy; the other was too wired to sleep.

Margaret had had one hell of a day. What on earth would make a young, presumably healthy twenty-year-old drop dead in the ten minutes she left him by himself when she stalked outside to deal with those fucking raccoons? What if she'd ignored those feral pests and sat and held his hand on the couch and listened to his problems, instead of grabbing the paint gun rifle and squeezing off half a dozen Day Glo paint rounds that scattered the little shits like confetti? Would it have made a difference?

Margaret had been rolling over in her flannel sheets for an hour while Hank whiffled and fizzed and rumbled and sizzled and snorted. She gently nudged him off his back onto his side and a small raspberry of a fart escaped him.

That did it.

Margaret padded out to the kitchen in her bare feet. She put on some milk for cocoa and while she waited it to heat, she flipped on the tiny transistor that sat on the kitchen table. Hank listened to the farm reports on it every morning. She was surprised when instead of the dry-as-dust report on corn and soy yields, Macklemore's voice rang out.

James was hoping Healing House would burn down to its foundation. Reza said they'd have to send everybody home if there was no place to sleep. It was also possible they'd make everybody stand around in the freezing cold watching it burn as a teaching moment though what the lesson was, James hadn't a clue.

Then Reza wanted to share his blanket. Why the dumbass hadn't put on a pair of pants was beyond him. Maybe meth making fried his brains as well as decaying both his teeth and his skin. "Go to hell," James said. "I told you it was freezing."

Reza putted a bulge in the too-small jacket Charleen had given him. "I had to pack up my prescriptions. It'll fuck me up if I miss a dose."

While James had stripped the warm blankets off his bed, Reza had carefully packed his prescription acne treatments. Every man for himself.

James had grabbed his prized letter from UC-San Diego offering him a basketball scholarship. Then, at the last second, he rolled the Rollex his dad used to wear over his wrist. He was already wearing sweats and a hoodie, his usual sleeping attire, under the blankets. What more did he need to get on with life?

Reza pulled at his blankets again. "Don't tell anybody I brought my zit cream."

James snorted. As if. Who would care?

The officious and lank-haired dude who was patrolling the line of yellow tape was glaring at him. James had never seen him in his life. James felt perfectly warm in his blankets but the malevolence in the man's eyes made him shiver. Whoa.

In his hands was a wicked looking pair of wire clippers. For an instant, James had the impression he was about to stick them in the side of his neck. Double whoa.

James backed away from the tapeline. Just because you've got a uniform doesn't make you an authority, he thought, but he wasn't about to say it out loud.

James backed Rachel and Lydia further away from the yellow tape wondering why it was that you put some people in a uniform and it turned into a power trip.

OG perspective

Everybody was pointing now, and murmuring, and every time another raccoon was revealed in a starburst of color, people would oooh and ahhhh like they were watching a light show bloom in the sky.

Old Girl touched a hand to her bare head. A flashlight swept past the owl's silhouette, and in its brief glow, she caught a glimpse of the pink lining of Snoopy's ear. Next to tree that held the owl---one Ponderosa over---a lavender star burst into bloom and then there was a wild and improbably garden of flowers light up I the trees.

Old Girl began to chortle. What else could she do? Gabe's hat was gone and she could choose to focus on the dark, unilluminated spot where it was going to stay from her forever or she could focus on the miracle that was right in front of her. She chose the miracle. And all around her, laughter bloomed around her.

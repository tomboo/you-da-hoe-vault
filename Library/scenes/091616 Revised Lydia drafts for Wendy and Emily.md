Drafts for Wendy and Emily:

These are segments of Lydia reimagined as sicker and more self-destructive.

I need help on how far I can push her and still keep her sympathetic.

1)  **091516 Lydia Waits for Stand-Up Sex with James**

Four

Lydia waited for stand-up sex with James in the bathroom off the living room. Shucked of jeans, naked from the waist down except for cotton socks, it felt like she was standing on a block of ice. The cast iron tub was the size of an iceberg. If James didn't hurry, she'd be carried off by wolves driven by the icy wind prowling under the window sill.

In two hours---exactly one hour and 56 minutes, according to Grandpa Ben's birthday present of a Piaget watch ---Lydia's mother was coming to visit . If James didn't fuck her brains out right now, she wouldn't be able to keep herself from falling apart.

She'd already checked her wallet. The t \$20 bill she'd hijacked from Darlene's purse during the new girl's epileptic fit was safely tucked away. It would cover the cost of the nail polish remover to get rid of her black nails. It would also pay for a French manicure with perfect white crescents, a service \$60 bucks on New York's upper East Side and \$15 in Idaho. The only good thing about Idaho.

If she'd known Rahel would show up in Couer D'alene, she'd never have gone Goth Girl.

Looking around at the faux oak veneer in the faux Shaker bathroom---even the toilet seat was blond oak---Lydia made a note to herself to remember to stash her cheap-ass Betsey Johnson knock-off tote on her roommate, Esty's, side of the room. Her mother had a thing about wearing fakes. "You and I know what's real," she liked to say.

Even in authentic Jimmy Choos, Rahel would be faster than Lydia in running shoes. Her mother kept herself tiny as a ferret and she was always harping after Lydia to lose weight. Gain two pounds and it was social suicide on Rahel Bronfman's scale. What man would want you if you were fat?

The first thing Lydia planned to do after Rahel took off on her Lear jet was to run down to Dunkin' Donuts in downtown Coeur D'Alene and stuff herself with every cake donut and cream cruller on the shelf. She'd imagine her mother looking at the clouds from thirty-thousand feet while her daughter scarfed donut after donut until she couldn't stuff in another bite. Then Lydia would open her mouth and vomit everything she'd swallowed into the maw of the second hand purse her mother left behind for her birthday. That's what I think of your stinking birthday present, Mom.

Lydia wondered what in hell was keeping James. She pushed away the image of the new girl's blond ponytail thumping the hardwood. The sightless eyes rolled up white. The wild tattoo of her heels. Lydia's Godzilla itch for sex, as relentless and bad as it was, was at least on the inside of Lydia's body long with all the other horrible things she kept locked up in her. Only she knew she was freakishly ugly and disgusting inside of her petite and perfectly maintained body. It was a small mercy that she didn't have to wear her ugliness on the outside like the hair shirt of epilepsy the new girl was saddled with.

She had been hoping the new arrival at Inner Horizons would be a boy. Actually, a hella-boy with a hella-itch to match. She had been seriously bummed on Saturday when a tall, bleary-eyed blond named Rachel stumbled into breakfast wanting coffee. The expression on her face when Gretchen told her she could only have herbal tea!

Another of Inner Horizon's rules that had no reason why. It was unanswerable like why no boy wanted anything to do with Lydia outside of sex. She let them do the most amazing things to her and she did equally amazing things to them and then they ran like hell with their shirt buttons askew or their jeans unzipped, the smell of sex trailing after them like skunk. Were guys like James, clueless in all other things, somehow onto her desire to make them weak? Once they got what they wanted, did they intuit that she didn't have anything else to give? What else would you give someone when you already gave them access to your body? No clue.

Yesterday after marathon monkey sex in the girl's restroom at Northern Idaho Community College where she'd started taking classes, James had muttered, "I feel dirty."

She felt like he'd slapped her. "I took a shower this morning!"

"No. It's..." James thought for a long moment as if trying to order his thoughts. "You're like a Hoover. So mechanical."

"You liked it two minutes ago."

"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole. It just feels ... ah... impersonal."

James had been buried balls deep behind her and that was impersonal?

James was holding a spent condom between his thumb and forefinger like a rat corpse when in fact, the squirmy thing was filled with his own sperm. "You make me feel used," he said.

Used and abused was how Lydia felt when he slunk out of the NICC restroom. Now waiting behind the shower curtain in a fake Shaker decor, she felt even worse. No wonder she was having more bulimic episodes.

That was the real reason she was locked up in Idaho. Her orthodontist in Grosse Point ratted her out, telling Grandpa Ben and Gramma Elaine that the back sides of her teeth were pitted as a forty-year-old's. What a shit show. If she couldn't fill herself up with sex, she had to fill herself up with food, but there was no fucking way she'd ever be fat. No one would fuck her if she was fat. It was a vicious cycle. No fucking if she got fat and yet, she was so empty. She hadn't thought of it till that moment, but fucking her brains out for a few minutes lasted about as long as it took to eat a dozen donuts. Then, once you threw up, you were empty and clean as snow.

By the time the door James finally jingled the shower rings like Pavlov's bell, Lydia was already clambering up his lanky body. She threw her legs around his hips and tightened them around his waist until he grunted. She couldn't tell if he was thrown by her weight or was simply speechless because her tongue was already halfway down his throat. He was just starting to kiss her back when the door to the bathroom banged open. *Clomp clomp clomp*. Someone in clogs passed the curtained tub and settled on the toilet. The thunder of a cow pissing on a flat rock. James' eyes widened and locked with Lydia's. She could feel silent laughter shaking his chest and she had to bite her lips to keep from snorting.

Thankfully, Healing House's ancient pipes saved them from being overheard.

When the door shut, a pent up laugh flew out of Lydia like a caged bird.

"Shit," James breathed into her ear, "that was close."

"Not as close as this, big boy." Lydia grappled at his belt buckle but James checked her hands.

"I can't. That new girl... I thought she was dying," James said, holding her away with stiffened arms.

I'm dying, Lydia thought, having a moment of empathy for the epileptic girl who'd just had her body hi-jacked by a seizure. That was the unbearable feeling Lydia felt at being left empty without any flopping or jerking.

"You don't have to think! Just feel!" She was hauling at his belt buckle, convinced he was kidding. She tried to undo the belt and unzip his pants at the same time. "C'mon! Hurry!"

"No!" James straight-armed her in torso. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

"Nothing!" She patted at the area below his belt, looking for evidence of welcome. When she came up flat, she said, "What's wrong with you?"

"Didn't you see that girl? The way her eyes rolled up in her head?"

Lydia's thighs were wiry and toned from years of gymnastics and ballet . She tightened them into a death grip but James, who was way stronger, ended up pushing her down like a donut below his knees.

"Don't hold out on me!" she wailed.

"I'm not. I just ..." James hesitated.

In the pause, she shot up and slapped him as hard as she could.

"What the hell?" James's cheek flushed bright red where her hand had lit his skin like a flare. "Why'd you do that!?"

"I need it!"

Now the flush looked more like a trouble light on James's cheek. "For someone who wants to get laid, you're not exactly turning me on."

"Dick head!"

"Now you're calling me names? What? Is that supposed to make me hot?"

"Fucking dick!" They were both huffing like whales at the surface. Lydia felt a rising volcanic pressure in her chest that was making it hard to breathe.

James was already backing away from her. He stepped out of the tub, jangling the curtain rings like an alarm bell. That's when Lydia's coldness vanished in a flash of heat so intense, she felt like a furnace blast was fueling her.

"You fucking faggot!" she cried. "You can't get it up. You can only get it up for a guy!"

James's head jerked up. The red on his cheek bones where she slapped him burned bright in blue-white skin.

"Limp dick! "Her openhanded slap snapped his head back. "Dickless wonder!" Another slap.

"You weren't calling me names an hour ago!" James was referring to the quickie she gave him before breakfast up against the back wall of the Healing House garage when they were supposed to be cleaning up the trash that the raccoons had strewn around the garbage bins the night before.

That was then, this is now, she thought. Didn't James know that the Godzilla itch started from zero about 30 seconds after sex was over?

"Faggot!"

James had his hand on the white, porcelain door knob and for a deranged instant, Lydia had the impression he was fondling a skull. "Why would I fuck you?" he said." You're fucking crazy."

The bathroom door shut with snick. The sound of clicking and bumping ice. Lydia let her body slide down the cold white tiles until her head rested on the cold white porcelain tub and she watched the ice floe drift away from land.

2)  Hazey and Lydia meet with her mother Rahel

AFTER HIS WIFE, ALMA, LEFT him for a horse whisperer, Dr. August Sanders Hazey often found himself staring at the black and white photo on his office wall. The portrait showed three farmers from the early 20^th^ Century dressed up on their way to a party. He wished he could go with them.

A neat stack of checks awaited his signature. A proposal for cutting costs on Inner Horizon's astronomical insurance premiums needed to be reviewed. A performance review for Darlene, the dour but ambitious head therapist, remained unread. Unsigned.

Dr. Hazey checked the clock again. Another hour before he could reasonably down another muscle relaxant or he wouldn't be able to shake hands, much less keep his head on his neck for his session with Rahel Bronfmann nee---What? The Grosse Point heiress to the Bronfman alcohol fortune had divorced, remarried and then divorced again in the year and a half since Lydia Bronfmann came to the program. How the woman remembered her own name was a mystery.

His plan was to assure Rahel about Lydia's Bronfmann's progress, which frankly, wasn't very reassuring. The girl, a cutter and a bulimic, had been the reason he had to fire an excellent therapist, his old friend, Axel Friedman. She had four write-ups in her file, all for sexual misconduct. Her entire file was stuffed with carefully coded phrases: "Lydia is good at articulating her point-of-view" (i.e. obstructionist). "Perseveres at goals" (continues to have sex at drop of a hat). "Bulimic episodes lessoning (keeping her under lock-and-key was working). "Recommend single room" (can't get along with Estie Lattimer, the roommate).

What he could say definitively say about Lydia Bronfmann was that her \$12,000 --a-month fees were never late.

Parents like Rahel Bronfmann nee \_\_\_? came to Dr. Hazey to be reassured. He'd tried passing off this duty to Darlene when he promoted her to Head Therapist but Darlene had a problem with brutal honesty. She had no idea how to be reassuring without outright lying. When parents met with Darlene, she of the dour and sour personality, there went another monthly check that should have gone to Inner Horizons and ended up being written to the new Anorexia Unit at McLain, associated with Harvard, or to Visions Adolescent Treatment in Malibu where lucky patients got to surf. God, it was a dog-eat-dog-with-anxieties-world.

Hazey had long ago mastered the trick of hitting the right balance between avuncular reassurance and avoiding the red flag of hopelessness. Every parent wanted to know that their money was paying for progress when in fact almost every adolescent he'd ever met toyed with sitting down in the middle of the road and refusing to grow up.

Lydia wasn't any worse since she'd arrived last January.

She just wasn't any better.

By the time Rahel Bronfman Fiat, soon to be ex-Fiat Lydia had told him, sailed into Dr. Hazey's office, she was thirty minutes late. She waved a vague hand at him, simultaneously air-kissing Lydia on both cheeks. It flashed through Hazey's mind that perhaps the girl's mother missed her cheeks by an inch because her daughter truly didn't exist for her.

"You look so pretty, dear! Your hair..." A fluttering eyelid communicated that Rahel hated the mop of short black curls that Lydia had stopped straightening soon after registering a complaint that there wasn't a Brazilian wax technician in the entire state of Idaho. "It's so informal... so free." Rahel's voice was low and sexy with Detroit scrubbed out of it by either good schools or a voice coach.

Her mother smiled at her daughter with her delicate nose held high. From the narrow-eyed expression on Lydia's face, she seemed to thinking about ripping off Rahel's false eyelashes and shoving them up her cosmetically enhanced nostrils. She had two of them, didn't she? Two roads to hell, he could hear Lydia saying.

Rahel was a petite, dark-haired woman, a perfect clone of her daughter or, Hazey supposed, vice versa. Lydia, arms crossed on the couch next to her mother, was also tiny but rounded in that childlike way while her mother was tight and lean without an ounce of softness. Hips, narrow as a teenager, with calves like slip knots above excellent chiseled ankles. Clearly, Rahel's workout routine was more military than the Marines.

Lydia's mother's first concern was whether her daughter had put on any weight. "Lyd has a tendency to fat, like I do," Mrs. Bronfmann said, patting a wiry haunch that was as flat and wiry as a Greyhound. It was not hard to see where Lydia got her obsession with food.

Though the woman *was* attractive in a feral way. When she laid a hand on Hazey's arm---he'd made the mistake of pulling his wing back chair close to her---he felt like a cream puff awaiting her sharp teeth. "I hope you're helping my little girl," she said, her voice deep and throaty with concern. "Lydia's all I have."

"Rahel," Lydia said, "Dr. Hazey isn't my therapist. That's not his area."

Rahel said, "You're not being treated by the Head of the Program? Is that what you're saying?"

"I asked for a woman therapist," Lydia said. "You know. Because we get along so well." To this enigmatic statement, she gave Rahel a bland and sugary smile.

Hooboy.

When Hazey tried to probe gently about why Rahel didn't join the weekly calls for Lydia's family therapy, she said airily, "I've been out of the country" as if phones and Skype were yet to be invented.

"Even young adults can feel abandoned if a parent doesn't participate in their therapy," he said.

"Did she say something about me?" Rachel cried. "I'm a good mother!"

Hazey took the hint and smoothly deflected Rahel's claim, saying "I understand that Benjamin Bronfmann---your father? --- is the paternal figure in Lydia's life." Clearly, the key issue between mother and daughter wasn't going to be solved in a 45-minute conversation between Lear Jet refuelings.

"It's so good you're here. Lydia was very surprised when we told her about your visit," Hazey said. This was code for Lydia's crying jag and refusal to meet with her mother until she extorted an art class at NICC out of them, though she wasn't ready for that level of freedom. "Would you two like some time to yourself? I can step out of the room."

Both Rahel and Lydia looked at Hazey like he was going to abandon them in the middle of a fire storm. "No" Lydia cried, at the same time as Rahel was standind, saying, "No, no, Dr. Hazey. I'm only here to say hello and drop off Lydia's birthday present. You know she just turned 18 this week."

"Last month," Lydia said. "Mom and I have the same birthday.

"Isn't that extraordinary?" Rahel smiled. It was the same expression Lydia wore on her face when she said, "Only now Mom is 17 and I'm older than she is."

The clack of Rahel's departing heels jackhammered away at Hazey's overloaded brain. God, he needed that muscle relaxant. He absolutely couldn't. He had to control himself. He had to stay clear for his four o'clock therapy appointment with Old Girl.

Hazey had always enjoyed therapy. All kids, especially adolescent kids, with their mixture of on-the-money insights and immature ideals, fascinated him. Unfortunately, Old Girl was one of his few regular patients. He'd had to drop all his other long-term relationships so he could concentrate on intake assessments and parental management and the rest of the administrative load.

How was it that the thing that had gotten him into psychotherapy had been replaced by P&Ls and cash projections, things he loathed?

He wondered if Old Girl would be surprised to hear that he was attached to her. He'd fought tooth and nail to keep her on his crowded schedule though it was hell to keep seeing her three times a week. Albert Fox, his business manager, said over and over again it made no sense for Inner Horizon's founder to waste time treating patients when he should be "keeping the ship afloat."

As far as he was concerned the ship could sink if it didn't include Angela Livengood. She made him laugh. She continually surprised him ---and sometimes frightened him---with her wit, her surprisingly adult insights. And if he didn't get through to her, he was deathly afraid he was going to lose her.

Hazey had no idea how to get through to Old Girl's depression and suicide ideation. Suicide had been so much of part of her, life he couldn't seem to jolt her out of her rut. It was like she'd been on the path to her own destruction for so long that the dirt walls had built up over her head while the path she walked cut deep into granite. The girl was so far down in the canyon of despair she could barely see the stars above her.

He had to stay sharp or Old Girl would run rings around him and make him feel like even more of a shit heel. He was a shit. He was also lazy. He was unproductive. He wanted to get stoned. He absolutely would not let himself dip into his desk drawer for pick-me-up before his session with Old Girl.

Like all teenagers, Old Girl was self-obsessed and solipsistic. And he couldn't help liking her for it. The life force shone in her like the glint of copper he saw every now and then in those awful dreadlocks. Why a beautiful young woman would wear those dry cardboard scraps mystified the non-doctor part of him. The trained psychiatrist with nine weary years of graduate and post-doc studies behind him understood she was scared of her sexuality and she buried it in matted hair that looked like desiccated Medusa snakes.

Didn't she want a boyfriend? Sure, Hazey himself had made all the non-fraternization rules that kept Inner Horizons from becoming a bed hopping swap fest. But he would make an exception for Old Girl. What she needed was to accept the life in her, not to suppress it. And what better way than sex with one of her peers? That boy from Malibu---John? Justin? Jamison?---he was a good-looking, athletic kid and except for drug addiction and severe grief and depression as a result of killing a woman with his car, pretty well adjusted.

He sighed.

There was a reason for the No Fishing Off the Company Dock rules. Maybe Old Girl would meet a nice young man at Northern Idaho Community College now that she had graduated to taking classes after a year in Intensive. If a young man got through her defensive armor and death wish by waking up her sexual hormones and the biological imperative, maybe, Old Girl would choose to live.

One could only hope, the good doctor thought.

The bad doctor's hand was already reaching for the drawer that held the drugs.

3)  **091516 Lydia Punishes Herself**

All day, Lydia had kept a rigid balance sheet and by nine pm, it was time to see what it added up in her moral accounting. She went over today's score at the sink in the room she shared with Etsie while she flossed and brushed her teeth.

> 1\) Stealing \$20 from Darlene's purse.
>
> 2\) Slapping the shit out of James for refusing to have sex.
>
> 3\) Crying like a baby in front of her mother, then telling Dr. Hazey to fuck off.
>
> 4\) Joining in on the Estie torment with psychopath Danny and sycophant Reza, both of whom made her want to puke, then poking Estie until she lost it and stabbed Reza in the back of the hand with her fork.
>
> 5\) When they hauled Estie off to Stable, she grabbed Estie's dinner brownie and crammed it down her throat, puked it up in the Margaret's office, and left it fermenting in the garbage can so Margaret would smell it in the morning.

If she had been just middling bad, like on most nights, say she had laughed at James's big feet or poked fun at Big Paul for failing to lose weight or talked about the new girl's freaky fit in her hearing\-- she would have made herself sleep without a pillow. If her behavior was worse, like she'd ratted on someone for sneaking cigarettes (Maida) or shamed someone enough to make them cry during Process Group (Anton) or accidentally-on-purpose wiped up grape juice with a favorite cashmere sweater (Danny), she would have stripped the bed and made herself lie on the bare stained mattress.

It wasn't until she heard Charlene report at dinner that storm winds were gusting and the wind chill factor was forecast at five degrees below zero that her inner judge declared a trifecta. Bare floor. Open window. Nude.

Stripped down to camisole and bikini pants, she ran through her usual skin care routine, removing her make up and lathering French eye repair crème over and under her eyelids, exfoliating the dead cells from her face with a salt scrub, closing her pores with an astringent that smelled like sulfur and vinegar from the Dead Sea, thinking about how when the cat played with the mouse too long, it was time for atonement.

She'd cracked open as far as it would go at nine PM and by nine-thirty, it had already started to crystalize on the inside of the pane with ice diamonds. Her bare legs and feet felt the cold stealing across the floor and a prickle of skin on the back of her neck rose in anticipation of full body goose bumps.

She dropped her last layer of underwear and knelt at the side of the bed like a cloister penitent about to pray on bare knees. Instead, she settled on her side where she could see the drift of slowly swirling snowflakes chasing the heat away from the room. You made your bed, now lie in it, she told herself.

It was dim and silent. A silver glow from the waning moon reflected off the snow covered fields that led to the Kootenai River and and the pulp mill next to the train tracks. Healing House settled around her with arthritic creaks and groans. She forced herself to keep her eyes open so she could watch the slow progress of the moon creep up the far wall and crawl across the ceiling with a swath of blue light. You can close your eyes when the frost light touches you. Not before.

A whisper of frigid breeze brought up chill bumps up on her legs and arms. Quiet, she ordered herself to stop trembling.

You did this.

You're disgusting.

You're not even here.

4)  **Lydia's version of the meeting with her mother**

Six

Lydia fortified herself for her mother's visit with Seven for Mankind jeans, a Miu-Miu blouse and over-the-knee black Ferragamo boots. It was just that in her hollowed out, empty state, she kept having the out-of-body experience of shrinking and getting smaller until she had convinced herself that she wasn't even weighing down the couch.

The reason for the visit was that Rahel wanted to take her out of the Program so that she could take control of Lydia's maintenance allowance and live on her funds until her divorce settlement came through. Rahel explained her grand plan that would last "just a few months" with her brilliant carmine nails dancing in front of Lydia's face. At one point, she patted around in her new Balenciaga bag for a tissue and Lydia had a vision of being swallowed up by the black leather-braided bag and turning her into a bag shaped block that would be left on the luggage closet shelf until someone remembered to retrieve her. Lydia would have killed to leave the Program but she wanted to foil her mother's plans more.

"So I guess you're stuck with me," she told Dr. Hazey. The sound of her mother's heels clicked down the hall like a radioactive counter.

Hazey was peering out his window, with his back to her, seemingly mesmerized by the only black hole of open water that remained unfrozen on the parking lot that was Lake Couer D'Alene. The ice was relentlessly closing in on a flock of spinning coots that were chuckling and churning circles in the rapidly diminishing space. "That's good. I think."

He seemed to be asking a question.

"I thought you'd be happy that you weren't losing my fees," Lydia said.

"I think your mother is more unhappy at losing your fees than I would be." The loud bark of the front door punctuated his ambiguous smile.

"She'll get over it. She always does."

"Hmmm. Is that typical? Hazey asked as the radioactive clicking faded at the end of the hall.

"What?"

"For your mother to walk out on you?"

"Oh that was mild. The last time I saw her, she called me a little pervert and an ingrate."

"Well, is it unusual for your mother to lose her cool?"

"That wasn't losing her cool. You should see her when she's really mad." Lydia had seen her throw a drinking glass and hit a man's shoulder.

"What does she do when she's really mad?"

"She wouldn't see me for three years from the time I was almost 15 till I was 17."

"Want to tell me about that?"

"Not particularly."

Hazey sighed. He went to the locked file cabinet behind him and rifled through the B's till he found the Bronfmann file. He paged through the bulging sheaves before he found what he was looking for. "It says here that your grandfather charged your mother for lack of supervision for a minor and maintaining an unhealthy environment." The file also said that Rahel Bronfmann's fiance\' had been caught in bed with her daughter by the girl\'s nanny.

"So she blamed you?"

"Why do you think she called me an oversexed little ingrate?"

"So she's getting back at you by getting access to your finances?"

"She isn't too good with money, like she said."

"Actually, I think she's pretty darn good at getting it when she needs it."

The coots on the edge of the circle somehow managed to work their way into the inner circle so that the ones on the outside in the cold could depend on getting warm. Lydia wasn't sure how the system worked but sit seemed pretty elegant.

"Just out of curiosity, how big is your monthly allowance?" asked Dr. Hazey.

"It's not called an allowance any more. They changed it to a "maintenance allocation" when I turned 18. It's \$22,000 a month now that I'm technically an adult. I thought all this stuff was in there." She gestured to the file.

"Well I didn't know you are actually saving your trust fund by being here.\"

Lydia blinked. "What's it cost to keep me locked up?"

"\$12,000 a month, give or take."

"What's the take?"

"If we send you to Stabilization, you can add another \$3000 to the total."

"Oh, like an annuity."

Hazey's glance was sharp, as if he thought she was joking. Then he appeared to shift gear. "Did you want to have sex with your mother's fiance'?"

"He was a pig. If it meant she wouldn't marry him..."

Hazey said, "That's a lot of responsibility to put on a 14-year-old girl."

"What do you mean?"

"Saving your mother at 14."

"No, no. By then I was almost 15. She really couldn't see what a dick he was."

"Did you want to hurt her?"

"I was trying to help. She just didn't appreciate it so she stopped talking to me. That's when Grandpa Ben took over custodianship and I went to live in Grosse Point."

Hazey leaned toward her, hands tented in front of his face. "Lydia, you've been at Inner Horizons more than a year now. How would you characterize your progress?"

"I've been fucked up for 18 years. You don't think you can change me in only a year and a half, do you?" she countered.

"Actually, I don't think we can change you at all. You're the only one who can do that."

Lydia went over to the window to contemplate the circling coots in the small black pool. When she turned back, she caught sight of the large gold wrapped present her mother had left behind. "Can I open my present now? Before she comes back and takes it away?"

"Be my guest," he said with a little hand gesture.

She tore into the shiny foil paper which was surprisingly thick and stiff and made swift work of the clump of silver pine coins and red berries attached to a coil of silver fabric ribbon. She threw the lid off an interior box and peeled back a nest of snowy white tissue that covered a picture in a formal gold filigreed frame.

Lydia leaned in to peer at the image. Her stomach lurched a little sideways. Lydia's mother was sitting on a yacht in Portofino harbor next to a dark haired man. The man gazed at her in adoration one hand on a delicate high. Rahel was looking at the photographer while raising a glass of straw-colored champagne .

Lydia knew that photograph. And she knew it had been altered. The original had been taken the day before Rahel and Aldo Fiat were scheduled to get married in Church of St. George in Portofino, Italy. But it wasn't Rahel who was sitting on the white pristine yacht floating on the blue Mediterranean water. It was Lydia who had been next to Aldo on the formed fiberglass bow with the sun setting behind them. Her mother had taken the picture. Now she had somehow excised Lydia from the image as if she'd never been there.

Aldo squeezed Lydia's adolescent knee in one hairy hand while whispering in her ear, all his attention focused on her. Lydia's 14-year-old hand raised a straw colored glass of ginger ale in the air while her mother's 40-year-old face stared back at the viewer with a knowing smile. A low hum of distress sounded in the room and it took Lydia a second to realize the sound had come out of her body.

Dr. Hazey was watching her. "What's upsetting you about this picture?"

How to describe the happiness of that day without going into all the aftermath when Marlene, her east German nanny, walked in on Aldo thrusting like a piston into her skinny, breastless body?

"I was there," she said, pointing at her mother. "That's not her, that's me." She put her index finger on the picture, on the place where Aldo was stroking the inside of one knee under the fabric of her skirt. She still felt the red indentation of those cigar scented fingers. The black hairs that lined the back of his hands which were sparser than the black hairs she found on her later.

Hazey's eye brows were knotted with puzzlement as he tried to parse what she was saying. "You mean you were there when the picture was taken?"

"Yes. I was. I mean... no. I was sitting where she is. Mom was taking the picture and Aldo was sitting next to me with his hand on my knee." She stabbed at the large, sausage shaped fingers and looked up at Hazey.

"Mom had the photo retouched to get rid of me."

She had always liked Aldo. He was fun and funny, always joking around with the yacht boys and the masseuse and telling them dirty jokes that were too old for her in his Italian accented English. It bewildered he when she woke up to him lying on top of her, kissing her breasts and forcing her legs apart with his knee. She screamed when he started poking at her. It hurt like fire and it felt like he was both suffocating her with his weight and splitting her in two and it was the noise she made to defend herself, even as Aldo pressed one hairy hand over her mouth and hissed at her to take what he she'd been begging for, that woke up Marlene, the nanny, asleep in the next room.

"That's my leg, can't you tell? Look how skinny it is."

Hazey leaned closer and she heard his intake of breath when he saw where she was pointing.

"Why would your mother give this to you for your birthday?"

Therapists! Sometimes you had to do all the work because they were just too damn stupid to see what was right in their face.

"She wanted me gone," Lydia said. "Now you can't even tell I was ever there."

The raised glass of yellow bubbles. Aldo's laughing eyes. The delirious regard for the woman whose skirt he was pushing his hand under. Oh, to have never existed on that day the way her mother wanted.

"Your mother is a sick woman," Hazey said. "I hope you see that."

"She may be sick but she's the one in the picture."

Hazey countered. "You're here now," he said. "So you won't ever have to be in that position again."

Lydia was already closing up the white nest of tissue in order to press the picture back into in its paper nest.

"No," she said. "I doubt my Grandfather will ever let me live with her again."

"What about you, Lydia. Do you want to live with your mother?"

She turned hopeless eyes toward the churning birds that were spinning in the dark hole that was growing smalle.. "Every minute of every day. Crazy, huh?"

Hazey said. "I''m not surprised."

"Really?"

"Yes, really."

Lydia finally asked the question she'd been wanting to ask for years. "Dr. Hazey, who\'s crazier? Her or me?\"

"Yes," he said.

"Shit. I was afraid of that."

Her final question was one she'd thought about off-and-on for years, whenever she decided she was making progress in therapy and felt momentarily optimistic, if not hopeful. "Could you fix her if you worked with her?"

"You mean, if your mother was my patient? If I worked with her in therapy?"

"I know it's never going to happen.... But\--?"

"I don't fix people, Lydia. No therapist does."

"Well, what good are you?"

Dr. Hazey's expression tired, as if he were thinking about the fucked up relationship between mother and daughter and unhappy with his conclusion.

"I didn't say therapy wasn't helpful. All I said was that change is up to the individual."

"So you must work with a lot of patients who can't change. Doesn't that make you feel like a failure?"

"Out of the mouths of babes," he finally muttered under his breath.

The session ended with him saying he would bring Darlene up to speed on their sessionthis afternoon. "No doubt you'll be revisiting this conversation."

For no reason Lydia could name, one of Aldo's hoary old jokes came back to her like a ghost. "Dr. Hazey, do you happen to know the definition of eternity?"

"Can't say I do."

"Two people, a ham and their relationship with their mother."

Hazey laughed, despite himself.

070116 Lydia walks the road

Louisa write

She wondered what happened to the bitterbrush and choke cherry and other shrubs when they were weighted down by months of snow. Were they crushed? Flattened? Or just broken and dead now under the deep snow that covered them.

From a distance, the road looked like a smooth white ribbon but underneath, it was pitched and rutted and treacherously slippery underfoot. It felt like she was lifting a weight with each footfall. Frankie had wrapped the laces around her ankles several times but her feet flopped and skated the oversize boots they were looking for a way out.

She wasn't afraid when she saw the cat. Something wet and dripping hung from its fangs. Too big to be a vole. A ground squirrel. A rabbit? Its fangs were dark with blood. The crack of a bone made her jump.

The cat appraised her for a long moment. Then it turned, prey still in its mouth, and melted off between the firs and pines on the downhill side of the road.

It didn't seem real to her until the black spots on the ground where it had been eating came away from her fingers dark and tacky. The blood was already freezing in the cold along with a small pile of the rabbit's purple-blue viscera that emits a ghost of steam.

She holds one hand up to the light to inspect her fingers and it jogs her memory of the handprint she's left below the level of the seat cushion in Jed's truck. Something to remember her by, she was thinking. Proof that she existed in that moment in time. It seemed so much more real to her than the present moment alone and shivering among the dark and silent trees.

In the cab, she had expected rough sex and a beating but in her wildest imaginings, she couldn't have predicted that Jed would leave her out in wilderness not knowing where she was or how to find her way back to civilization.

"No fucking way, peckerwood. She's not riding with us." Jed screamed at Frankie.

When Frankie tried to put her in the truck bed under the tarp, Jed started punching him. "Not in my truck!" he cried. "Let the bitch walk."

"Walk or die," Frankie told her before Jed forced him back in the truck and they drove away.

Getting to her feet took a monumental act of will. She'd made the mistake of closing her eyes after the last bout of Jed's choking and head butts. It felt good to just lie in the cold snow where Jed had thrown her down. He'd lost interest in fucking her when the Ecstasy kicked in, and entertained himself by kicking her while she lay on the ground. The shot-up lawn mower at her eye level had so many holes, it looked like a sieve.

Frankie touched her cheek and said, "Your eye is fucked." Then he aimed her downhill and said, "Just follow our tracks. I-90's a coupla miles."

Lydia couldn't see anything on the right side, just a reddish haze. She wiped at a snail trail of something wet that dripped something wet in the neck of the jacket. Her balance wasn't working very well. She had to re-aim herself every few steps so she didn't walk off the the downslope.

The second time she fell, getting up seemed like a task for someone else. Her head felt big and alien and with unable to see out of one eye, she wondered if she'd been turned into a Cyclops. Frankie's grimace told her that her face was more than just messed up. She was unrecognizable now, even to herself.

Why not just lie back and watch the snow snakes blown by the wind on the road carve the ruts into edges that were sharp as blades.

The only thing that got her up and stumbling again was the crunch of teeth on bones. Twenty yards past a bend in the road, a mountain lion was on its haunches, chewing on something furred and steaming. She had a fleeting wish that she had a stick, something to make herself look big, but then it melted into the dark trees dragging its prey with it.

After that, she forced herself to stumble on like a drunk, listing and bent over the posture of an old broken crone. Frankie O's warning to "walk or die" was in her thoughts but after walking on and on, the words turned into the words of a parrot that were repeated again and again until they had no meaning. She was so tired. Her feet kept sliding in the boots. When one foot slipped out in front of her and the left caught on a chunk of rock, she went down with a gasp. She was on her back looking up at tiny ice chips of light so distant, she felt invisible.

"I'm here with you now," she heard Lorenzo say to her amid the rustle and clank of the student cafeteria. But the wind soughing in the pines didn't seem right. It was beautiful in the silvered moon light. All around her the snow looked soft and pillowy. Tussocks and hillocks had flattened to rumpled bed clothes. There were no more hills to climb. No more road to descend. A soft build up of snow was whitening her exposed thighs, a product of the light but ever colder wind. One calf, blue in the silvery light, looked like meat shrink wrapped in a freezer. She closed both eyes and let darkness steal over her. She wasn't cold. A numbing sensation reached inward toward her bones. The absence of pain and the calm that settled over her was beautiful.

Everything in the forest looked alien and strange. A boulder with a cap of snow became a crouching bear. The sound of Hayden Creek as it talked to itself and muttered kept her company.

They parked in a clearing that was cut into a hillside in a semi-circle.

After leaving occasional yellow lights of far flung ranches, they climbed slowly but steadily until they got to a flat space carved in the side of a butte.

070216 Fragments of Lydia at night

White road. Flat from a distance. Uneven and lumpen up close. She stumbles, rights herself, lists. Jed shoves. Brays.

Clink-whoosh of a Bud.

"On your knees."

A fist knocks her down. A ring of fire in one ear. Prodding. "Ass up." "Now!"

Another slap. A pumping and tearing between her leg.

Snow whirls. Stars like pricks of light. A scudding sky of clouds with a silver moon.

Panting. Crunching.

The side of her head lights up with a red haze. "Told you to get up!"

Grunts. Stab in her kidneys. Explosion in her side. She feels a great weight on her spine. Jed jerk her head up by the hair.

Hands at throat. Silvery light turns red. Then black. No air.

> Frankie O is yelling. Enough! Stop or you'll kill her.\
> Jed: Still kicking. "Killer if I want to. Teach her to shame me!"
>
> A flurry of kicks scrapes her face in snow.

Frankie: "Get up. Keep walking. Don't lie down. Don't sleep."

Frankie's words are meaningless. "Go to sleep and you'll freeze" becomes "Go to sleep." Freeze sounds good when red heat lights up her kidneys like a match. Her head rings. Something weeps from one eye. She squints. Sees black.

She has the impression that her right eye---the one she can't see out of anymore---is melting. Every few steps she takes, she wipes. Swipes. In the moon light, her sleeve turns black.

As long as she keeps her blind eye turned up hill she can keep herself from walking off the edge of the road. Stop. Re-aim. Lumber along a few halting steps. Sway. Stand still until her head stops ringing.

A soft sighing sound drifts into her consciousness from the black firs that are bent down from the weight of snow. "Someone there?" Her voice sounds thin, hoarse and raw.

The first time she falls, she face plants in the snow. A boulder appears at her knee without warning. She props one arm on it. Pushes up to her knees. Manages to drag herself up on two feet but has to catch her breath before she can move.

She stumbles into a juniper bush. Snow drifts on the road surface like blowing sand. A dark, bare spot under the spreading white wings of a tree beckons. Branches. The snowy arms look welcoming. Crawl under them for a rest.

"Don't get off the road. Keep walking." Frankie's words buzz in her head like a mosquito or a gnat bedeviling her to get up. If she crawls off the road, she'll be out of sight. Under cover. In the well of a tree with its spreading wings. She's so tired. What is so bad about letting herself sleep?

The snap of a broken branch. She jerks up. She's gazing hopefully among the trees and stumps for a sight of something moving in the still silent forest. The hair on the back of her neck stand up at the sound of teeth crunching into bone.

A large cat crouches at the bend of the road with something wet and furry in its mouth. A mouth full of blue-purple entrails. Yellow eyes fix on her own while it chews.

Somehow she's on her legs, poised to run. At the sudden movement, the cat rises gracefully to its feet. It turns its head towards her. In profile, it's the size of a German shepherd. Sighting from its eyes down its spine to a twitching tail, it is so thin that it could stand between two rushes without disturbing them. The cat pads away with its prey moving uphill without effort. Black spots on the snow. Proof that it wasn't a ghost.

Fear has long fled. The time in the clearing with Jed has stripped her of all feeling. What could happen when the worst has already been done?

She rounds the next bend, walking bent over in the tracks in the road. Jingling. The jingle of chains from I-90. Truck lights pulsing white. Red. A red Vacancy sign at the RV Court in the distance calls to her.

She wants to will her feet forward. Wants to move the boots toward the yellow cone of porch light. An open door that spills firelight. A rag rug to lie down on. It's the promise of the rag rug so close she can almost feel its plaited whorls on her cheek that causes her to curl up on her side under the arms of a tree off the road. She feels the yellow light a mile away. Falls asleep with its warmth so close and comforting, she can feel it.

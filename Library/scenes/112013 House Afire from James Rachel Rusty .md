112013 House Afire from James Rachel Rusty

Rachel had a burning desire to break through the phalanx of firefighters and beat down the backdoor. How could she have left her photo album in the room?

Old Girl had shaken her roughly awake yelling fire. \"Grab your clothes and get out!\" she yelled back at her from the door. Rachel heard her screaming and pounding doors on the way down the hall. While she was scrabbling around in the dark for shoes and pants. The electricity was out. A sharp acrid smell of creosote filled the air. In the dark, eyes tearing and burning, she managed to grab her Church pants, the good ones, off their hanger and stuffed her cowboy hat on her head. The pants went on over her pajama bottoms and she didn\'t bother with socks.

She tried to go out the back door but an ominous glow of orange was visible under the laundry room door and when she touched the wood it was hot. She flew the opposite direction, passing open doors and kids spilling out in various states of undress. Everybody shouted, \"Coat! Where\'s my fucking coat!\" \"Hurry,\" \"Where\'s Charleen?\" \"It\'s fucking freezing.\" \"What happened to the electricity.\"

The safety strip in the hall made all the frantic actions ghastly and surreal.

Charleen came roaring down the hall and nearly bowled her over. \"Grab something warm and go!\" She was calling out names from her Duty list but all the ducklings had scattered like a stick of dynamite had been tossed in their midst.

It wasn\'t till Rachel hit the deep freeze outside that she regretted her bare ankles[.]{.underline} She stuffed her arms in the light rain jacket she was carrying, it was the 1^st^ jacket that she\'d been able to put her hands on in the dark.

By then a stream of lost souls emptied out of Healing House like refugees fleeing with only the clothes on their backs.

Reza hopped around skinny white and hairy legs, sticking out of tighty-whiteys like an old man. A striped blue bath towel hung down his shoulders like a kid\'s idea of a cape.

\"Have you seen Old Girl?\" Rachel asked. Fire trucks screamed in the distance and men with walkie talkies called out orders to people driving in cars.

Reza said, \"Old Girl woke me up. She\'s over there. \" He pulled a hand out of the King\'s robe getup to wave in the direction of the garage where the staff slept.

Rachel spotted Old Girl from the back. She was wearing the backpack where she kept her life and something about Old Girl\'s unflappability in a moment of crisis made her think of the photo album she\'d abandoned on her desk.

Bright fingers of flame were reaching out of the room next to the laundry room where a firefighter chopped furiously on the roof with an axe.

With a sick feeling she envisioned the flannel sheets and blankets she\'d been buried in a few minutes before bursting into flame next to neatly pasted photos of her mother with her dad and Trisha and Richard Nixon the dog and Rachel\'s 10 year old self 2 long skinny braids parting her head.

James came up behind Rachel, who was shivering with her arms crossed around herself. No wonder. She wore a U of Illinois running jacket against the F2^o^ temperature-- he\'d heard firefighters reporting wind chill of -10^o^ and no cloud cover which seemed to be Idaho speak for cold and feeling colder. They were all crowded behind some kind of fire line made of tape, patrolled by an officious greasy haired man in a shiny coat. \"Stay back you kids,\" he kept saying. \_ the line. Stay out of the way.\"

James had grabbed a couple wool blankets from his bed. He\'s already wrapped one around his shoulders so he took the other one and wrapped it around Rachel form behind, circling her body with his arms to trap her body heat and hold it closed.

She looked over her shoulders at him in surprised which is when James saw snail tracks of tears running down her cheeks. \" You\'re ok,\" he said, tightening his hold on the blanket. \"You\'re safe.\"

She laughed a watery litter laugh and shook her head. \"I\'m not scared,\" she said. \"I lost my photo album. It\'s in there.\' She waved toward the sparks and licking orange light. High above the roof, blackened bits of ash floated toward stars that were brilliant and sharp as diamonds.

\"I\'m sorry,\" James said.

Lydia wandered by in Ugg boots up to her knees and sleeping shorts printed with flying donuts. It was the 1^st^ time he\'s seem her without a mask of makeup and she looked like she was in middle school. She looked shell shocked, like a starving skin-and-bones refugee when he was used to seeing her armed with perfect clothes and perfect hair and a closed face.

To his surprise Rachel opened her arms and beckoned Lydia into her blanket. \"Come in out of the cold, you ding dong,\" Rachel said. Lydia actually turned and looked behind her to make sure meant her not someone standing near her. \"Yes you, silly. You\'re freezing to death.\"

If you had been able to look down on the three residents of Healing House say from the top of the Ponderosa pine that guarded the property, you would have seen old \_ Indian blanket hug with tow blankets and three people who needed to get warm. James stretched his blanket around \_ and Rachel, and Rachel encircled Lydia with hers and they all leaned into each other. They were warm and supported for the moment, when is all there was .

Rusty Barrow, warm in his shiny neon striped firefighting jacket frowned at the tall blond kid who was feeling up the ponytailed girl in a Pendleton blanket.

Rusty had been about to walk up to her and ask her to sit in the truck. He could blast the heat up to high and tell her he was one of the first responders on the scene- this was true since he\'d waited in the crawl space until everyone went to bed so he could light the turpentine soaked rags he\'d been saving. He\'s left them in the garbage can like somebody\'s trash. That fat girl, Charleen, who went to grade school and junior high with him before he dropped out kept coming back and forth into the laundry room. Every time he thought she was done, he\'d hear her heavy tread and the witch would be back turning on the washer for another load. He\'d finally laid down and taken a short snooze until the hours was silent as a tomb. It worked out nice that she was too stupid to clean out the lint trap. He watched the match eat the cotton lint like a snake before he heard the whoosh of turpentine fueled rags. The garbage was burning merrily, shooting flames like clawing fingers up the curtains when he walked out into the night though the back door.

He\'d called in the fire on the \$35 prepaid virgin mobile phone he\'d bought then tossed the thing in the middle of the snowfield he\'d parked next to. Whatever happened to reach out and touch someone? a jingle he remembered from television. Or Mighty Mouse? You never saw ol\'Mighty or his girlfriend anymore. She was a screamer he remembered. But Mighty always saved the day.

His plan was working like clockwork, until the tall kid stuck a spoke in the works, him and his fucking blanket. There was something going on in front of him and he didn\'t like it. Rachel was his screamer, not the blond kid\'s. She was leaning back against his chest with her eyes closed. He couldn\'t see the tiny curly haired girl at all because the blanket Rachel held around her covered her from head to toe. The tall kid's glance passed over Rusty\'s glare then swiveled back so that they locked eyes. A little frown flitted over the kid\'s face like he was wondering who Rusty was. \"You\'ll know my name soon enough you pissant,\" Rusty said to himself. Rachel\'s a screamer but so are you.

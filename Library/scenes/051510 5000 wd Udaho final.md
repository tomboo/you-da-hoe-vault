**Udahoe**

By Cynthia Hartwig

**Process Group**

Old Girl -- she refused to answer to any other name --ended up at Inner Horizons for trying to off herself. She had three official tries on her record, but she\'d actually been experimenting with suicide since she was twelve. It just wasn't that easy when you only had the life experiences of Hello Kitty. Peggy and David (her guardians) had a well- stocked medicine cabinet but it took a lot of trial and error to figure out what was lethal. How was she supposed to know that taking a super-size bottle of laxatives would only make her want to die, instead of killing her outright? At Inner Horizons, she had individual therapy three times a week and every-other-day Process Groups like the one underway. Was it any wonder that within a day of being locked up in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho, everybody called the place Udahoe? Get it? U -- Da -- Hoe, for doing whatever fucked up shit that landed you in a residential psychiatric program with people even more fucked up than you.

Old Girl had recently moved to Young Adults (18-24) from Adolescents (3-17). She couldn't see any difference in the level of maturity unless she counted the improvement in psychobabble. All eight of the morons now sprawled out in an irregular circle of couches and chairs could spout on about accountability and self-actualization and self-validation but what they were really experts at was what they were doing now: arguing about whose turn it was go first.

Darlene, the Head Therapist, settled it by introducing the newest member of the program like a cheerleader -- "Rachel Interlachen! Yay!" \-- while Old Girl watched an icicle spear on the eaves get longer. The Idaho equivalent of watching paint dry. Last night, newbie-Rachel had been frog-marched into Healing House by two Christ-spouting "escorts" in matching ski jackets which meant that Mommy and Daddy had paid a bundle to avoid a plane ride with their flipped-out, possibly violent and sobbing girl in order to get her out of their hair. She wore a short-sleeved tee shirt that said "Give Up the Ghost." On her arms, where everyone could see them, horizontal cut marks. Not vertical. Garden-variety self-injurer, Old Girl concluded, like the majority. Get prepared, newbie, they already took away your hair straightener (so you can't burn yourself) and your perfume (so you can't drink it) and the only knife you'll see will be in the hands of a fat cook who commits hate crimes against food.

Old Girl followed the newbie's gaze out the picture window to the wall of snow that had begun falling in October and was apparently going to drag on until May. Rachel Interlachen appeared to still be in the honeymoon stage with Idaho, imagining lakes as blue as Stellar's jays and endless diamond sparkled peaks. She had the endless part right. Wait till she was trapped by sub-zero temperatures that split your head open when you went outside and emotional dramas fifty times a day. Old Girl covered her head with a pillow by 8 p.m., she was so exhausted by all the anxieties pulsing in the air around her. Escape to anywhere looked like nirvana. All Old Girl's failures had inured her to the sense of suicides' permanence; she was convinced she was doomed to come back for more suffering. Ground Hog Day, a movie she had watched with her mother in the happy haze of childhood, was her idea of existence. You tried to kill yourself in ever-inventive ways and you always woke up to make another attempt. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

"Let's welcome Rachel to her new family!" terminally cheerful Darlene chirped. Family! Everybody in the program was just as fucked up and dysfunctional as a real family, except none of the participants would have forked out \$12, 000 a month to share Cheerios. Darlene's voice took Old Girl back to an ancient memory of nap time, when Mom used to let her lie on her bedspread with a graham cracker while listening to stories with happy endings. Here, there were no graham crackers -- at Inner Horizons, you snacked on carrot sticks between meals because of the overload of anorexics in the program -- and no stories that Old Girl knew of with happy endings. There was James Olson, the loser Darlene ordered to go first in'"taking ownership of his behaviors."

James, 19, a surfer-blond,was not yet used to his height (he was famous for tripping over his own feet) He ticked off his sins in a flat voice. "Substance abuse, alcohol abuse, DUI, school suspension, lost my license and...." James pinched the area between his eyebrows, like it hurt his head to remember, "...littering."

Yuk. Yuk. Old Girl had heard the joke before.

Maxi Eaton, a pale skinny girl with the twangy sing-song of a Texan went next: "An-or-EX-i-A, Bu-LIM-i-a, self-in-JURE --y\..."

Old Girl felt for the newbie who eyed the ceiling like she was looking for an escape hatch. She wondered if all Rachel's cutting had aged her like Old Girl's suicide tries had aged her. She didn't insist on people calling her Old Girl because she was currently the longest tenured resident of Inner Horizons. Old Girl was how she felt: ancient and achy in her bones, tired to death of existence, like a hundred-year-old blind and deaf person, longing for release.

Princess Leia, the nympho from Westchester, New York, ran through her behaviors staring directly at James. "Sex addiction, inappropriate touching, prostitution, sexual harassment of a teacher, lewd conduct..." Here, Leia took out her gum and licked her fingers one by one.

"Come on, Leia, we don't have all day," said Darlene.

"...coercing a police officer with a blow job." Leia shrugged, bobbing black curls over diamond earrings the size of teardrops. "It worked with his partner."

Cocaine addiction, glue huffing, predatory sex, shoplifting, peer violence, theft, assault and battery, sibling abuse, incest, road rage, gambling addiction, exposure, fire starting, property destruction: if it hurt you or the people who loved you, the Inner Horizons family had tried it.

When the circle looped back, Darlene urged Rachel, "Tell us about you. What behaviors can you own up to?"

Rachel hunched shoulders drawn in as if to protect her heart. She opened her mouth like a fish. Old Girl got the impression that there was not enough air in the room passing over her gills. She stood up and swayed. Then toppled backwards, legs buckling at the knees, straight into James Olson's lap.

\* \* \* \*

James got to Process Group late. It wasn't like being late was a tragedy. In Kook D'Alene, Idaho, James was surrounded by the lame and halt, all with parents who could afford to throw two brand new Mercedes off a cliff like his parents: Dad, CEO of a heart defibrillator company, and Dr. Mom, a cardiologist, both used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh, his therapist, reminded him in session. When are you going to grow up? Josh had asked. James' answer. You're the professional. You tell me.

"What the shit?" James cried when the new girl landed with her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James hung in the rearview mirror of his 18^th^ birthday Corvette. Exorcist time. He had the weird perspective of looking at her face upside down. Her pupils were rolled up like a window shade, a white unfollowable map with tiny red capillaries.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair yelling, "Get Bruce!" Then, at Leia, "Call 9-1-1!"

By this time, the girl was flopping like a carp on the carpet and everybody in Process Group perched at the edge of their seats as if they were at the multiplex. James felt torn between being thankful to the blond for providing something different to talk about and being appalled at the sight of Bruce, the day manager, kneeling on her elbows while Darlene grappled her by the ears.

James held on to an ankle and felt something like a shock wave circling through the girl's body, as if he were holding onto a person being electrocuted. Her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, even though James held on with full strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying on of hands on a person seized by electricity, as if a bolt of lighting had struck-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process Group wisdom. The body has a will and an agenda all its own. His eyes met Darlene's \-- and he wondered if the bodily high-jacking shook her as much as it shook him.

After an eternity of convulsions, the blond girl's eyes --a bruise-dark blue -- popped open. Her eyes darted around the cluster of unfamiliar faces and James had the impression she was wondering if she'd died and gone to hell. Consciousness spread slowly over her face. The monster is out of the closet---and it is me, James read.

"Are you feeling better?" Darlene was asking as she struggled to sit up. James squeezed her fingers, thin and fragile as bird bones. The girl automatically squeezed back, then catching his eye, dropped his hand as if she'd been burned.

Because Healing House was twenty miles outside of town, Darlene and Bruce decided to load her into the Suburban and take her to the hospital; it was faster than waiting for an ambulance. They put Micah, a Junior Counselor, in charge.

After that, Process Group was officially toast. Everybody sat around and replayed the moment when the new girl lost it. Maxi Eaton, the anorexic-bulimic who never thought of anything but food, said, "I thought she was going to barf up breakfast." Reza, the Rage Against the Machine fanatic, wanted to know how come she didn't piss her pants.

"They must have known she was epileptic!" Angela, the mean girl who'd been at the program longer than any of them, was pissed. "What the fuck's wrong with the program? They should know stuff like that."

Angela wouldn't speak to James, a short timer of only six weeks (an eternity, in his mind). How was he supposed to know she called herself Old Girl when somebody told him her name was Angela? Excuuuuuse me. Usually James avoided Old Girl rather than give her the chance to rip him apart with her razor tongue. She was pretty scary with that head full of long, ginger-colored dreads and an unnerving I-don't-give-a-fuck look that he was familiar with at the bottom of a tequila bottle. So he surprised himself when he said, "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you plan for."

A mammoth kid named Paul, who never ever said a word, spoke up. "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like they'd heard a ghost.

"What the hell are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her skull!"

They all laughed, and Paul went back to humming his tuneless song. James felt Leia bump him from behind, the sign she wanted to have sex. As usual, Leia's timing was impeccable.

**Outdoor Activity**

They were supposed to leave at eleven but everybody was still running around trying to find their snow gear so it was closer to the crack of noon. Old Girl, ski-hatted, sweating in puffy down, waited at the front door like a pre-schooler. Where was the mitten leash that went through both arms of the coat and around her neck?

It reminded Old Girl of waiting at the front door for Mom to wrestle Gabe into his snowsuit. Because she was three years older, she could dress herself while Gabe, the baby, had to be crammed into his clothes like a sausage. She could still see Mom holding him between her legs and coaxing him to stomp down to get his square little foot corked in the boot. Old Girl half-imagined a pop when the foot finally slipped in. Did it bloop? Or was it more like a thwock? The reverse of a champagne cork. What was Gabe doing during all the pushing and shoving? She searched her treasure trove of memories in the sun-dappled Before of her life, and came up blank. Gabe was a smiler-- not the colicky screamer she was, according to Peggy, her mother's sister, and now her guardian with David, Peggy's husband, in the perpetual After. Her mind was empty as an ice-covered lake. Something was erasing her happiest moments around the edges. She couldn't remember Dad's smell like she used to. She used to be able to call him up -- he was a builder \-- by smelling fresh-cut wood. Now, when she carried kindling and split logs for the woodstove, all she smelled was pitch. Dad was gone, escaped up the chimney and released into the frigid air, even further gone than the night Peggy held her on her lap and told her a half-blind senior citizen had crashed his Cadillac and taken out all three of them.

The sky was the usual color of cement. They hammered along Highway 95 toward Lake Pend O'Reille (Pon-der-ay, that's how Idahoans said it). A French name from some ancient trapper who came looking for beavers to slaughter. No beavers here, just twelve kids squirrelly from being trapped on top of each other. They hadn't been let out for Outdoor Activity for almost a month because of the storms. Some country sob song wailed on the radio, Prayin' for daylight, waitin' for that morning sun. People sang into fists held like fake microphones. Old Girl had never gotten used to the noise. When Aunt Peggy shipped her out after Old Girl ate a bottle of Valium, the first thing she understood had been taken away was a quiet place to hear herself think.

Barely five miles out of town, James and Leia got a warning for inappropriate touching and were separated. Now James sat next to the driver in the front, so his wandering hands couldn't reach Leia's crotch and Rachel Interlachen slumped against the window next to him. There had been a big debate among the staff about whether she should be allowed to come on the hike, but she'd checked out okay at the hospital. Old Girl got stuck with Princess Leia in the far back.

Barfland was glacial. Luckily, Leia had screwed in her IPod and hip-hop rhythms leaked out her ear buds so Old Girl didn't have to pretend she was interested in how many times Leia had traded oral sex for candy in the past week. Blowjobs are money, Leia told her one day.

Old Girl contemplated the white world beyond Inner Horizons. Frankly, it looked pretty much like the view from Healing House with endless blue trees and a landscape where nothing moved. What would it be like to walk out into the white and keep walking? How long would it take before you were far enough away from civilization to lie down and sleep? About a mile was Old Girl's calculation. Less if the temperature dropped and it snowed.

The plan was to snowshoe up to a lake north of Priest River. It was supposed to take a couple hours. For the millionth time, Old Girl missed her own IPod but it had seen stolen by some asshole two weeks ago. Old Girl had dark plans for the thief that involved pressing a piece of glass she found on the street to the asshole's windpipe. She fingered the sharp edge of the triangular shard in her pocket. Sharp enough to slice her finger pad with a tiny bit of pressure, apparently. She tried it, idly, like nibbling at the edge of a cake. Just enough to give herself a little taste until she could have the whole slice.

\* \* \* \*

The trail climbed gently for a mile. James was glad to stretch his legs on something other than a treadmill in an unheated barn. If he ever made it out of Intensive to Transition, he wanted to be in shape to play ball again. Would the move be like moving from one circle of hell to the next? To combat the mind-numbing boredom, he'd been working his way through The Inferno from the rag-tag library, not that he'd ever let on to his parents. They'd long since given up on the idea that James would ever be interested in anything but X --Box.

It quieted down once the going got steep. Leia lagged behind. She was still in a snit about how James had wrestled her hand away from his crotch, which was how they got caught. James would have given her a black mark too. Reaching down his pants in plain sight was idiotic. Demeaning. Was he a piece of meat? He had been happy to be the meat when she first came on to him, but now James felt increasingly wary. The incident behind the shower curtain, when Darlene rushed in to pee (he caught a glimpse of her ski jacket), would have gotten both of them sent to Stabilization, the medicated gulag somewhere even deeper in the hinterlands of Idaho than Healing House. James wasn't interested in moving lower on Inner Horizon's circles of hell. Intensive already ranked right up there with the frozen lake of ice and traitors to kindred all around.

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy Leia's blowjobs, or the novelty of sex in the women's bathroom on the community school campus where he was taking Intro to Psychology, Intro to Sociology and Intro to Humanities. (Progress! His mother enthused on the phone.) He wished there was an Intro to Life. Lately, he'd been getting the feeling that Leia's was motivated by risk rather than any feeling of connection with him. He wasn't looking for love, he told himself. It would be nice to be liked.

The new girl tramped steadily behind him. She was keeping up with him and they were way ahead of the pack so she must be in shape. Old Girl, on their heels, didn't count because she spent hours on the treadmill every day and James was always having to trade his allowance so she'd let him have his forty-five minutes of pain. Five bucks! What kind of trouble could you get in with a five? James remembered the day Dad handed him \$50 for his first allowance. The look on Mom's face when she found the stash of licorice he bought.

Giant snow-shrouded Ponderosa pines pinched off the intermittent sun on the trail. It wasn't that cold \-- not for Idaho --maybe twenty-five degrees?

"Rachel!" somebody called, and she stepped on the back of James' snowshoe and he almost fell. "Sorry!" she said. James kneeled to reorient his snowshoe and tighten the strap. "It's okay, I was dreaming."

"Maybe we should wait for the others?" Rachel's tone was tentative, like she didn't have the right to make a suggestion. She seemed worried about Inner Horizon's rules, after the stay-together lecture they got at the trailhead. Old Girl passed, stepping out of the trail and skirting them without a word. So much for waiting, James thought. "It's okay. As long as the three of us hang together."

He fell in behind Old Girl. The stillness was profound. No foot tracks---just the soft skitter pads of some four-footed creature. A fox? James would like to see a fox. Not many wild animals in Malibu. Unless you counted Sly Stallone, who lived next door. What he'd really like to see is a wolf. He'd settle for an elk. Something majestic. If he saw an elk, he'd have something safe to talk about with Dad and Dr. Mom on the weekly family torment call. Why didn't his parents just give it up and accept that he was a loser? Not everybody could be like his sister, Susan, with A's on every report card, accepted by Yale and Princeton, which took a month of agonizing dinnertime debate while James hoped his report card hadn't arrived. He checked the mail faithfully but once he started coming home drunk or stoned, who knew what fell through the cracks? A shit load, he guessed.

**\* \* \* \***

A sound like breaking glass. Thrashing and breathy snorts like a horse in distress. Old Girl and James raced up ahead of Rachel on the shadowed trail, fast as fleeing deer. An odd whinnying that didn't sound like any horse Rachel had ever heard in her junior riding days, got louder, more hysterical, as she ran.

By the time she reached the lake, the moose was already tiring. Rachel could see the cloven hoof prints that lead to a jagged-edged pool a hundred yards from shore. A moose floundered in dark, roiling water, its fore-hooves trying to scrabble a purchase on the edge of the ice. The moose would lunge part way up, heaving its massive withers onto the shelf and then the ice would break with its weight. Every time it managed to get up, another ledge of ice would shear off. The black water was dotted with snow clumps that shuddered and bobbed while the creature swam in circles.

"How can we help?" Old Girl's voice went high and tight. Even in Rachel's astonishment at the sight, she registered the fracture of Old Girl's careful facade. So she has a heart flitted through her mind as the moose made another lunge. It had a huge rack of antlers and its eyes rolled in terror.

"We need a stick!" Old Girl yanked at a clump of timber trapped at the shore. She got her hands on a branch and used her body weight to try to break it off at the trunk.

"What's it going to hold on with?" James dismissed the idea. "Don't even think about going out there!"

"Maybe we can lever it up. Just enough to help it onto the thicker ice." Old Girl addressed Rachel and with both girls jumping, the branch splintered. Rachel had the ice- laden branch in her bare hands when the moose made a final heave. It fell helplessly back. Then it gave up. For a few unearthly seconds, as they gazed in amazement, the sun lit the candelabra points of the antlers with a blaze of fire. Then the antlers slipped under without a sound, and the only sign that the moose had been there were a few slowing whorls in the jagged hole.

When the rest of the group broke onto the shoreline, Josh was the one who spotted the snow blotted hole.

"Looks like something fell through. Anybody guess what?"

Rachel opened her mouth to tell them about the moose but Old Girl slipped sideways, nearly knocking her off her snowshoe. What the\--? James busily inspected a clump of sad aspen saplings with some kind of blight.

"Jesus, watch where you're going." Rachel yanked her foot away, taking the hint.

Reza said it was a bear. "Look. You can see its claw marks."

James rolled his eyes. "It's winter, dumb ass. Bears are in hibernation." Somebody else saw the cloven tracks and thought a deer fell through. Other suggestions included elephants, giraffes, Godzilla and Dr. Ballrich, the head of the program.

A few light snowflakes ended the nature lesson. Josh made them turn back toward the Suburban before the snow got serious.

Rachel thought about James squeezing her hand during her seizure. Didn't he realize she had wet her pants? Or was there a God and the black pants she always wore like a uniform had protected her like she hoped? When James turned away from the sapling with a lopsided little grin, and took up a position right behind her on the trail, as if he wanted to watch over her, her heart gave a tiny lurch.

**Med Check**

Rachel was surprised when she got back to Healing House to learn that her stuff had been moved into Old Girl's room. Bu the time she unpacked, Old Girl said it was time for 8:00 Med Check. The nurse, Gloria, was counting out pills into rows of plastic cups. Margaret, the cook, who seemed better at counting pills than she was at following a recipe, checked the contents of a little cup of colorful brain candy against her clipboard for a girl named Angela. Rachel had gotten good at reading upside down in the early days of her epileptic seizures. Her head felt stuffed with cotton batting and it was the only way she could track what they were giving her. Angela's cup overfloweth, she thought, reading the long list of meds on the chart. Almost as many as in Rachel's cup which had all her epilepsy drugs plus anti-anxiety this, anti- depressant-that.

"Who's Angela Livengood?" she asked Old Girl. "I haven't met her yet."

Old Girl arched an eyebrow. "You don't want to. She's a bitch."

Inner Horizons seemed to have a lot of bitches, Rachel thought. Like the one who had rifled her suitcase and stolen her new, never-worn Lulu Lemon pants before she even had a chance to unpack. "How so?"

Angela held a coppery dreadlock in front of her eyes, making her look both demented and purposeful. "For one thing, she'll rip your ears off if you call her Angela."

"Why?"

"It pisses her off. It's a stupid name."

"Angela means angel."

"Angel of Death maybe."

A grim way to look at yourself. "What does she look like?"

"Like me."

Rachel reflected on Old Girl's long dreads, now collected in a fountain spray of stalks, like a clump of cattails on the top of her head.

"I haven't seen anybody else with dreads here. Who's she rooming with?"

Old Girl yawned as if bored. "You."

Margaret called out, "You're up, Oldster," and 0ld Girl obediently threw back all dozen or so pills in a swallow, taking the little glass of water held out to her. Then, like a chick waiting to be fed by the Mama Bird, Old Girl opened her mouth and let Margaret swab under her tongue, between cheek and gums. She leaned back to let Margaret peer, like a spelunker, into the cave of her mouth.

"How's it going with Abilify?" Margaret asked. "It's week three."

Old Girl raised a shoulder to her ear, like a hunchback, and dragged one leg toward the door. "I'm cured! Can't you tell?"

Rachel was taking Abilify too and she wanted to say Give it time --she remembered how jangly and suicidal she felt the first six weeks until she got used to it. But Old Girl was already waggling her fingers good-bye, Tweety-Bird style.

Rachel called after her, "That Angela girl could be wrong. It could mean Avenging Angel."

"As long as it's not Angela," Old Girl said, "your ears are safe."

**Quiet Hour**

Old Girl wanted a razor in the worst way. If she had a razor, it would only take a second.

Rachel, across the room from Old Girl, shuffled through a make-up bag. "Damn. I forgot my toenail clippers. Can I borrow yours?"

Old Girl snorted. "They took those away from me when I got here."

"How do you clip your nails?"

"I don't. They just grow under my feet. They're so long now, I don't need shoes."

Rachel actually laughed at the joke. "If I'd known they'd give me a comedian for a roommate, I wouldn't have made such a stink about coming here."

Old Girl felt an unfamiliar tug of friendship but dismissed it as something she couldn't afford. Too bad she wasn't going to be around to tell all her suicide jokes. Not that many people appreciated them.

"Yippee! I didn't forget!" Rachel waved her clippers.

Now it was Old Girl's turn to be amazed. "Didn't they go through your stuff when you got here? That's contraband."

"Toenail cutters?"

"You don't cut your nails in the quick? Like every other girl here?"

Rachel shrugged. "Guess I'm just not that creative. Not like you."

"Me?"

"You're always saying something clever. What else would you call it?"

Truthful was the word that flashed through Old Girl's brain. Truthful. Not clever. Not funny. "You must have pretty low standards."

Old Girl was sorry when she saw Rachel's wince. For the millionth time, she regretted her ability to poke a soft spot.

Leia passed by with a shit-eating grin. She'd been hogging the bathroom, as usual. "Lights out in three minutes," she said, grinning like the cat that ate the canary and the coke stash too.

"Bitch" Both girls spoke at once. Then laughed at the moment of communion.

On the way to the shower, Old Girl had her flash of inspiration. Cutting nails wasn't the only thing clippers were good for. "Mind if I borrow those clippers?"

Rachel hesitated.

"I don't have HIV."

"It's not that. It's ..." She leaned against the sink, clenching her fingers like she was trying to grasp something elusive. "You shouldn't hurt yourself."

"I don't know you well enough to off myself in front of you."

Rachel handed over the clippers without a word and went about her face washing routine. It looked like it required a rocket science degree to get through all the steps, unlike Old Girl's splash-and-dash.

When Rachel finally toweled off her face, Old Girl made a show of holding up the clippers so Rachel could see her drop them back in her make-up bag. "See. No harm done."

It wasn't till Rachel walked by the Baby Changing Station that she finally noticed Old Girl's handiwork. Old Girl had scraped the "c" off the type so it read, "Baby Hanging Station."

Thank God I got a roommate with a sense of humor, Rachel thought. This place would be hell with someone who was really depressed.

**Lights Out**

By 10 p.m., Old Girl had cleaned up her side of the room. Liberated more hangers for Rachel who didn't have enough. If there was an exit survey, Old Girl would have written Buy some more hangers under suggestions for improvement. Fire the cook would be on the list.

To write a note or not? The problem was she couldn't think of anything to say. God knows, her aunt and uncle, both decent, hard-working Kansans, had tried everything on her behalf. SSRIs, psychotherapy, cognitive behavior drills, prep school, church groups (she liked the cookies), once, in desperation, they took her to a New Age regression quack who wrapped her in a blanket and rolled her up like he was going to ship her back to Iran: all in the spirit of making her "better." Old Girl knew in her heart that there was no better and why make her aunt and uncle pay when worse was what she'd come to accept? She doubted whether \'You did your best" would bring solace to two nice people who, but for fate and early Alzheimer's, would still be taking two vacations a year instead of scraping and scrimping to pay for Old Girl's treatment. Her parents' insurance policy was reasonable but after three years of treatment, it didn't take a math wizard to figure the money was running out.

Rachel asked from across the room. "Are you working on a paper?"

"Letter. "

"Me, too." A pause. "It's hard to think of anything to say."

You have no idea. "Pretty grim here, your first week?" Old Girl was used to the revolving door of roommates. At least Rachel was quiet, unlike motor mouth Trina who was bi-polar and OCD and who knew what else. Rachel hadn't said much since they'd deposited her stuff on the unused bed. That was better than fine with old Girl because she was busy cutting off all the strings of connection that tethered her to Inner Horizons. She had no intention of adding one.

Rachel was saying something about knowing that Old Girl's writing wasn't going well. "You keep sighing." Old Girl didn't know she'd even made a noise. That was the problem with roommates; they were always watching you in order to rat on you during Process Group. Old Girl has a stash of pills hidden in the closet. That had cost her a trip to Stabilization. "You can only say 'it snowed' so many times," she said.

Rachel laughed unexpectedly. "I just wrote," It snowed today." Then she added, "I guess it sounds better than 'I had an epileptic fit today.'"

"You could say 'I had an epileptic fit and it snowed today.'"

"See, you are smart."

"Am not!"

"I've been thinking about what you said in Process Group."

Old Girl couldn't remember saying anything in Process; her survival strategy, generally, was to hunker down in silence while emotional shit storms flew around the house like shrapnel.

"What'd I say?"

"Leia was talking about how sex was just a release for her. You said sex without caring is just a sandwich with no meat."

Did she say that? Old Girl had absolutely no recollection of the discussion. Of course, Leia always brought the conversation around to sex, that's what made her so boring. Had Old Girl meant it? She knew at some point that running would involve getting paid to have sex; how else would she save up enough money to live on? A McDonald's job wasn't going to pay for tuition or books. She wasn't planning to make prostitution a habit; she\'d just do it until she could save enough for rent. Then she could get by with stripping. She didn't have big boobs but she had a nice ass, if the boys here were any judges.

Beyond slipping out the front door after midnight bed check, her run plan was pretty free form.

She'd saved up four Benadryl from a bee sting and the pills were ready to dissolve in the Night Mentor's cocoa. With any luck, Charlene would be out like a light by two, at the latest, three. In Old Girl's coat pocket was a hundred dollars she'd managed to save by working the underground economy of Healing House where everything was for sale. Thank you, James, for all the \$5 treadmill payments she'd extorted out of him. All that fitness really did improve running.

She thought Rachel had gone to sleep so she was startled when she asked, "Did I look horrible when I seized?"

Old Girl turned her chair around, in order to face Rachel lying curled on one side with her covers pulled up to her chin. "Like a cod." She paused. "No, more like a large-mouthed bass."

Rachel's bell-like laugh proved to Old Girl once again, that whenever she told the truth, it was generally the right thing to say.

Out in the hallway, Charlene's corduroys could be heard wearing themselves out between her thighs. Chuh-wucka. Chuh-wucka. Charlene, whose mentorship seemed to include everybody but herself, huffed down the hall, telling everybody it was time to hit the hay.

"I'm just going to take a last pee," 0ld Girl called to Charlene. She closed the bathroom door from the outside, making sure Charlene didn't catch her exiting the hall. Charlene's cocoa was in the living room next to a Self Magazine open to a makeover page. Oh, Charlene, it's going to take more than a haircut and a new pair of clothes to cover up a hundred pounds of baby weight. The melting cap of whipped cream on Charlene's cocoa looked unbearably sad. Old Girl wished she'd been nicer to her, but it was too late now, she thought, as she took care to pour the Benadryl crumbs around the periphery of the weeping cream.

At 2 a.m., the beeping of her watch alarm (she'd put it next to her pillow to avoid waking Rachel) sucked Old Girl out of sleep. She was so far under that she didn't want to come up. She considered going the next night but dismissed the idea because she was out of Benadryl.

Charlene snored on the couch, chest rising and falling. Old Girl hoped she wouldn't get fired but there was no help for it. We're all on our own, she told the diamond splash of stars above the driveway. The road away from Healing House was blue-bright with snow. A few snowflakes drifted, as if the stars were shedding light. Old Girl (soon to be New Girl) zipped up as she walked, her boots creaking. The temperature had dropped. She had been in Idaho so long, she realized, she was beginning to speak snow. Like Charlene's stupid melting cream, the thought made her want to cry.

Her plan was to walk two miles to Highway 95 and get picked up by somebody heading south. At I-90, she'd hitch to Seattle, hopefully with a trucker. If she got lucky, maybe she could sleep in the cab unless the driver wanted company. She had a pile of country western CDs in her backpack to offer up like trucker candy. George Straight. Travis Tritt.. A blue grass band named Mighty Squirrel. Only in Idaho. Better than sex, she planned to say. She hoped she got a trucker who thought so.

She walked for what seemed like a long time. She was near the bottom of a slope (she hadn't realized the road was hilly from a car) when she heard a distant rumble behind her. Her first instinct was to get off the road and stand unseen among the hemlock trees that reached long fingered branches to the stars. She was thinking about the moose at Two Mouth Lake. Not the way it struggled and fought to save itself. That was too painful to remember. Old Girl was seeing the moment the moose had surrendered. The calm that stole over its dark eyes. The way the sun fought its way through the clouds and flamed the antler points with its rays. She imagined the moose sinking down through a column of blue to the darkness. There would be no struggle. No kicking hooves. Just a calm peaceful descent with its massive head and shoulders held regally toward the thinning light.

It would be breathtaking, floating legs and a radiant, glacial-blue antler crown. In case you ever drown yourself in a lake, you could sink down in the glacial blue depths and see what was floating with you. A wedding ring. A child's plastic boot. The sunlit crown of the suspended glacial blue beast, like the jewels of the floating realm.

Engine noise thrummed closer. In the depression in the roadway, she realized, at the bottom of the hill, it would be difficult to see a dark object on the ground until it was too late. A realization she felt like she'd been groping towards her entire life. She would think more about the run details tomorrow. Maybe plan out the route better. Take a look at a map in the library. For the moment, she'd just lie down where the moonlight didn't reach and stretch out. She scuttled onto the roadway on all fours, hoping whoever was in the car wasn't riding the brake. Lying on her side, she laid her cheek down and let the ice crystals cut into her skin. She faced the high beams and waited for the waters to close over her head.

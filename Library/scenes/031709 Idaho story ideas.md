031709 Idaho story ideas

Mirror story with therapist and Rachel

I could write & story from the P OV of a therapist -- someone who has their own problems (family, kid, illicit affair, money troubles) of their own. A story where the troubles of the adolescent mirror the problems of the therapist. Say Darlene who is Rachel or Leia's therapist. Rachel could follow the trajectory of honeymoon and perfectionism while the therapist is revisiting her own perfectionism that turns into acting out at 44?

James and Rachel

A story about James & Rachel's tentative relationship, a friendship that leads to love. Rachel watches James pursued by Leia and asks one day, "Why do you let her abuse you that way?" "Abuse me? It's about sex," he says. "It's about pulling your chain," she replies. "Leia doesn't give a shit about you. Aren't you worth more than a blow job? " I'm worth less than a blow job, he thinks.

The therapist mirror story could be about James and Claire, his therapist, and James' relationships with Leia and Rachel could be intermixed.

Now that I've written about my fears, the suicide of Old Girl, I want to write a story of the obverse: someone who goes from fuck-up to maturity. A growth story: slow steps forward with some regressions. A hopeful story in Udahoe.

Wilderness

There's a story about James going from a drunken stupor to the hinterlands of Utah or Montana. MT would be easier because I know the geography better, unless it's set somewhere near St, George. I'd have to do more research. Maybe James\' wilderness experience comes in as back story in the therapist James mirror story.

What happens. The story starts with a family therapy call that ends in a fight. James is glossing over his behavior in an impact letter. He talks about stealing or crashing his car, not about emptying an account for the mother-of-all parties, then crashes into a girl's car and leaves her bleeding & concussed by the side of the road, too drunk to remember what happened. So this story wouldn't be about the therapist /perfection theme. That would be d different story.

My story starts when James admits in an impact letter read to his parents the behaviors that got him sent to Wilderness camp and Inner Horizons **and then** his dad pokes under the glossed over story of the car crash and James goes ballistic with shame and anger and the call has to be terminated **and then** James runs into Rachel exiting the girl's bathroom after an encounter with Leia that Rachel has overheard on the NIC campus and Rachel asks him why he puts up with Leia's abuse **and then** Leia gets called out in Process for having sex with one of the gay girls which amazes James and then, before he can react, two or three of the boys all have shit fits about Leia's indiscriminate sex ( James thought: When does she have time for all the sex? How many broom closets and supply rooms and stinky men's heads has Leia lurked in, waiting to jump anything that walks?) but instead of getting mad at her or cutting her off, James grows a little when he sees her small, child-like body, pigeon toed in misery, tears dirtying her pointed face and she says, "I can't help it. It's the only time I feel complete" and then James is asked to see her with compassion and forgiveness and then Rachel and James work together: they paint the tool shed or a room as a consequence of behavior on the hike to the lake and then it feels nice working with her, she; as tall as he is, a good painter (James, for all his failings, is a strong worker, a perfection nut about his end product which is just like Rachel) and then the week rolls around and it's almost time for another therapy call but James is still mad at as Dad and then he initiates contact with Leia and right in front of his peers, holds hands with her for comfort, not for sex.

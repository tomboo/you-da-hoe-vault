**PLEASE NOTE: THIS QUERY WAS FOR THE FIRST BOOK I SUBMITTED TO AGENTS. THE LETTER WAS EFFECTIVE IN THAT MOST AGENTS WHO READ THE LETTER ASKED TO SEE THE BOOK, BUT THE BOOK WAS LESS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WANTED TO REPRESENT ME AFTER THEY READ IT. THE BOOK REMAINS UNPUBLISHED.**

Dear Mr. Silverberg,

Tina Pohlman strongly recommended that I contact you regarding my debut novel, *Alistair Wright*, which won the 2006 David Guterson Award. After reading *Alistair*, David Guterson wrote: \"As we all know, these are tough times in publishing. Fortunately, there\'s always room at the top---and that\'s where Peter Mountford belongs.\"

 

From your representation of Robert Marshall and Shelley Jackson, it\'s clear that you have a talent for selling work that\'s complicated, ambitious, and entertaining, and I think you\'d be an ideal agent to represent *Alistair Wright*.

 

The novel tells of the eponymous Scottish artist who\'s quite successful---\"solidly second tier,\" as he describes it---in the New York art world, but was recently diagnosed, at age 38, as HIV-positive. The book takes place over two years while Alistair is in Ecuador working on a series of portraits of his 21 ex-lovers. The most prominent of these, Morgan, was Alistair\'s greatest love, and the one who infected him.

 

Isolated by his foreignness, wealth, and obsession with his project, Alistair struggles to form connections in Ecuador as the country is ravaged by political and economic crises. Meanwhile, he must come to terms with the blunt certitude of his mortality and what he considers the perverse joke of life, \"that the greatest moments are always receding into the fog of unrecoverable time.\" It\'s this terror of the future and obsession with the past that drives the book, literally, backwards: The chapters proceed in reverse chronological order.

 

David Shields wrote: \"\[Alistair Wright\] is a powerful investigation of the rage toward order, toward innocence, toward purity, toward tabula rasa, and the life-giving, death-dealing nature of this rage. It\'s also, page by page, enormously engaging, lucid, readable, intelligent, and wry. In twenty years as a teacher of creative writing, I\'ve encountered only a handful of MFA theses that deserve to be published; Peter\'s is definitely one.\"

 

In addition to winning the Guterson award, I have been selected as one of the fifteen writers whose work will appear in *Best New American Voices 2008* (Harcourt). I was also one of two finalists for the 2006 *Florida Review* Editor\'s Prize. In 2005, I won both the Mary Rouvelas Prize and the Richard Blessing Award.

 

After earning a degree in International Affairs from Pitzer College in 1999, I worked as an adjunct scholar for a think tank, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution. Since leaving them in 2001, I have devoted my attention to writing fiction, and completed my MFA at the University of Washington last year. I have lived in  Ecuador , Sri Lanka , France , Scotland , and Mexico , but I now reside in Seattle , where I\'m at work on a second novel, *Jupiter\'s Range*, which is set in Chiapas , Mexico .

 

*Alistair Wright* is about 70,000 words, and is currently under consideration with Alane Mason at W. W. Norton, but if goes forward with her I\'ll still want your representation. May I send you a copy of the complete manuscript?

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

 

Sincerely,

Peter Mountford

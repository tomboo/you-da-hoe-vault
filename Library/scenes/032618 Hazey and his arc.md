032618 Hazey\'s Arc & Recertification

Hazey had handed her his credit card. Margaret, who was assiduously honest, couldn\'t resist the call of a stack of mini-cupcakes in a see-through jumbo-sized bin and perched them in the child-seat on top of her puyrse. Who gave a shit about gretchen\'s prohibitons against empty calories? When was the last time the kids got a treat, even if mini-cupcakes weren\'t on the shopping list. A two-fer, she thought. One of them and one for Dr. Hazey. Hell, a three-fer, she corrected herself. She popped the top of the bin and shoved one of the mini-cupcakes into her mouth whole.

Hazey goes from nominally in charge to completely beholden to his employee. He founds the business; he gives it life\--a specious fucked up kind of chaos\--but the more fucked up the business got, the more power people like Margaret took on. By the end of the certification debacle, Hazey was looking for someone to rescue him and tell him what to do.

As she shopped, Margaret thought of Hazey and in her mind\'s eye, she saw him like a regressive toddler, one who backslid and misbehaved and had to be put in time out. He was always saying he was the boss and that he resented the staff when they told him what to do but secretly, she knew the man was relieved to be relieved of the burden for thinking for himself. \"He looked at her shopping list like it contained the answer to his problems and he looked relieved when she walked away with his credit card.

Margeret handed him a list of suggestions, which were thinly veiled as requests when in fact they were demands and ultimatums. Most of them made sense\--why hadn\'t Hazey thought of moving Gretchen out of her poisonous cookery into a paper pushing job, bowing to the years of bitter complaints from both the kids and the parents. Common sense, that\'s what Margaret owned in spades, while he of the seven higher level academic degrees had none of it.

Resentment\--a blast of righteous indivination, passed through him but he couldn\'t make it stick. \"Who is she to tell me what to do\" was replaced by a spring blizzard melted by a zephyr or green restful calm, \"Oh thank God, Somebody else knows what to do.\"

Hazey wants the Certification Review Board to pass him with flying colors so that he can enlarge the Program to include a larger census and build a new Adolescents facility to replace the rabbit\'s warren of duplexes and bungalow houses spread around Coeur D\'Alene.

He\'d started the program as a YA program but he\'d realized over the years that young adults were way more trouble than Adolescents who had fewer hormones and hadn\'t had time to develop full blow psychosis. If truth were known, Adolescents also had more plasticity of diagnosis before their malleable brains hardened into the Borderline or Bipolar or Body Duysmorphic ruts.

The Certification Review Board was appalled to ssee on of Hazey\'s paid staff stalking around the side of Healing House with a rifle. When \<argaret blasted the feeding raccoons with a neon paintball cartridge, they felt like they\'d entered an alternate universe where the rules were up-ended or suspended.

A young adult boy died from an overdose, which Hazey understands is enough to sink the review beyond a \"no\" to a \"Hell no, are you fucking kidding us?\"\
But for once, Hazey hired the right kind of shark lawyer and paid the big bucks and Mr. Glib and Facile made an air tight case for the death of Chase as self-inflicted and not on Dr. Hazey\'s watch. Because Chase\'s adult escorports failed to divest the boy from enough coaine to stop his heart and all the raccoon\'s hearts, too, Dr. Hazey got off with a wrist slap.

Hazey understand that he had dodged a bullet; that what the Certification Board witnessed was just as much his fault as not, but he was not about to challenge the claims of Herschel WrightLaw the Third, his layer, who got him off with a laughable six-month extension of his review.

The lawyer, a smart, rapacious and absolutely ethic-less pitbull, got him off. It was the escorts, those Christ-spouting, ski-coated born-agains who were guilty of not divesting Chase of enough cocaine to stop his heart plus their own plus all the raccoons who came to feed on the garbage that day.

Hazey was smart enough to realize that he was lucky to pay through the nose for the service. He wrote the big check with scarecely a pang and felt laughably lucky to receive a slap on the wrist for \"appearance of poor judgement and laxity of rules\" which was code for a paintball gun on the premises of a mental health facility with a surfeit of unstable and thrill-seeking nuts. Hazey got around the process with a well-placed donation to the insurance commissioner\'s campaign and a painfully larger check to the shark lawyer for services rendered.

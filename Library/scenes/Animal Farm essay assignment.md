Animal Farm essay assignment

In many ways, [**Animal Farm**](http://www.articlemyriad.com/summary-animal-farm-orwell/) is a complete allegorical / fable --like retelling of the founding of the Soviet Union, complete with a rebellion and eventual installation of a dictator. Like the ideological battle that was raged in Russia between the classes, the one that is played out in this novel have many of the same themes, including an initial push to strengthen the working class, a strong beginning movement of nationalism and unity, a series of successful efforts to topple the ruling authority (Mr. Jones), all followed by a complete totalitarian takeover by a dictator who is a hypocrite and goes back on many of the promises he made at the height of the revolutionary action.

For an essay on this subject, it would be useful to spend a good two paragraphs detailing the events of the Russian Revolution and subsequent Communist rule before looking at how the history and the novel are alike. The thesis statement would be as simple as stating that there are many parallels between the Russian Revolution and ensuing Communist takeover and the events in George Orwell's novel Animal Farm.

**George Orwell wrote Animal Farm as an allegorical retelling of the founding of the Soviet Union in 1907. Pick a current event and make a case for how a situation in the news such a Myanmar's persecution of the Rohingas or the Syrian refugee crisis could be told allegorically. Extra credit for more than 10 allegorical parallels.**

041417 Rachel backstory pre HH arrival

Old Girl got a glimpse of the new girl when she arrived but then she was gone so the story was that she had somehow been able to take one look and turn tail and run. Later, she heard through the grapevine that she\'d been spotted at Stable by Etsy who had a permanent bed there from all the shit she pulled but after that, Old Girl forgot about her.

It was James who said he had a class with her at NICC and she wasn\'t sick in the parlance of Healing House which translated to psychotic or screaming or zoned out on thorazine or the cocktail of \"Let\'s calm down, shall we\" drugs they liked to use if you were acting out.

All this was pretty weird. Nobody got to take classes at NICC until they spent at least three months\--sometimes six months, for the hard cases\--in Intensive which was IH-speak for an ankle bracelet and barred from walking around the block unaccompanied by less than two Day Duties.

Old Girl, despite her desire not to get involved, was curious about how all the weirdness with Rachel went down. Rachel was neatly folding sweaters into perfectly cornered squares so she asked, \"What\'s the deal. How come you were at Stable so long?\"

Rachel shook out a silk blouse and wrinkled her eyebrows. \"Hey, I\'m out of hangers. Mind if I borrow a couple of yours?\"

Old Girl waved her permission. Her own side of the closet was beginning to look like a ghost town while Rachel\'s capacious suit case kept disgorging an endless flow of perfectly color-coordinated outfits that were packed in units and squeezed flat in airless plastic bags.

Rachel rolled her eyes when she saw Old Girl looking at the organization of the suitcase. \"Mom\'s work. She\'s a lunatic.\"

\"Or she doesn\'t have enough to do,\" Old Girl said. \"She packed for you?\"

\"They didn\'t want me to miss any more classes after this.\" Rachel raised the wrist with the shorthand of the raw jagged scar. \"They sent me directly to Idaho when I got out of the hospital. Mom had to pack for me.\"

Old Girl nodded noncommittally. There was a whole story there that you didn\'t have to be a genius to surmise. \"Most people don\'t get to take classes at NICC until they get through Intensive. It usually takes three months. Except in my case, it took six.\"

Rachel raised an eyebrow. \"Mom and Dad wouldn\'t agree to treatment at Inner Horizons unless Dr. Hazey agreed to let me get restarted in school.\" She turned away from the organized airless bags saying, \"Mom\'s got a plan for everything. She had one for me and I\'ve already blown it.\"

\"What kind of plan?\"

\"You know. What college I\'m supposed to attend. When I\'m supposed to graduate. Where I\'m supposed to go to grad school and get married.\"

\"Does she have a husband in mind for you? She\'s a hell of a planner if she does.\"

\"No, but she\'d like to.\"

This is the moment that Old Girl understood in a visceral way the concept of objective correlatives. She had been taught about them in one of her favorite English classes. If she remembered rightly, objective correlatives came up when they were reading The Great Gatsby and the teacher, Professor Madsen, was trying to get a bunch of junior high schooler to understand that the greeg light of East Egg was a symbol o Gatsby\'s unreachable dreams. Maybe one of twenty-five students got the idea from the Professor\'s lecture so Old Girl was surprised that the green beacon still gleamed through the dark times she had experienced after the class.

For the first time, Old Girl understood in a visceral way how a thing could stand for an emotional state, like a person\'s hopes or dreams. Someback in ancient history before the accident that wiped out her family, Old Girl had been taught about objective correlatives by a young student tteacher who was trying to teach The Great Gatsby to a disinterested group of junior high school students when they were ruled by hormones and raging acne. \"The green light was the symbol of Jay Gatsby\'s unattainable dreams,\" she remembered Mr. Marsden, with the world\'s biggest Adam\'s apple, saying. \"Yes, but it\'s just a light,\" somebody protested. \"A light and a beacon. It can be both things at once. A light and a dream that will never come closer.\"

The suitcase was still disgorging its organized and airless bags of pressed clothing. Every bag contained an entire life for Rachel that was sadly absent the girl herself. Old Girl had no idea what Rachel\'s crazy mother looked like but she was pretty sure she\'d recognize her by the violet sachet smell that was cloying the room.

Rachel interrupted Old Girl\'s thoughts. \"I was in quarantine at Stable but I wasn\'t sick.\"

\"What did you have? Cooties?\"

Rachel smiled. \"I haven\'t been vaccinated. Somebody at Healing House had measles. Mom was terrified I\'d get it.\"

Old Girl racked her brain. She couldn\'t think of anybody who had had the measles. Wait. Didn\'t one of the Night Dutties\' kids get the mumps? She remember that Charleen, a regular at their late night card games, had been MIA for a few days when one of her kid\'s was sick.

\"Weird, isn\'t it.\" Rachel said.

\"What?\"

\"Mom and Dad are convinced that immunizations cause autism. That\'s why they wouldn\'t let me have any. They were furious when they read my adoption records a month after I arrived and realized I\'d already been given all the baby shots. I think they would have sent me back if I hadn\'t already been there. At least that\'s the joke they tell.\"

\"You\'re kidding.\"

\"Nope. They're part of the FMFGC. The Free Marin from Immunization Governmental Control, Fonding members.\"

\"That\'s pretty wacky.\"

\"Try growing up with them.\"

\"What do they do?\"

\"Dad has a naturopathic degree but he mostly plays tennis. Mom\'s into ayurvedic education.\"

\"And they make money at this?\"

\"No, no. Or not at lot, anyway. Mom\'s from old money. Her grandfather was a chemist. He patented a pesticide still in use today.\"

That was a fact that Old Girl had to store for future consumption. The journey from ayurvedic education to pesticides was such a strange one, it wouldn\'t be one she could take for a lot of years.

\"So wait. Let me get this straight. Your parents sent you to Idaho to take classes?:

\"No, silly. I\'m here for the same reason you are.\"

I doubt that, Old Girl thought to herself. You don\'t want to die every minute, do you. \"You\'ve got...\" How to say it politely? \"... psychiatric problems?\"

Rachel held both wrists up this time. \"Why do you think they made us room mates? I\'m your partner in crime.\"

OMG. No! It couldn\'t be. That fucker Hazey! Did he plan it this way? What did he think? That Old Girl and Rachel were going to bond over stories about attempted hanging?

Did Hazey think that she and Rachel were going to bond over self-asphyxiation stories?

Did Hazey think she was going to bond with her new room mate over the best way to tie a hangman\'s knot?

**PLEASE NOTE: THIS QUERY WAS FOR THE SECOND BOOK I SUBMITTED TO AGENTS. THIS TIME THE QUERY WORKED AND SO DID THE BOOK\...I SIGNED WITH A GREAT AGENT WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF SENDING OUT THE LETTER.**

Dear AGENT,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ recommended that I contact you about a novel I recently finished writing. *A Young Man's Guide to Late Capitalism* is about an equities analyst at a hedge fund who commits securities fraud. Improbable as it may sound, I began writing the book a year before the current financial crisis got underway.

The book is partially inspired by my experiences working in Latin America as an adjunct scholar for a DC-based think tank. A short story I wrote, which was also based on those experiences, was selected by Junot Diaz as one of the winners of the 2007 *Boston Review* prize.

*A Young Man's Guide to Late Capitalism* tells of 27-year-old Gabriel Francisco de Boya who, having just been hired as by a notoriously rapacious hedge fund, The Fallon Group, embarks on his first assignment in the field. Set entirely in La Paz at the end of 2005, the book charts Gabriel\'s attempts to generate profit from the election of Bolivia's current president, Evo Morales. In the face of pressing financial incentives, he\'s forced to cope with the ethical implications of the work he\'s doing; he maintains a complex and growing series of lies, including ones he tells to Morales\'s press liaison, Lenka Villabroles, with whom he has fallen in love.   

 

Upon reading the book, David Shields wrote, \" *A Young Man's Guide to Late Capitalism* is, quite simply, one of the most compelling and thought-provoking novels I\'ve read in years. It\'s extraordinarily vivid, populated by characters whose fates I cared about desperately, beautifully written, timely beyond measure, but above all it conveys---with impressive precision and nuance---how we are vectors on the grid of global capital; how difficult it is to even attempt to be an authentic, let alone admirable, human being when we are, first and last, cash flow.\"

  

In the last two years, my stories have been published in *Best New American Voices 2008*, *Conjunctions*, *Boston Review*, and *Michigan Quarterly Review.* A 2008-09 writer-in-residence at Seattle Arts & Lectures, I also won the 2008 LeSage-Fullilove Fellowship at Yaddo, awarded \"to support an emerging writer of exceptional talent or promise\" (other recent winners include Andrew Sean Greer and Fiona Maazel). Salman Rushdie selected one of my stories as one of the "100 Other Distinguished Short Stories of 2007" in *Best American Short Stories 2008*.

 

I\'ve also completed the first half of another novel, which is set in the same fictional time and space as *A Young Man's Guide to Late Capitalism*. Though distinct, the two books have overlapping characters and events. *Kamikaze* is about a middle-aged vice-president at the World Bank who deliberately destroys his career over a seemingly insignificant argument with a co-worker about Bolivia. 

 

*A Young Man's Guide to Late Capitalism* is 100,000 words long.  May I send you a copy of the manuscript?

 

All the best,

 

Peter Mountford

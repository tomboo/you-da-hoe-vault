01162025 How Hazey helps OG Reassemble

Does the weird woo-woo EMDR process, which is basically watching some skunk-smelling, wed0-addicted old guy move his finger from side to side, instill in OG a kind of hope? She hoped not because then it would be hard to defend against the claim that she really was a nut.

OG tells herself she doesn't want to get involved with yet another sad sack.

There was something about those picture of OG's intact family that she reluctantly removed from her backpack and set up in their fragile little grouping of smithereens. She only reluctantly brought them out of hiding because if she didn't, it would look exactly like what she was doing: she was moving on.

She magnanimously offered to free up hangers for Rachel to use because she wouldn't need them to hold up her scarecrow costumes that were as black as the ravens they were meant to scare off.

Rachel looks at the picture of OG holding Gabe as a baby for a long time. OG will only understand that assessing gaze later when she realized the new girl was thinking of her own lost baby. To her, OG's family looks like the happy family she's never going to get because she closed her eyes and the baby that was lying on her chest was snatched away.

One moment of shared grace between them. An instant of connection that feels like a benediction to keep her warm when OZG quietly shuts the side door out of the kitchen and embarks beyond the gold porch light into the cold blue and lavender shadows of a moonlit night.

Rachel is busy unpacking as OG is busy trying to hide the fact that she is packing up without letting on to her new roommate that she's running.

Margaret is the only person at Inner Horizons she'd really miss. She'll miss her baked goods --- a lifelong jones for cinnamon rolls with follow her through her life --- always equating their warmth with Margaret's warmth that she blames on her constant red flushes and hot flashes.

Rachel is sad, longing for the baby she tells OG about when OG asked her about the ultrasound wave of a strip, possibly a grub, that seems to be sucking its thumb.

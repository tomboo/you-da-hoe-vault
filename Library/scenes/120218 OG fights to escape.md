120218 OG fights to escape

They were all oblivious to her distress. They clapped her on the back. Hugged and har-harred and welcomed her back to life. So smug about their part in keeping her tethered to a life she didn't want.

OG found herself fighting to get loose. Reza, on one side of her, clapped his arms around her neck like a leach with a sucking mouth. Rachel, her new roommate, was leaning into her shoulder. She managed to loosen Reza's clinging arms but Rachel was suddenly listing towards her in the strangest way. When the girl's knees buckled and her whole weight sagged against her, OG automatically threw out her arms to catch her and the girl's weight knocked both of them to the floor.

OG hit first with Rachel partially on top of her. OG struggled to get out from under hercloying weight and was shocked to feel the girl slapping and kicking at her. She scrabbled backwards to get away from her and was astonished to see the girl shaking and twitching and jerking like an alien.

It took James shout in her ear to make her understand. "She's having a fit!" he cried. "Help her."

OG banged her already sore back on the edge of the coffee table. Everything in her brain screamed "Get me out of here!" while an alien seemed to take over the black girl's body and danced her to its horrible tune.

The group's closeness was always cloying. But now the hug felt claustrophobic and airless, like that moment of blackness when she was weighted down by the snow.

Rachel's fit replaced OG's rescue as the thing in need of processing but there was no one to guide them through it. In five seconds, the troops went from general hilarity to appalled quiet. It was one thing to be a part of a live saving mission and completely another to witness a body slipping its bounds.

"is she dying?" Lydia whispered, as if afraid to speak the idea out loud.

"She's having a fit," James snapped.

So the next thing to dying is how OG took James's retort.

062716 Lydia Goes to Sleep

The experience of being terrorized and beaten and thinking Jed was going to kill her had made her feel smaller and smaller as the night wore on. By the end, when Jed was higher than a helium balloon and Frankie O was trying to push his coat on her for the walk down to the highway from Wolf Ridge, she felt like she'd gotten so small, the coat would swallow her. Once they ground down the hill in a smog of exhaust and sulfurous yellow headlights, she dropped the brown jacket in the snow like a body she was leaving behind.

Something was wrong with her ear. She caught snatches of conversation. Frank: ...taking a piss. Jed: ... little piss ant.

Lydia curled on the ground where Jed had finally left off kicking her. It felt good to just lie still. She was conscious of a bone deep tiredness like she'd run a marathon with everything she had and was now emptied out and hollow. Even the cold creeping into her bones felt good because it was putting out everything that was on fire inside her.

Then Frankie O was jerking at her arm and shaking her awake. She thought for a second that he was going to start in on her again. "Get up!" he was saying. "You can't go to sleep."

She found herself yanked upright, legs wobbling underneath her. He steadied her by holding onto her arm till she somehow balanced herself on feet that felt like wooden blocks. His narrow, ferrety face looked pale and stark in the silvery snow light. "Put this on." He was unzipping and shrugging out of his jacket and pushing it at her before she figured out what it wanted. The down was still warm from his body. It smelled smoky and musky and she couldn't seem to make her hands work to take it.

"No," she mumbled. "'m OK. Fine. Fine." From somewhere above herself, she saw herself thrusting the warmth of the jacket away from herself. All she wanted was to find the words that would make him go away so she could lie down and go back to sleep.

He held onto her by one arm and roughly manhandled her other arm into the coat like she was an unruly child. "All you gotta do is walk down hill. Coupla' miles. That's all, just keep walking."

She nodded as if agreeing to the words "keep walking" though by then she was parroting them because they had no more meaning than philosophy or differential equations. She shuffled obediently away from him with the jacket unzipped, one sleeve hanging off her shoulder.

"Not that way!" He caught her arm and aimed her toward the road that led downhill. Then, with Jed yelling at him to hurry up, he knelt in front of her and pulled the sleeves down over her wrists, then zipped the zipper all the way up to her chin. He ignored the fact that she was naked from the waist down except for her socks. When Jed had dragged her out of the cab to beat her, he ripped her pants off and tossed them over the cliff. They were somewhere down there in the bushes, she thought. Good thing she still had socks. Smart Wool. For a dumb girl who couldn't think beyond sinking to her knees to rest.

"Christ," Frankie O expelled a breath of steam. He kept wiping at the dark stickiness that was flowing from her nose, saying. "You're messed up."

She had started out terrified but as the night wore on and on, she lost any feeling at all and just closed her eyes hoping for it to be over. At one point, when Jed was shaking and choking her, Frankie O got out of the truck and distracted him with a tab of Ecstasy. "I've been saving it for an emergency," he said.

Between the bouts of slapping and punching, Jed hammered into her rear entry and shoved her face sback and forth in the snow until it was rubbed raw with rocks and grit. She swallowed a mouthful of snow, wishing she could disappear like the cold that was in her mouth an instant and then inexplicably gone before she could even swallow.

He'd pulled the fake-fur lined hood up but it was so big, the hood came down over her eyes and it felt like she was walking blind.

The truck switch-backed rhythmically down the hill and she watched the yellow cone of light swaying and rocking for a long time. It looked like the truck was making a figure skating move she'd learned as a child in Detroit, a kind of swaying backward motion that died into stillness when gravity ran out.

Frankie's worried expression flitted through her mind as she swayed on her feet looking out at the dim and silvery slope which seemed to be constantly moving like a silvered surf. "Keep walking." He sounded like a parrot who didn't know what the words meant but liked to hear itself talk. The words had barely registered in Lydia and she knew for a fact that Jed hadn't heard him or he would have objected to her bleeding on the upholstery. Frankie was driving so he was probably passed out in the front seat from all his exertions.

For the most part, Frankie O had stayed out of it while Jed was cursing and whaling on her. But then again, maybe this "keep walking" was a new part of the torture Jed had planned for her. She could hear a low moan of country music now and then from the cab where Frankie smoked dope with the windows crack. The smell of warm smoke came to her once when he got out to take a piss and lob beer cans out in the darkness.

Once the Ecstasy kicked in, Jed seemed to lose his focus. He staggered around the snowy clearing like he was both drunk and stoned and whined about needing to catch his breath. Frankie made an attempt to move her to the cab then but Jed went ape shit when he saw that her blood on his new light leather upholstery. That's how she ended up on her hands and knees behind the truck bed when they drove off.

He'd thrown her pants somewhere out on the downslope in the snow along with her boots, though he left her Smart Wool socks on. Her pink underpants ended up rolled around one ankle like a festive wedding garter. She only knew this because the undies kept interfering when she took a step forward in Frankie's flopping work boots. It took her forever to decide whether to risk bending over to take them off because if she fell down, she didn't think she would be able to stand up again.

Bare assed. Swaddled in a brown down coat with a wolf-ruffed hood. Who would know her from anyone else if she met someone on the road. The thought struck her oddly funy since the white world around her was full of blue-black Ponderosas and low hillocks of snowy bushes and the occasional mushroom hump of a boulder. Nothing else.

The ruts left by the truck began filling in as she walked. She hadn't noticed when it had started snowing. They had shifted to four-wheel drive to make it up to the ridge top and early in the evening, there were a few distant pinpricks of stars. She had no conception of how much time had passed. Only that now the dull sulfurous light of a rising moon was oozing between scudding clouds. Snow flakes the size of her thumb drifted silent down. It wasn't long before her hair was covered with a furze of white. It felt like she had turned into an old person in the space of a few hours. She was walking bent over and aching in her lower back where she'd been kicked and punched repeatedly and her head both ached and felt a million sizes too big. She kept staggering like Frankenstein and had to re-correct her aim over and over so she didn't walk off the edge of the road.

After a while, it just seemed like a lot of trouble to keep going. Why bother? Why work so hard for something he didn't even want. Staying upright was hard. Lying down would be so much easier.

The ground looked inviting. Pillowy soft and covered with a growing blanket of snow that promised rest and quiet without pain.

If she stayed upright, she would continue to struggle to draw breath and fight to drag the big, slipping boots forward one more step. The idea of the bottom of the hill seemed like such a distance she couldn't even imagine it. Frankie had said it wasn't very far. "A coupla miles." Had she even gone a mile yet? What was a mile when each step was one too many?

When one of the boots slipped forward on an icy patch, she landed awkwardly with one leg forward and the other bent under her. She'd been thinking about Lorenzo. Hoping he'd taken the Judith Lieber bag to the Luxe where he would have gotten the best price for it. The idea of the white silvery sequins and the winking kitten dangling form his big freckled paw made her smile. The kitten bag would help Lorenzo as it had never helped Lydia, except for the wicked sense of satisfaction she felt the day she stole it from her mother's closet. Would he remember her longer than it took for the money he got for it to be used up. It would be nice to be remembered by someone, she was thinking, as she sank forward on her knees in child's pose and closed her eyes and let the darkness erase her.

Death Revelation

The ticking of the engine. A drip like the dripping of a faucet. The rasp dry and bright as wheat chaff of his breath.

Something feels enormous. Ever after she will remember this moment but have no idea why except that she feels she\'s in the presence of death. The only time that will come close to this feeling in her later life will be the death of a baby that is so far from conception at this point it might as well be one of the stars in the black night sky.

His grip has loosened. Before, in his fear, she felt like the man \-- grubby, dirt encrusted, smelling vaguely of hamburger grease and motor oil \-- was holding on to her as if to life itself. At some point, maybe when his breathing started to change from an even breathy rasp to deep in inhalations with long silences between \-- she realizes she is the one gripping him.

If she had all the power in the world, she\'d keep him in the cab, among the burger wrapping from old coffee cups, the ripped seat with the guts of the seat spilling out.

His eyes are closed. his color, when she got in the cab, was ruddy with life, and now his lips have whitened and he\'s a dusky blue on the tip of his nose. The black stubble of his beard looks blacker, more light resistant in contract to his whitening skin.

When the silence between the gasping scratch gets longer, she knows he\'s going. Four... five... on through six slow gasps, the silence stretches out and he jaw doesn\'t open.

This is death. It\'s not a question. She\'s never seen it but has longed for it with all her being since she was ten or eleven years old, and in the moment of recognition of the light in his flinty eyes being turned off, she reaches forward and flicks the high beams off.

She\'s never felt so alone in her life. The silver snow light seems colder. A few snow flakes sift down from the sparkled and \_\_\_\_ pine branches bent over by the crash.

Before she jumps down from the cab, she opens the glove box and takes the wallet jammed in there with a weird assortment of nuts and bolts and a bag of Tootsie Rolls. She helps herself to a handful. Then she picks the doll with the shaving brush head and the sharp swirled unicorn shell for a penis into her back pack. She wraps a sweater around its lower half, hoping the shell won\'t break. It\'s some kind of talisman of the night she\'s just spent, though she understand that with or without the man doll, she\'s unlikely to ever forget it.

Garbage Man\'s Crash Scene

Garbage Man\'s POV

His gift to Rachel, the mirror of the girl baby he left on her pillow, is lying next to him on the seat. He\'s proud of it. Proud of the sharp and poking penis that he envisions puncturing her like a spike. Proud of the eyeballs he prized from a baby doll and cleverly welded to short but flexible springs so they move and jump with the truck as it shimmies and sways on the icy ruts. He\'s particularly pleased with the shaving brush that \_\_\_\_\_ as a \_\_\_\_ of manly hair over the featureless white handle that is transmuted into a noseless face with jump eyes.

The six pack of beer he\'s been drinking is four down, only two beers left in the stranglehold of the plastic rings. He reaches into his pockets and feels for the zip ties he\'s put there to bind her ankles and writsts. Everything\'s ready. Everything neatly in place.

In his mind\'s eye, while he fumbles for the next beer, both hands off the wheel, he sets the container he\'s fixed up with its handcuffs and nylon ropes hanging on doll legs he\'s formed into hooks. He pulls on the plastic ring, trying to keep the pulling truck on the road with one knee while he pulls the beer can out of its harness.

Bright red eyes. A coyote standing in the middle of the white road, its head turned over its shoulder and looking back at him.

With his hands occupied, the knee slips from the wheel, the pull tab catches in his finger as the truck swerves \_\_\_\_ in a rut.

Before he knows what\'s happening, the truck with its left pulling steering is careening away from the curve in the road. He feels it lift off as if the old rusty vehicle has sprouted wings. Flying, he thinks with amazement, right before the solid bulk of a Ponderosa \_\_\_\_\_ to the last thing he sees.

Bright feral eyes. Red in his high beams. He doesn\'t see the dark form lying at the base of the hill right after the sharp curve because he\'s too busy wrestling the steering wheel, one hand stuck to the pull tab of the beer he\'s been opening. Dog? He has time to think. wolf? He\'s \_\_\_ as the truck lifts off and misses the sharp turn that will \_\_\_\_ him up \_\_\_\_ Man\'s Hill toward his bride. He sees a \_\_\_\_ caramel colored Ponderosa coming at him like a wall. \_\_\_ \_\_\_ \_\_\_ the steering wheel. Coyote?

From the Coyote\'s POV

Padding from the river along the familiar trail, the female coyote stops to sniff. A whisper of vole over the snow. Too far under. but never remembering. Her belly is empty and her kits are crying in the den. The urge to fee is high and she raises her nose in the breeze. An unfamiliar smell \-- she approaches the road warily. Cautious. Her nose pops above the snow. The smell is stronger. Something flower. Abnormal. Not right for the snow time and cold.

2^nd^ Coyote POV

Leaving behind the imperative cries of waking kits, the coyote pads the usual trail. First, a drink in the river. Then skirting the edge of dark trees, across an open meadow and up a hill toward the death road, usually silent of bright lights on its blaring sounds. She sniffs. A far distant vole, now hidden under the snow and safe in its subterranean nest. Her stomach rumbles, reminding her of its growing hunger, the crying of her kits a mile away by the rush and tumult of the river.

She edges through the trees and climbs the snow slope, swinging her muzzle side to side, gathering in familiar smells of cheat grass crushed in the snow piles next to the road; snow snapped boughs of pines pulled beyond their limit by its weight; the faint linger of exhaust and oil and \_\_\_\_ smells she only registers as past, not present dangers.

On the freshening breeze, smelling interesting enough to make her pause before she steps on the scraped road. Floral. A wiff of roses she half remembers from a trot down a back alley in town on a reconnaissance tour of garbage cans, always hoping for an off-kilter lid, something piled too high for the metal rims to pinch cruelly closed.

She pads into the road to investigate. Curiosity killed the coyote, she knows the warning, not the words. Wary. Ready to turn and flee, she picks her way toward a dark shape lying the roadway.

It wasn\'t there this morning on her dawn hunt. What\'s it dong there? The shape is quiet. No movement. A slight wiffle of frosted breath rises and rests a few inches above it, as if it\'s trying to cover itself with a small fog of life.

The coyote wants to come closer to the smell. Something \-- meat? cheese? \-- is in the pack and she wants it though she knows whatever is in the road might not want to give it up.

Caught by the desire to go closer and stopped by the feat of the unknown, the coyote registers the rushing lights upon her. The scream of brakes, the warm growled road that\'s rushing towards her. For one moment, she\'s frozen by the unnatural brightness of the beam. Then the light sweeps pat her and something heavy flies close to her. She springs at the instant the pine she has just stopped in front of bends backwards with a crash that tears the night.

Kim Idahoisms

Finding a Decent Chinese Restaurant. Now Basque \-- Basque restaurants we can find. Boise has the largest Basque population outside of Basqueland, or wherever the heck they come from.

Outside of work, our closest Boise friends are probably the guy at the windshield repair place (2 rock chips in my windshield so far), the guy at the feed store, and Charlie at Home Depot. They all know us by name. The lady who works in the airport restaurant knows me now too, even though I\'ve only eaten there twice. She always goes to get me parking validations even though the parking only costs 65 cents.

He talked fish with the movers who moved us in, talked fish with the locksmith who rekeyed all our locks, and for a change of pace discussed horses with our new farrier, Biaggio (who\'s from Sicily, so don\'t make him mad). Thank goodness Mark wasn\'t home when the furnace man came or I\'d still be waiting for heat.

The furnace man, for instance. He didn\'t have the right thermostat to install, so I decided to just go get one myself (we hadn\'t had heat for 3 weeks). Of course it has to control both the heat and air conditioning. So he showed me how to hook it up, then gave me his HOME phone number in case I had any questions. And today at lunch, we went to a woodworking store to look for some stuff for my dad, and were reading their \"catalog.\" The owner states in the catalog that if you\'re in town at a time outside of regular business hours, to call her at home and she\'ll come down and open up for you.

One car dealer had a readerboard proclaiming \"Free shotgun with purchase of pickup.\" The local high school has a sign warning \"No horses on lawn.\" And the tattoo parlor has one that says \"Hell yes it hurts.\"

We WARNED her about Idaho roads, but she was still surprised to find out that what look like perfectly civilized, paved roads on the map turn out to be dirt affairs with potholes that would make a 4x4 cringe. They\'ve got Manly Roads in Idaho!

Whiskey decided it was more fun to be terrified of it and go bucking and farting across the pasture. And he took a distinct dislike to the water heater we got for his water trough \-- he spent the first few days expressing his discontent by thonking his hoof against the side of the metal tank all night long, just like a convict banging a metal cup on the bars. Then when that didn\'t work he took a more direct approach \-- we found the heater lying on the ground with teeth marks in it.

Of course, we\'re having to adjust to 12-degree temperatures (soon to get colder), but now that I have my floor-length down parka I\'m prepared.

Even when it\'s cloudy, there are real clouds \-- with edges \-- and it usually clears up at least part of the day. And the sunsets and sunrises are spectacular. There\'s about a 5-minute period every evening when the hills glow this lovely shade of Dusty Rose. I\'ve even caught the horses staring at it.

And it\'s dry. You hang a towel up after taking a shower and it\'s dry again in a couple hours. Of course, the downside is there\'s no humidity to make the wrinkles fall out of things. All those clothes in my wardrobe I thought were \"wrinkle free\" suddenly aren\'t, so I\'ve had to relearn how to iron.

Mark\'s been making the rounds on horseback, hitting all the local team penning establishments. Tuesday nights you can practice penning in Eagle, Mondays/

Wednesdays/Saturdays you can practice roping in Nampa, Thursday nights it\'s penning in Nampa and Friday it\'s penning in Kuna. I think there\'s something in Caldwell too but I can\'t remember when.

We even saw a wild horse yesterday, down by the Snake River Canyon. We were driving home and it ran across the highway. We thought it had gotten away from someone \'cause it was by itself, so we parked and Mark tried to get near it on Starr, but it wanted nothing to do with either of them and took off over the hills. Then we came across some cowboys up the road and it turns out they\'d been trying to catch it too \-- it\'d been running loose around there for several weeks. And there aren\'t any farms or fences in that neck of the woods.

we did go look at the mustangs the BLM brought in for their adoption program. Some of them weren\'t too bad looking, but many of them looked like someone had beat them with an ugly stick. I think it\'s neat these mustangs live in the Owyhee Mountains not much more than an hour from here.

We did, however, find about a dozen black widow spiders hanging out in our \"barn\" (metal prefab building behind the house), so Mark went on a rampage with the RAID. Mostly we were annoyed by earwigs (early in the season) and box alder beetles (late in the season). No wonder this climate is so good for trout\--lots to eat!

I really love the peppermint they grow here in summer because it smells so good, and the black-eyed susans. They make me smile whenever I see them \'cause stick up over the sagebrush like they\'re peeking over to see what\'s on the other side.

Had a great summer\--mostly spent horseback riding through the sagebrush and black-eyed susans. Found some great spots to ride, from a very picturesque creek with big cottonwood trees, to a place in the BLM\'s wild horse sanctuary that looks like it\'s straight out of an old western, with red rock formations, deep gullies (\"draws\") and rolling hills.

I got Twister in spring, but as soon as he passed the vet check he became a gelding instead of a stud. He\'s a great horse, and he keeps getting better as he matures. The one \"bad\" thing he did (although it was more my fault than his) was to pull back on the rope when we were unloading him from the trailer, which broke my finger right at the middle joint. It\'s the middle finger on my right hand, which is good because I\'m left-handed. But it\'s also bad because it\'s my middle finger, which still sticks up fairly stiff at everybody, even after months of physical therapy plus having the doctor go in and rebreak it. (Of course this finger position can be kind of satisfying in certain client meetings when things aren\'t going well.) The doctor told me I\'d be able to tell what the weather was going to do all winter,

We also started running ads to sell Starr, Mark\'s mare, because she doesn\'t get along with our geldings. To put it politely, she\'s a flirt.

Did you know that Idaho is the only state that has a state emblem designed by a woman? I couldn\'t go a whole letter without at least one piece of trivia in. And here\'s an Idaho exclusive for ya\... there\'s a sporting goods store here that has a bait machine outside. You know, like a pop machine, only with live fishing bait in it. Worms, nightcrawlers, whatever catches your fancy. Only in Idaho\...

We added our third Idaho Rock Chip to our collection \-- this one on Mark\'s truck. It started spreading before we could do anything about it (we were on the freeway on our way to Bud\'s ranch in Oregon) so we had to replace the whole windshield. And these were all collected on the PAVED roads!

I saw another Idaho-style bumper sticker the other day. \"My kid can beat up your honor student!\" I can tell we\'re in redneck country here. I know \'cause:

1\) Mark found a duck egg in the back yard by the lilacs.

2\) We had a fox in our yard. (Did you know a fox can outrun Zeke going full out? I never would have believed it.)

and mostly:

3\) The neighbor had his shotgun out and was going to try to shoot the fox as it left our yard. (Don\'t worry \-- the fox was smarter than he was. I think he\'s from California.)

We had a robin nesting in a freesia bush in our backyard right between our bathroom and bedroom windows. The nest was only about 4 feet off the ground, and I could look right into it from either window. She laid 5 eggs, and 4 of them hatched. Every morning I\'d stick my head out the bathroom window to see what was new. Eventually three of the babies left the nest.

The last one kept getting bigger, but I just figured he was the last egg laid so he was taking longer. Both parents kept feeding him. Then one night we had a really bad windstorm. I checked on the nest and it was ok, but the next day when I went out the baby bird was hanging dead from the nest\--his mom had used some horsehair in the nest and it was tangled around his leg so he couldn\'t get loose. I felt so bad! I buried him under the freesia. Then Mark found two dead baby starlings in the water trough, and as I was walking across the yard I found 4 more dead baby birds under the Locust tree. Mark asked me if I buried those too, and I said no, I put them in the trash. He asked why and I said, \"Because I didn\'t know them personally.\" Guys just don\'t understand\...

Another one was when we were driving through Nampa, a town about 10 minutes from here. I spotted a business sign on the side of a house, \"Knitting & Welding.\" Interesting combination!

Lynne drove out in May with her two dogs. In just one week, her dogs got bit on the foot by a fire ant, acquired ticks, got burs and foxtails in their fur and generally had a rough time. Thank goodness they didn\'t find any rattlesnakes or I\'d never hear the end of it.

Richland, Oregon. Population 175. Please drive carefully.

So of course, with one cat gone (and Murphy gone to live with our petsitter), we got two new cats. We couldn't agree on which one to bring home from the Humane Society, so now Fizz and Indy have to share quarters with Harley the tortoiseshell and Abbie Normal, the psycho tabby. Mark says Harley's family tree only has one branch. She's the sweetest cat, but she falls over when you pet her and she's not very bright. And Abbie Normal is a tiny little thing who looks harmless, but if you pick her up, she's affectionate for about 30 seconds then turns into an armful of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Hence she became our first indoor-outdoor cat. (We decided it would serve the coyotes right if they tried to eat her.)

This whole area is growing, but I still see plenty of things I don't think I'd find in Seattle. Saw a yellow schoolbus converted into a pickup truck one day. (Around here, a "compact spot" means a shortbed pickup.) And when we went to get our new voter's and auto licenses, we had to go to the Gem County Courthouse where they leave the window open so the resident squirrel can come and go as he pleases.

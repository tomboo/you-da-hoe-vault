James

James wasn't there when the new girl was introduced. He'd been late for Process because his therapist, Josh, was late for his individual session so they went 15 minutes over. It wasn't like missing out on Process was a big deal. Three times a week under the microscope of your peers would make any normal person insane.

Normal. That was a joke. James was surrounded by the lame and halt at Inner Horizons, all the abnormal with parents who could pay the freight. Like James' parents: Dad, CEO of his own company, and Dr. Mom, a clinical researcher, both of whom were used to giving orders and being obeyed. Not skills James was the least bit interested in learning, which was what Josh had reminded him of today in his session.

"What the shit?" he said to Ophelia next to him on the couch, when the new girl stood up. James had been expecting her to walk out. Instead, her eyes rolled back in her head like the kewpie doll James had hung in the rearview mirror of his Corvette. She went over backward, falling towards him, and when he caught her by the shoulders, he had the unusual perspective of looking down at her upside down face into the whites of her eyes. *Exorcist time*. Her pupils were completely sucked inside her skull.

Darlene vaulted out of her chair. "Get a wooden spoon!" she yelled to Leia. "Somebody get Bruce and call 911!"

By this time, the new girl was flopping like a carp on the carpet and everybody in Process was sitting forward on the edge of their seats like they were watching Chain Saw II at the multiplex. James was torn between being thankful to the new girl for providing something new to talk about and feeling appalled at the sight of Bruce, the day manager, forcing a soup spoon between her teeth while Darlene held her by the ears.

James and Reza were instructed to hold onto her legs and the second he touched her, it felt like being attached to someone being electrocuted; James could feel something like a shock wave circling through her body, around and around. Her muscles tensed and clenched and her heels drummed a tattoo on the floor, even though James was holding one leg down with his full strength.

James knew about epilepsy. He knew about it on a rational level in his surprisingly well-read head. But this -- this laying on of hands on a person seized by electricity, as if a bolt of lighting struck out of the ether-- impressed him ten thousand times more than any Process group wisdom. After what seemed like an eternity of convulsions, the blond girl's eyes -- very gray, almost charcoal -- popped open. James had the impression the new girl was looking up him and the other faces clustered around her and wondering whether she'd died and gone to hell. Consciousness -- of what she'd done, not necessarily who they were -- spread over her ashen face like a slow motion wave of horror. *The monster is out of the closet---and it is me*, James thought.

She sat up. James, still holding onto her legs, surprised himself by squeezing her hand. The fingers were long and thin, fragile as bird bones. She squeezed automatically back, then dropped James' hand as if she'd been burned. James, embarrassed at his clumsy attempt at comfort, jumped to his feet. Her eyes met his and James had the feeling she was seeing him for the first time.

"Are you feeling better?" Darlene was asking her. The new girl was still holding the spoon she'd removed from her mouth. She looked tired and dazed. James thought he could see shame pouring out of her pores, as she inspected the carpet, avoiding all the eyes that were still watching her to do something bizarre.

Because Healing House (all the houses had lame-oh names) was ten miles outside of town, Darlene and Bruce decided to load the new girl into the Suburban and take her to the hospital; it was faster than waiting for the ambulance. They put Micah, one of the Counselors, in charge.

After that, Process Group was officially toast. Everybody basically sat around and replayed what they each were thinking when the girl went down. Alice, the anorexic-bulimic who never thought of anything but food, said, "I thought she was going to barf up breakfast."

Reza, the kid from New Jersey, said, "I thought she was going to the bathroom."

"Didn't they know she was epileptic?" Angela, the mean girl who'd been at the program the longest of any of them, was outraged. "Shouldn't they be more careful?"

Angela won't deign to speak to him, a short timer of only six weeks (an eternity, in his mind). "Careful of what? Epilepsy isn't something you can plan for." James surprised himself by standing up to 0ld Girl. Usually he avoided her rather than let her embarrass him.

Paul, the kid who never *ever* said anything, said, "She looked like the Exorcist." You mean the kid inhabited by the devil, not the priest, James wanted to say. Everybody stared at Paul like they'd heard a ghost.

"What the fuck are you looking at?" Paul demanded. "Her eyes rolled up in her *head!"*

They all laughed then and Paul went back to inspecting his favorite flower in the carpet. James wasn't sure but he suspected Paul was autistic but he'd been too busy with his own shit to find out.

Idaho Scenes

Today I\'m writing a story that requires a scene list.

Let\'s start with missing scenes in the beginning of my story. About P/P1, I want to introduce the character of the Garbageman \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ dead persons hair.

The scene needs to introduce his routine of picking up garbage in rural Idaho when he circles around Healing House and rattles the cans at 5 a.m. to wake people up until he figures out he should keep quiet if he wants to spy on the psycho kid without their knowing. On his circuit is Dr. Hazey\'s house, but that doesn\'t know her kids call Hazey Dr. Lazy or Dr. Crazy or Dr. Lazy Crazy and Hazey \_\_\_\_\_ he\'s usually stoned on Valium or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on uppers when he has to meet up to meet any parents.

Scene 5 or 6:

Garbage Hank circles the psycho house.

I want to write a scene about Hank making his weird claw boy and dolly girl with the flippers for feet. He collects foreign objects \-- tossed toys, buttons, car parts, hardware no one wants, shaving brushes \-- one \_\_\_\_\_ he sold boys lead like a stand up \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_ in \_\_\_\_\_ in half. Hank is making a love gift, a token of his affections for Rachel the epileptic.

He starts leaving things on her pillow or chair rail, small things at first until he devises the \_\_\_\_\_ of making a \_\_\_\_\_ and girl doll that somehow mirrors his conception of their love conection.

I want to write a scene as one James fishing for maggoty crows in his sheets. Hank watches James put his arm around Rachel after he\'s given her his blanket the night then sets a fire in the long hall, by an exit door for all the kids living at Healing House have to stand out in the freezing olc until the Five Spot gives the all clear.

Hank senses the growing friendship between James and Rachel over the maggoty crow \-- would a squirrel be better? It\'s something Hank would trap \-- be better than some crow Hank finds dropped out of the winter sky like an omen of decay and death.

What else? I want to write a love scene between the sex-crazed Lydia and the Mormon kid she meets in the coffee shop. It\'s a love scene that reverses expectations. Lydia wants to get the poor kid to fuck and he holds her hand as a gesture of friendship for once \_\_\_\_\_ isn\'t \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_ it, it\'s warm and touching like the warmth of a banked fire. It\'s a scene that teaches Lydia that friendship is a necessary component of love. The Mormon boy, raised in a polygamous family, has been tossed out of Utah and has moved to Idaho to live with his ex-communicated brother and go to Idaho Community College and he\'s barely hanging on financially, keeping his body and soul together doing lawn mower repairs which don\'t \_\_\_\_\_\_ on demand in \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_ in the winter. What the Mormon boy, Daniel, wants is a friend, someone to talk to and argue with. He\'s lonely and he doesn\'t expect sex from Lydia which mystifies her.

I want to write some kind of scene at Dr. Lazy & Crazy\'s house. Cold be when the Garbageman empties his trash and finds pill bottle after pill bottle of both pilfered pills from the psycho kids who leave the program. (Lazy isn\'t lazy \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ up the leftover that can\'t be given to recycle to current patients. ) Hank the garbage man saves everything and the pill bottles came in handy for the doll eyes or buttons or \_\_\_\_\_\_. Maybe Hank uses pill bottles he drills holes into as doll arms or legs. If he stacks 2 or 3 of the orange colored bottles end to end they can be arms with duck feet he cuts off a dead Mallard or a Mallard decoy.

Dr. Lazy can\'t run out to Hank\'s truck when he\'s driving away and hand him a grocery bag full of empty bottles with the labels on every kid whose taken \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and Diazapan and Atavans name is on the bottles. No need for Dr. Crazy to write scrips for himself when he can fake the exit of kids who leave the program for a week or two after they exit. Have to figure out when happens in this scene.

Objects that make reappearances in various forms throughout the story:

Antipsychotic pills and their pill bottles

Squirrels or chipmunks

Is there a scene where Dr. Lazy finds a \_\_\_\_ spider in his private bathroom and it freaks him out and Margaret the housekeeper walks in and calmly squashes the spider and says, \"Seriously Hazy? It\'s a bug not the devil.\"

I want to write a scene between Margaret the housekeeper and the cook who\'s a registered dietician but can\'t cook any better than a \_\_\_\_ more inventive than pigs-in-blankets and canned spinach. The conflict is between common sense and high fidelity nutrition \_\_\_\_\_.

\"It\'s not very nutritious if the kids won\'t eat it,\" Margaret says stonily. The cook, who looks like a starving ascetic, says, \"What do you know? You never even graduated from high school.\"

\"I\'ve never killed anybody,\" Margaret snaps. \"Unlike you.\"

\"I have not!\"

\"Not for lack of trying, you skinny bitch.\"

When cook slips on a patch of ice in the driveway where James and his pals spilled a bunch of water for a skate \_\_\_\_, Margaret gets a moment of grace when she makes mac \'n\' cheese and oatmeal cookies. So there\'s a group scene where everybody who lives at Healing House shares a meal and Margaret drops the stupid ritual of confession before the meal and \_\_\_\_\_\_ of saying grace.

Very small like damp cats.

Signal Point,

Hayden Creek,

omming from cda go into hayden and drive North on Gov\'t way you will see a tree nursery on your left and a road just a head to your right called Landcaster you drive up Landcaster and fallow the road all the way around until you come to the Red Farm you cant miss it hourses and a barn that fell down a couple winters ago when you get to the farm instead of fallowing the road around the lake turn left into National Forest and the range is about 3 miles up that road

makeshift shooting areas 

 the dirt pit was carpeted with red and blue gun shells, shards of orange shooting targets.

Toward the back sat the shot-up skeleton of a car frame. Behind it, trees were split in half, shot clean through.

shot-up and obliterated appliances, computers and other trash and debris that had littered that part of the Panhandle National Forest. 

Canfield Mountain, Beauty Bay, Hayden Creek and the Bumblebee Campground area are among the hot spots for summertime bashes in North Idaho.

Trees are still being shot up, he said. People put target in trees, shoot at them and the trees eventually split and break off in the wind. There are a lot of stumps that remain.

Shotgun shells, bullet casings, broken glass, shot-up cans and paper and cardboard targets still litter the area.

volunteers will work the lower Hayden Creek area along Hayden Creek Road that includes the old gravel pit shooting area and another makeshift shooting area nearby.

The roads are a bit too Iced over to get out to the back side of hayden lake, Its one of the sportsmans access points. Lots of places to shoot \
when the back country isnt shut done due to snow and snow machine restrictions are in place.If you go out thru the Garwood sportsman access \
point there is still some open area to shoot. Just icy and slick driving, my son was out there Sunday. pulled out two stuck vehicles.If

Fernan saddle is open, there are areas out there to shoot.

I\'m not a fan of yahoo\'s flagging everyone either.

102614 Dr. Hazey's intake notes on OG

Here is Dr Hazey's handwritten intake notes for Angela Livengood, October 26, 2009.

Dreadlocked. Right ear postholed with a silver studs, many hoops. Bruises under the eyes. Freckles stark against pale white skin that looks like it's never been exposed to the sun.

Escort: Med-Evac Nurse, Jack Darlinsky. Handcuffs. The nurse's hairy arms look like meat hooks compared to her skinny limbs. Fourteen but looks 10 or 11 due to size. Refuses to eat. "Not hungry." Malnutrition?

Her chart lists a variety of possible overdose attempts: Aspirin, Valium, Ex-Lax. Hazes doesn't event want to ask what she was thinking with Ex-Lax. A suspicious involving a fall from a moving vehicle. Paint fume inhalation, two stomach pumps with charcoal, miscellaneous disappearances. Hospital stays, court-ordered incarceration, multiple carefully worded psychiatric statements that outlined grief, withdrawal, depression, negative thoughts, worsening attitude; notes from the psychiatrist who prescribed Wellbutrim, then Zoloft, then Celexa. "No improvement." Hanwritten note on Celexa. "Noncomplient". Letter of concern and consternation from two guardians, Peggy Livengood Haskell and David Haskell, both of Normal, Illinois. Guardians' summary: "No idea what is wrong. Doesn't want to live."

The most obvious thing about this obviously troubled adolescent. She didn't want to be here or anyplace else on this earth.

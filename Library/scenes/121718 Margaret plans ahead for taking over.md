121718 Margaret plans ahead for taking over

Shania Twain on the notebook cover was so out of the mainstream, she seemed to be from an alternate universe. James was used to "Do you know the wae" memes and the teeth-chattering Vine of Kermit the frog shaking from all the pressure to get into a good college. Anxiety, LOL! This girl didn't look like she suffered any anxiety about getting into NICC where the only question was whether to take a few classes or get paid minimum wage making Simplot French fries.

Margaret stood at her back door, peering out at the stars in soft, oft-washed flannel pajamas. The top was Hank's, extra-large so it didn't constrict in bed, and the bottoms were tied with at the waist with a mended draw string. The fabric was so old, it felt like a second skin. It smelled of some comfortable combination of herself and Hank, as if they'd been married so long, they were turning into each other.

Lydia was still missing.

Margaret told herself not to worry. She was probably fine, just upset and whacked out by a visit from her nut-case mother. Margaret had hear via Darlene who'd heard from Dr. Hazey that the mother was nutty as a fruit cake. No wonder Lydia was messed up and struggling with a fly-by mother and a big trust fund and no one in her life who didn't have to be paid to lick a stamp. She was probably off having sex with Ned Simplot, another messed up trust fund baby. Nora would be appalled if Margaret told her he was carrying on with a girl half his age. Did two trust fund babies having sex create a giant fortune? Or just one hell of a fight? Margaret sent up a prayer for Lydia's safe return. She was fine, she just knew it. Look at how much progress she'd made. The look on her face when Margaret complimented her on changing her first gasket. Pure amazement that she could fend for herself without a man as stupid as Ned to rescue her.

Margaret was sure Lydia was fine. Stupid as always. Impulsive. Executive function lacking or nonexistent or nascently developing or growing more neural connections until she was in her mid-twenties. One of the perks of the job: listening to therapists natter about who in their care was doing better or worse. Sure, Lydia had backslid with Ned Simplot and pulled a patch of Dani's hair out but on the plus side, she could change a gasket in a faucet and she'd been nice to Estie of late. Margaret was an optimist. Lydia would grow up or die trying. Though Margaret didn't believe in God -- why would any god let a beautiful young boy like Chase die on her watch---she prayed for all of the children under her care except for Dr. Hazey, for whom she had a much more progressive agenda.
